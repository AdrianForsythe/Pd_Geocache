OhioRider	Found it	7/29/2007	We did our patriotic duty!
The fearsome 4-some attacks PEI and parts of NS and NB that were on our way!  FoggyHoofer, JoliWanderer, OhioRider & Zipalong set out on a caching mission July 29-Aug 3rd. We “took one for the team”, dangled from a bridge dodging bats, donated copious amounts of blood to the local insect population, found new species of thorns which left their mark, discovered ingenious cache containers, met unsuspecting locals who were friendly to the max, had a mud bath gratis to a visit to the “Grande Digue”road where we did a grand dig-out. We stayed at the Bugaboo cottages- a base of operations with lots of nearby caches. Had lunch at exotic locations surrounded by stone cravings in a row, hunted at night for the ubiquitous micros and visited every dirt road in the province- we think.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCNG0E_farewell-to-nova-scotia
OhioRider	Found it	7/31/2007	I prefer ketchup, but this container will do.
