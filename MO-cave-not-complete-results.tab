Team AZMO	Found it	10/12/2013	We decided it was time to do the Grave Hop virtual. We looked over the list and couldn’t really pick which ones we wanted to get. So, we decided to get them all! Of course we had to pick up other caches along the way as well. We spent 3 days in the Springfield area visiting each of the Hops. We saw some really neat cemeteries. We really enjoyed our time together as a family. We ended up with a total of 63 finds (including the Grave Hop)! Day 2 - 26 finds: Another nice quick find. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work. We really appreciate you adding to our caching fun.

I think it's been almost three years since I've been to Springfield and I can't believe all the great new caches you guys have put out since 2004! Again, thanks to all my fellow cacher's for putting these excellent caches out. I've had a great time (as I did last visit), running around looking for fine hides.

OzarksJim	Found it	7/18/2007	Find #970. I got up a little bit earlier than usual this morning, so before I work I had some time to go after this cache, which was the closest one to my house that I hadn't found yet. Only one person drove by while I was there, sitting my car getting the GPS ready. His truck was so loud I thought I could hear it for miles as he drove away. I thought he was coming back to see what I was up to, but he never did. I found the cache in the second place I looked and not the first, but that's only because my GPSr was giving me accuracy readings of 100 feet initially. Signed logbook. I wonder where the cave is around here (if there actually is one)? Thanks for another great cache, Scott! ~OzarksJim - Willard, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC143C3_cave-springs-cache

Cammie476	Found it	3/16/2008	Find 535 Chicocat and I had been planning to do this cache since it came out, so we figured today would be a good chance for us to get it. When e got to the final coords, someone asked us "are you here for the wedding" and we were afraid we wouldn't be able to get near the cache, but we were "early" enough that we had plenty of time before any of the wedding party or guests arrived. I had no idea this cave was here - might have to go back sometime when it is open and take a tour. If it wasn't for the cache here, I imagine I would have never known of this spot. Thanks for taking us here. TNLNSL	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15EAQ_giboney-cave-cache
chicocat	Found it	3/16/2008	Cammie476 and I grabed this one just in time today as the area was set up for a wedding.

Trafftoo	Write note	3/15/2008	As far as I know, the cache is still there, but I haven't checked on it. Several people have had problems finding this one. Either due to getting wrong coords for the final, or from GPS readings near the cave and the rock walls. As my plans for tomorrow have changed a bit, I'll hold off on archiving this one untill I actually get around to picking up the container (if it's still there) later this week.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15EAQ_giboney-cave-cache

I looked all over the area it was suppose to be in. Up, down, to left, and to right for probably an hour but nothing. Oh well, at least the scenery was really nice and the weather was awesome. Will have to take the kids back next time I go there.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15EAQ_giboney-cave-cache

MadDogAnger	Didn't find it	11/24/2007	I have had to go back two days in a row because of too many mugglers around to finish up this cache. Now today - the third day out - there isn't a person in sight, but I could only lock onto 6 satellites in the center of the park (I can usually pick up that many in my house!). . . and once I got on the side of the slope, I had less than 250+ foot accuracy! One "good" lock put me in the middle of the parking lot, the next on top of the hill, the next out in the lake, the next on the opposite hill . . . I waited nearly an hour to get better reception . . . but there was just no finding this one today!

Went out and found 9 more caches then went back and looked for about another hour. I dont know. Things just were not working out for me here. Where my cords took me. Didnt match up with the clue. Both the bullwinkle thing and the wheelchair statment. Were one took me the other put me in the wrong place. Even the difficulty and the terrain was not matching up for me. So I gave up soaked with sweat for the second time today. 2.5 hours of looking to log a DNF. So I called atownmax he went over for 2 hours that afternoon he called me and said he gave up. And went home with a DNF. I dont know maybe it is MIA	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15EAQ_giboney-cave-cache
SterlingConnie	Found it	8/30/2007	Great location for a cache. We've had the opportunity to explore this cave twice some years ago though we didn't go too far back into the cave at those times. When I got to stage 2 I encountered a couple of approximately 10 year old boys playing. One of them came up to me and told me about how he had been in the cave on a tour in the past. After that he headed over to the spring coming out of the cave got down on all fours and started drinking the water. I yelled over to him that the water wasn't safe to be drinking. He informed me that him and his friend have done it "millions" of times and that it was OK to drink. I was also told by one of them that the water coming out of the cave was "exactly" the same water that you buy in bottles in the store but it's got to be the bottles that have a picture of mountains on it.

bosco7	Found it	8/28/2007	# 602...I didn't have all the moon gazing that Ozarksjim had. I saw this cache at 7 am. I knew he was the competition to beat (funny how one gets to know another and some of their habits from these logs). no one had entered a log yet, so i told tix there was a new cache. She said, you better go for it. With a fresh cup of coffee and the gps in hand out the door i went. We Square Dance here every monday night (new class starting sept 10, 7 pm). So i knew exactly where everything was. Ozarksjim was right, easy enough to get all the clues...but that little gem was hidden quite well, my surprise was to see i was about 1 hour behind him, congrads. Thanks for the history lesson and 2TF prize (no winners) see ya down the trail.......... bosco7 [This entry was edited by bosco7 on Tuesday, August 28, 2007 at 12:29:15 PM.]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15EAQ_giboney-cave-cache
OzarksJim	Found it	8/28/2007	Find #1052, FTF #46. I saw this cache was published last evening, but I was watching my son, OzarksRyan, at the time and we had other errands to do. Plus, he was really grouchy so I think a search for a geocache on a hot afternoon would have been a recipe for disaster. So, instead we ate dinner and went to Wal-Mart. When I checked this cache listing later that night, I was amazed to see it hadn't been logged as being found yet. I got up early this morning to see the total lunar eclipse, which was the first one in 7 years. I checked the cache listing again and still nobody had logged this cache as being found yet, so I rushed through my morning routines and headed out the door, hoping to be FTF. I even forgot to pack my lunch. As I pulled out of the driveway, the eclipse was at its peak, and the moon was a dark orange disc hanging in the western sky. While driving to this cache, I found some appropriate solar/lunar themed music to play on my iPod: "Total Eclipse Of The Heart" by Bonnie Tyler, and "Sundown" by Gordon Lightfoot. I found the first and second parts of the cache with no problem, and found the answers easily. Got the final coords figured and entered in my GPSr, and began the hunt for the final cache. That took a lot longer than expected. Even though I was in the park during park hours, I still needed a flashlight to find the cache since the sun hadn't come up yet. I'm glad I brought mine, because it was hidden and camouflaged very well. Signed the logbook, took 1 of the FTF prizes (lottery ticket) and left the other one for the 2TF. I had a lot of fun finding this cache. It's nice to start your work day with a little adventure. Thanks for another great cache and the FTF prize. ~OzarksJim - Willard, MO [This entry was edited by OzarksJim on Tuesday, August 28, 2007 at 8:15:05 PM.]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15EAQ_giboney-cave-cache
*gln	Publish Listing	8/27/2007	Published Congratulations Trafftoo and JT4C . Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site. As a cache placer,* you * have the unique ability to improve (or degrade) the quality of Geocaching in your area. I hope that this cache will be a positive addition. One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one guy here with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . [Green][b] In addition, since we generally need to ask permission to place caches in areas like this, I am THRILLED you have already done so. [/green][/b] Looks fun, Enjoy! Cheers & Thanks for your contributions to Geocaching, Glenn, your friendly Geocaching.com admin.

sjwalking	Found it	6/1/2008	We actually found this one yesterday, but just logging today. I found with Centurion 77 while helping him with another adventure and also met Paradise on this caching trip. Very nice place to visit - but very interesting!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16BA_cave-spring
Paradise	Found it	5/31/2008	I had a great time hiking here today. As soon as I got out of my truck, I noticed two guys with a GPS heading onto the trail. I caught up with them again further in. They are fairly new cachers....one has been caching for a year, the other was on his first hunt. Our paths crossed again as I was heading toward the cave from the bridge, and they were going from the cave to the bridge. I was glad to see them come back to the cave cache after they had located the bridge, because I was a bit spooked inside the icky cave. They were very kind and helped me locate the cache quickly. They also had coords for a third cache in this park that I had no knowledge of, and they let me tag along for the adventure of finding it. Thanks, SJWalking and centurion77, for being great caching companions. I enjoyed caching with you, and hope you continue to follow your GPS's to many more adventures.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16BA_cave-spring

Hobbit Taz	Found it	3/21/2008	Over in the Kansas City Area from St. Louis with Cribbagewitch for a weekend of caching. Our primary goal was to get our 1000th cache find using the Missouri's First cache. We were successfull in getting that one today making it a 19 find afternoon with no-DNFs. One of the few today that we had a nice wooded walk with (and it was a virtual). Found our way through the maze of trails making a couple of wrong turns (one being on a private trail which we didnt realize until coming back out and saw the sign). Really neat seating area near the cave and waterfall (what was the ridge before? we thought it might be an old road or railroad but seemed narrow for either.). Counted the required info.

CribbageWitch	Found it	3/21/2008	OCW HT for a weekend in KC for our 1000th. We really enjoyed this walk out but must appologize to Sylvia as we did not realize that her trail was private until we turned around and walked out. Enjoyed her chickens. We went on down the trail and found the structure. I know how many there are and I put my toes on each and every one. We came back out from the cache area and sat for a bit and enjoyed the falls.

Diermuid	Found it	7/16/2004	Wow, lots of neat historical stuff, I found the Spring easy as pie, but went all over heck and gone trying to get to where my GPS said the waypoint was. It was still .1 mile West but there weren't any clear trails out that way. I counted the planks on four different bridges, but none worked for the certificate. (No sweat really, I was more interested in seeing the spring) I hope to come back when the museum thing is open, hopefully it will have the history on all that old stuff.

BigHef32	Found it	9/12/2010	well, well, well... what a story I have to tell on this cache. OCW bosco7 and tix during the CITO and filling fizzy squares. I decided I needed to do this one, and left bosco and tix on the road for life support as they were geared for a float, not a hike like this. Made my way past the fenced area and started down. Closing in on GZ, I stepped wrong and twisted my foot in my sandal a bit. Found the cache fairly easily and started back out/up. It was then I realized the twist actually blew the side out of my right sandal and my foot was sliding all around. Ended up taking my sandals off and making the entire climb out barefoot. I already get harassed about proper footwear, which usually includes flip flops, but I'm sure this will just make things worse. Oh well, their loss as I filled a fizzy square here today. Signed log BigHef32 w/ bosco7 and tix seriving as life support. LOL. TFTC!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16QRB_coffin-cave-revenge

phenixcachers	Found it	12/8/2007	Found with my cachin'/hiking buddy Sterling today after we had just walked the entire 7.5 mile Natural Tunnel Trail at Bennett. I was kinda worried about the very high terrain difficulty, but actually I would say the hardest part was the initial climb down the steep hillside, then back up it. We just took 'er slow and easy and came out unscathed..haha The rest of the hike which consisted of walking in the gully/trench wasnt bad, except the wet conditions, and the wet leaves made those rocks pretty dang slippery....haha Not to bad tho, just watch your step and take 'er easy. On a DRY day, it would be much easier on the ole' footing..haha Great coords led us right to the treasure box and it was hidden in a cool, perfect hidey hole. Man, that cave looked DEEP! We tried to see if we could see further down into it, but we couldnt. Thanks for the adventure, buddy! Yep--I would say you got your "revenge" on this one compared to the very easy original Coffin Cave cache..haha. Ahhh... revenge. How sweet it is..haha Loved this one buddy and I really enjoy ALL your caches! Thanks a bunch and keep up the great work! Cache on my friend... Scott (phenixcachers)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16QRB_coffin-cave-revenge
SterlingConnie	Found it	12/8/2007	Found this cache with phenixcachers and a friend after hiking 7.5mi on the Natural Tunnel Trail just a little earlier. By the time we got to this cache, most of the rain had stopped and it was just drizzle. All the moisture made this adventure even more tricky. When we arrived at the parking coords a truck went by then slowed down to a stop and backed up to us. It was a hunter who thought we were getting ready to hunt. We told him we were going on a short hike and would be out shortly. We ended up finding the cache without too much trouble and headed back UP to the car. As we passed the cave again, on our climb out we heard a rumble-roar type sound coming out of the cave. Then all of a sudden a coffin came flying out of the cave straight up into the air. Not knowing what a coffin could\would do to us, we all started running for the car. We were running as fast as we could up the hill but the coffin was quickly gaining on us and that's when I remembered I had a pocket full of cough drops. I grabbed a handful of them, turned around, and threw all of em. Then the coffin stopped. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16QRB_coffin-cave-revenge

I just didn't think it'd be this soon! FTF#1. What a drive. What a view! But it rained and my little little car with a bed was thankfully fine. The hide location itself makes me wonder if it would be harder in more difficult weather. Ice? Nice try driving. Water? You're gonna get soaked! Heat? The way back would be fun. T: FTF Prize.

Rockeddy	Write note	12/27/2007	Well, shoot! I hid the cache, never suspecting that there would be restrictions of this sort on public land. It seems that this is one of those inexplicable actions by bureaucrats that frequently leave us all scratching our heads. In this case we owe it to the Missouri Department of Conservation, which many of us belive is not aptly named. Consider that large caliber weapons can be used for hunting on this natural area. But tenderly seaching for a small hidden package is not allowed. A trail is in place there for hiking. You may enjoy that, but you better not be hunting for something you can't kill. Go figure!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC17YBQ_old-reds-cave
*gln	Archive	12/26/2007	This just in. . . Teresa Kight Recreation Specialist. Glenn Hi folks, Sorry but need to let you know that caches at the following links below need to be removed from the area and from geocaching web site. Permission was not asked of the area manager. A Special Use Permit is required for geocaching/letterboxing on Missouri Dept. of Conservation lands. However, geocaching/letterboxing activities are not permitted on some of our Natural Areas - and Clifty Creek is one of those where these activities are not permitted at all. Thanks, Teresa http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=52235526-aa03-4b76-9a5d-298adc7cf96d http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=71a3e9d7-faa4-4df4-bd02-a4be8bb53562 Teresa Kight Recreation Specialist Adopt-A-Trail Program Coordinator Wildlife Division Missouri Department of Conservation P.O.

RicknJoy	Found it	12/15/2007	We had a nice, long walk through the snowy woods to look for this one. The trail took us only as far as Clifty Arch, but it was a fairly easy walk down along the creek to get to the cave. Once we climbed up to the cave we could see how it would be an ideal shelter. We remarked on how, even though it was cold and snowy outside, it was dry inside the cave, and actually quite warm if you climbed up towards the back. We hunted quite a while for the cache - we sure were glad that we had brought a flashlight! It was hard for me to see sometimes because my glasses kept fogging up from the temperature contrast. We finally found the container and were able to read the story about Old Red. We had never heard it before. Wonder what ever happened to him? Signed the log (FTF - WooHoo!), left a wooden nickel and an eyeglass repair kit. TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC17YBQ_old-reds-cave
*gln	Post Reviewer Note	12/14/2007	Congratulations Rockeddy . Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site. As a cache placer,* you * have the unique ability to improve (or degrade) the quality of Geocaching in your area. I hope that this cache will be a positive addition. One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one guy here with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . [Green][b] In addition, since we generally need to ask permission to place caches in areas like this, I am assuming you have already done so. [/green][/b] Looks fun, Enjoy! Cheers & Thanks for your contributions to Geocaching, Glenn, your friendly Geocaching.com admin.

*gln	Post Reviewer Note	3/18/2013	Greetings , I hope it is fixable too! It appears that this cache is in need of repair and has been for a while now. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. Once you have made the repairs make sure you enable the cache again by writing an owners note. If the ”NEEDS MAINTENANCE” attribute is showing you will need to do the following. (visit link) I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I do hope things get fixed up soon. Many thanks, *gln Groundspeak Reviewer [size=1][beige]#ebb4497eeb691338192061447a0fc31a[/beige][/size]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper

dj1974	Found it	9/23/2012	Solved this back in February, but had to have some help because I never have been able to see these things. I tried to find it on a couple of occasions without success. Had another opportunity to be out this way this afternoon and this time I found it. A very unique container to say the least, glad to have this one cleaned off my books. Thanks for the challenge.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper
wood-n-block	Found it	8/25/2012	We'd solved the puzzle earlier & this is first chance to find the cache. It would have been much better in the winter as we had to do a lot of "bush wacking". We also thought that we knew what the cache host should be and we found, what we thought was, it destroyed by mowers. Phoned a friend, Chuck80196, and he confirmed that what we found was not the cache. So, back to bushwacking and we found it. Creative cache. Thanks for the puzzle cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper

I remember staring at posters in the mall when I was a young teen - that was the "thing to do" until you could see it...then the thing to do was tease the others about how they can't see it and you can ;) Anywho - this has been my favorite puzzle by far because 1-it brought back fun memories and 2-I could actually solve it LOL We had struck out on 2 this evening so I was leery about choosing a sterling cache because I always have trouble with them and even when they stare at me - I can't find it L but this one we found and I laughed and laughed! My FAVORITE puzzle without a doubt so far! Thanks Sterling for the puzzle and the container! Loved them both!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper

CaptRussell	Found it	4/15/2009	This was a fun solve. It was also kind of an exciting find. I poked around for a while before finally figuring out the camouflage (duh – missed the clue) but then when I picked up the cache, thousands of ANTS came pouring out of it, all over ME! Too bad there was no one there to video my convulsive self-slappy panic-dance. Just imagine a 46-year old man with the Big Eyes, spazzing out like a terrorized toddler, stomping and swatting and cursing. It was a memorable find. The ants won. They stood their ground, and I left. I didn’t give up the fight until after I had signed the log, though. I mean, I do have priorities.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper

train1904	Found it	12/12/2008	Lordy Lordy, I made it to forty - that's 40 consecutive days with a smiley. This one was worthy of that milestone. When this cache came out almost a year ago, I tried to solve it, but I could not see what I was supposed to see. I knew how it worked, but I could never relax enough to do it. Anyway, yesterday, I looked at it again, and tried a different computer and a different pair of glasses and "magically" I started getting the coordinates. So I decided to make a run for it at lunch today. I had carefully read ScottyLove's log about it and I called Phillip of We2Geeks for encouragement. Before long, I had the cache in hand. Actually, I think I had stepped on it a couple times at least before coming to my senses. This is a nicely planned puzzle cache. With the weather forecast, it looks like my consecutive days record is about to come to an icy halt. Thanks for the adventure.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper

I had solved the clues myself right after it was published... and lost the coords. Then I learned that Preston had a gift for this kind of puzzle when I was having him help me with the Picture This: BDAROWL picture when I thought it might be the same... it turned out not to be, but he can find these clues in under 30 seconds each! I know it took me over an hour the first time. Anyhow, armed with the coords we found GZ and this is a place I had long wanted to place a hide for my Reversal of Fortune series... but this one's been here long before I started that... I really wasn't expecting to find the container when I picked up the object, but when I saw the attachement, I knew I'd scored the prize! The title make sense now. Loved everything about this cache.

PC Flight Crew	Didn't find it	7/1/2008	Okay, so I almost went blind getting the coords from the pictures. Then I hiked a mile and a half from the hotel to find heavy overgrowth at GZ. I gave it the best I could in shorts and flip-flops, but couldn't take the mosquitos and spiders any longer and had to "bug" out. I brushed the leaves and dirt off, and was only able to find one tick. I decided I would have to return better prepared to battle the vegetation. Good puzzle and, it appears, a good hide too.

When the topic turns to evil cache hides, Sterling Con ie's name comes up more often than not. I was in town today and had time for one cache so I pulled out my laptop and found that this one was close. I can see these pics very quickly and solved the puzzle in no time. I could tell that nobody had found this cache recently because I had to bushwack to gz.

Trafftoo	Found it	4/7/2008	Was never any good with those picture things! A few days ago I went and fount the Mine Sweeper hint cache and the hint didn't make much sense at the time. Later it dawned on me where I should look! Finally got to the right place, and when I spotted the cache the hint became perfectly clear! Of 533 previous caches, many have said bring tweezers. I always managed to get the log out, usually without too much trouble. Today as soon as I opened the container I could tell I had nothing with me that was going to get the log out! So, I too took a picture which I will be happy to send along. Had a lot of fun with this one. Really great hide. Took Photo TFTC Find 534	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper
OzarksJim	Found it	3/21/2008	Find #1302 and 1st of 2 finds this afternoon. I never was able to figure out how to read those pictures to get the coordinates for this cache. They reminded me of those "Magic Eye" books that were popular in the 90's. I tried changing the colors on one of them in Adobe Photoshop but that didn't help. So I really just found the coordinates for this one kind of in a round-about way while looking for the "Mine Sweeper Hint Cache" (hope I'm not giving too much away). I had an idea of what I was looking for and I was right. Very clever! However, I was unable to retrieve the logbook. I had my Swiss Army Knife with me and tried several tools to pull it out of there but never could. It looks to me like it's a little damp and packed in there tight. I took pictures to prove I found the cache, in case the cache owner would like proof. Thanks for the cache! ~OzarksJim - Willard, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper

phenixcachers	Found it	1/20/2008	Well ole' buddy, after recently finding the main "container" for your awesome cache called "one of these things", I thought I had "seen it all"...haha But good golly gee....once again my buddy Sterling's extremely clever, ingenious caching mind and his "containers"...took me by surprise and blew me away..haha I just love both yours and bosco7's "containers". Its the "element of surprise" I love about them. You never know what to expect on their caches..haha And those kinds of caches have always been my absolute favorite kind--and they always will be. When I found the container, I just mumbled something like..."no freakin way...you gotta be kidding me"..LOL I just shook my head and then attempted to pick my jaw off the frozen ground..haha The only thing I had a bit of trouble with is trying to put back the "lid", but I think I got 'er on there pretty well. And yes--you werent just kidding when you said "tweezers required"..haha What a Hoot this "container" is..haha Who would have "thunk" it?...haha Just goes to prove my old caching theory and saying that you pretty much CAN make a cache "container" out of ANYTHING, if you set your caching mind to it..haha Fantastic job, once again good buddy! I really love your caches, dude! Keep up the excellent work! Cache on my friend... Scott (phenixcachers)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper
NixaDudes	Found it	1/18/2008	Find 766 WOW! I was already blown away trying to figure out those pictures. I've never been able to see anything in them so I went where you go when you really need help with something...the internet. Found a great little site that taught me some tricks and in no time, I was in the car heading toward the cache. Of course I was expecting the hard part to be over but when Sterling is involved, things are rarely routine. The container was hilarious, although there may be a problem I'll email you about. Thanks so much for another awesome hide!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper

bosco7	Found it	1/2/2008	Went back by myself today, tix was at work. I looked and looked, even though I knew the container I was looking for, it was hard. Finlly I spotted it.

bosco7	Didn't find it	1/1/2008	I spotted these at about 8:45 and couldn't see a thing, I still can't. But I asked tix if she knew what they were called and she didn't know what I was talking about. So she looked at the first one and all of a sudden she saw the number. Then she said, "do you have more"? Well she zipped thru the other nine in 10 minutes. Now that I that i have the coords off we went. Temp was 20 with wind chill, only god knows. We got to the area and found the other brother to this cache and got the hint. Came back and couldn't find it anywhere. Spent 30 minutes in the freezing cold, nose running and fingers frozen. I gave up. I knew Maddog had already found the other ,so there really wasn't much point in being here any longer tonight. Will recalculate and try again tomorrow. see ya on a warmer trail..................... bosco7 & tix ps I give tix all the credit our successes tonight.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1897C_mine-sweeper

train1904	Didn't find it	11/18/2008	I had read previous caches about seeing deer and turkeys. So as I walked to this one, I was wondering how that could be because there was no habitat. Then I started to notice bulldozer tracks. Anyway, I arrived to ground zero to find nothing that anything could even be hidden in except for one power pole. All of the fences, fence posts, brush, trees etc are gone and I assume the cache went with them. I saw Phillip of We2Geeks later this evening and told him about it. He had found it a couple months ago. When I told him what I saw, he just said "its gone" then. So, I'll wait and see what happens. Nice day for a walk anyway.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1898N_mine-sweeper-hint-cache

Signed logbook. I have a couple co-workers who live east of town (in Marshfield) and I was wondering if they saw me walking along here on their way home along I-44?

SterlingConnie	Owner Maintenance	3/22/2008	I checked on the cache today and found it to be about a foot from where it was originally placed.

When I couldn't find it there, I tried looking in other places in case the cache got moved but still couldn't find it.

We parked close to the Mine Sweeper cache and walked to this one. The wind was quite strong out there this morning. We found the cache easily, signed the log, and headed back to the car. Unfortunately, when we got back to the car I realized I had locked my keys in the car. A phone call to OnStar (first time I ever had to call them) got the car unlocked, and then we were on to the next cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1898N_mine-sweeper-hint-cache

phenixcachers	Found it	1/20/2008	Well ole' buddy, FINALLY I was able to get to town to go after this one and the main mine sweeper cache. Was quite the brisk walk to this hint cache, but I hoofed it (haha)--and even caught myself running at times. Not because of the cold, but due to the excitement I get when searching for caches...especially Yours and bosco7's! You just never know what to expect from either of your or Johns caches..and I absolutly 100% LOVE that "element of surprise"!!! Its kinda like quoting Forrest Gump...haha "Sterlings and Johns caches are like a box of chocolates..ya never know what yer gonna git"...LOL Found the cool hide and read the hint and 2 things told me what the hint for the container could be....haha One of them was an incorrect guess of what the container would be and the other I guessed correctly. But still when I found the "container" it was still an awesome "surprise"..haha Thanks for the additional hint cache. Because without it, the mine sweeper puzzle would have never gotten solved without a hint from you, because no matter how many times I tried to see the numbers in those groovy psychadelic images (like wow...man. Far out and groovy..LOL)....I couldnt see a dang thing. Man, I tried everything from staring at them, crossing my eyes and standing on my head..haha Still couldnt see them.

Nite*Owls	Found it	3/16/2019	Geocache #2,882 Staying in Hannibal tonight (from Cedar Rapids, IA) so we hit a few caches. I remember taking my sons through these caves several years ago but at the time we forgot to find this cache. This evening it was just my wife and I here and she made the find while I was petting the fake deer. We were pretty amazed this cache has lasted this long without getting muggled, as the signatures in the logbook dated back to 2008 - especially since the cache wasn't too hard to spot. We also heard what sounded-like tons of cicadas in the trees up in the hills, but it's too early in the year for them to be out so were they possibly bats?	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1ARAD_cave-holler

InxtricablFate	Found it	7/15/2017	County: Marion Delorme Page: MO-025 Found with magtfplanner, skeletor10, and memomls Thanks to all the cache owners who placed these caches for us to find. Logging these now many months late. Sorry to the COs for not giving a great log where deserved.. Time to catch up on well over 1000 caches backlogged for various reasons. If there is an ALR, the answers were sent long ago by my teammates (will resend if deemed necessary). Pics posted where required. Adventure Log: Over our travels of the past few years, magtfplanner and I have laid waste to nearly half of the US Counties . A challenge cache found last year required that we connect the Lower 48 with a solid county-to-county line. Upon examining our maps, we decided what one of our major goals for 2017 would be.; a week-long Midwest trip could connect 4 sections, thereby connecting everything. Another major draw for this trip was claiming 2 more Cache Across America caches [KY and MS], which would put my total to 47, and 3 more State's Oldest [KY, TN, and AR], putting that total to 31. As has become typical, and expected, on this sort of trip, we averaged over 50 caches and over 400 miles per day. memomls and Skeletor10, when they were able to keep up, would send in our Virtual and Earthcache answers almost as soon as we had them, leaving us less to worry about when we got home with 100s of caches to log. magtfplanner and I kept things moving at a good pace and we accomplished all of our goals., despite a major time setback in Lexington. In our 6 days, we claimed 340 total caches!! (225 Traditional, 55 Virtual, 26 Mystery, 26 Earthcache, 4 Multi, 2 Letterbox, 1 Wherigo, 1 Webcam, and 46 Benchmarks) Summer 2017: This year magtfplanner and I orchestrated a most ambitious and exhausting summer with little rest time between trips. This made some of the last-minute trip modifications a bit more difficult but we managed to slog our way through all of our goals. Of course, this left no time for logging so they are all being logged weeks after the fact, hopefully before the finale trip. June 10: New RM challenges, Dollar Puzzle-Art, and Video Game series around Vero Beach, FL. June 11: A very short "local" caching run June 15-20: West Virginia County and Delorme Challenge completion June 24: Numbers Run in Ocala, FL - June 25: Some local caching in NW Jacksonville June 29-July 4: Louisiana Parish and Delorme Challenges July 8-9: Another Numbers weekend around Ocala.

magtfplanner	Found it	7/15/2017	Cache Log: We came here to visit the earthcache, but we took an extra moment for the traditional . What can I say, I am a sucker for signing a physical logbook whenever the opportunity presents itself. A good supplement to running through virtuals in an area . TFTV my new baby 05 ! Day 3 Log: We started at sunrise from our hotel in Mt Vernon, IL . We are still behind schedule from our day 1 miscalculation, but had every expectation of catching up to ourselves by the end of the day . We rode the I-64 into St. Louis where we took a little extra time to make sure we at least found the high priority targets we wanted there . Once done in the city we routed North / East through IL up to a fun ferry crossing in Kampsville and then onward into Hannibal for a tour of “Mark Twain Village” . We shot directly east in MO until we reached Macon and then directly south all the way to the state capitol building in Jefferson City . We finally made it just a couple hours shy of sunrise so we stopped directly in front of the towering spire and napped until the sun shone down on the start of our day 4. When the clock struck 12 AM we took a tally of our finds for the day at 61 total, including 48 Traditionals, 6 Virtuals, 6 Earthcaches, 1 Mystery, and 7 Benchmarks . Adventure Log: Found with inxtricablfate (IXF), skeletor10 (SK10), and memomls on a 6 day road trip through TN, KY, IN, IL, MO, AR, and MS . And what a road trip it was ! Our goal for the trip was to take 4 separate sections of counties on our map and run the finds between them from county to county until we had successfully connected all 48 contiguous states . Our route started off in Nashville, TN; meandered north toward Louisville, KY; cut west to St. Louis, MO; took a round-about way into Jefferson City, MO; shot south to Searcy, AR (just north of Little Rock); and finally back east into Nashville through Memphis, TN and Tishomingo, MS . In 5 days we covered more than 2200 miles, averaging about 440 miles per day with 50-70 finds each day . Despite staying around the Nashville area the last (half) day, we still tacked on an additional 200 miles, rounding us out at 2400 miles in just 6 days time ! Since this is the only road trip we took this year that was not focused on completing a specific state (i.e. WV and LA) we had some flexibility to play with our route to make it bring us right where we wanted to go . This enabled us to finally track down the Cache Across America (CAA) finals in KY and MS; visit the state capitol buildings in KY and MO; and locate the oldest in KY, TN, and AR. Not only that, but we were able to spend quite a bit of time on the freeways / highways, rather than the winding country backroads, so for the most part we made great time enroute from stop to stop . Thanks to the combined efforts and specialties of our caching crew for this trip, we executed a relatively flawless trip (minus the day 1 timing hiccup ) and maximized our time . I glued myself to the driver seat and got us to each find quickly and safely . IXF took the co-pilots chair to manage the navigation and overall trip timing, working through the frustration whenever I ignored his directions . SK10 kept his phone at the ready to provide supplemental satellite imagery whenever we needed a bird’s eye view of a GZ . Memomls took on the mantle as our scribe, keeping our social media accounts actively tagged and sending answers to COs whenever we completed an earthcache or virtual. Because of this awesome team dynamic we managed to secure a whopping 340 Total finds for the trip, including 225 Traditionals, 54 Virtuals, 27 Mysteries, 26 earthcaches, 4 Multis, 2 Letterboxes, 1 WherIGo, 1 Webcam, and 46 Benchmarks . A big thanks to each of the COs who hid the many caches we found on this extended weekend adventure . We couldn’t do what we do with you . Happy Caching !	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1ARAD_cave-holler
skeletor10	Found it	7/15/2017	Found while on a week long caching trip across America with memomls, magtfplanner and InxtricablFate. The goal is counties, counties, and more counties! Our trip starts in Nashville, and we will meander our way through TN, KY, IN, IL, MO, AR, MS, and AL, collecting counties and Delorme pages along the way. We also targeted other caches of interest including virtuals, earthcaches, challenges, and others with high favorite points. Unless otherwise noted, all caches were found in good shape, log was signed, and cache returned to its hiding spot. Thank you for contributing to this awesome adventure! Quick grab while working on the nearby earthcache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1ARAD_cave-holler
memomls	Found it	7/15/2017	Another (probably my last, darn health issues) crazy, jammed packed caching trip with InxtricablFate, magtfplanner, and Skeletor10. The goal this time--connect all the counties! After this trip IXF and mag will have all their counties connected. Me? I still have some work to do. But this trip puts me over 33% of the US counties. As usual we're targeting counties, Delorme pages, virtuals, earth caches, and the ever shrinking webcams. The trip may be tough, the stats are great at the end. I apologize for the cut and paste log but I do appreciate the co's placement and maintaining if these caches.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1ARAD_cave-holler
spiritwolf922	Found it	7/9/2017	Today, we were on another mission: Nan-D1955 needed a cache in Quincy for a challenge cache, I needed to add to my virtual count and we both need more earthcaches. We headed north and soon found ourselves finding some opportunistic caches along the highway. We easily added 300 miles on the Nan-Dmobile during this one-day trip. We grabbed this opportunistic cache while working on the nearby earthcache. Thanks for being a part of our caching adventure!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1ARAD_cave-holler

ZLA	Found it	7/7/2016	My wife's niece was visiting with us this week so we decided to drive up to Hannibal from St. Louis to see at least one cave. We went on the Cameron Cave tour which is fantastic. My wife and I did the Mark Twain cave over 20 years ago which was enjoyable since it talked about the connection with Mark Twain. But from a cave perspective, CC is probably the best we've done. It's the only cave we done where it's mostly in its natural state and going through it with flashlights was great. After the cave tour we had about 30 minutes before we did the Mark Twain Live performance (also worth it) so I fired up the phone and saw a cache less than 200 feet away. So my niece and I did a quick search and found it. There was even a trackable to grab and move along. The cache is perfect for this location.

Bulldog	Found it	7/9/2015	My Mom is 79 years old and is going blind from Macular degeneration and Glaucoma. She has cardiac problems so her stamina is not so great.

JMVonFange	Found it	7/5/2019	The Von Fanges were in Louisville, Kentucky for the 101st Optimist International Convention that was held just blocks away from where the Tyler Hotel, site of the first annual convention of Optimist Clubs was held in 1919, once stood when JM convinced me that we should take a different route home and stop at some of the Mark Twain sites in Hannibal, Missouri and then take a driving tour of my high school stomping grounds in Chillicothe—I agreed since there we so many Mark Twain related and other older geocaches. While we should have gotten an early start today and visited all of the caches in Hannibal on our list before the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum opened this morning, we didn’t and then decided to make a slight detour back into Illinois to add smileys in two more new counties, since GC3ANDJ: Memories of the Green Parrot. helps us to move one step closer to completing GC43JXH: Angry [*$!@`?\ Birds Challenge – OCCT and we couldn’t just skip finding a cache in Pike County. We enjoy stopping at older virtual caches and Earthcaches, like this one, since they often provide us with the opportunity to learn something new and take us to places we ordinarily wouldn’t visit while traveling. With the holiday weekend and National Tom Huck Days festivities, in addition to the Hannibal Bicentennial activities, it was very busy at the cave today and although it has been several years since we have done a cave tour we could not justify waiting until nearly the last tour of the day with more than 300 miles to drive yet today so we gathered the information needed to answer the questions and took a picture to post with our log even though I typically avoid having my picture taken or posting it online; however, since I am using my phone as my GPSr today it is absent from the photo. The answers have been submitted via the geocaching messenger and I am backdating the log to the day that we actually visited this location rather than the day the answers were submitted.

Since I was in the area, and it has been a very long time since I was in a cave, decided to take the tour. This was a great tour. Also, never read any of those Mark twain books, so bought a few.

We met the gals working here, but instead of free loading information, I traded them tree care advice after inquiring about the large Quercus macrocarpa out front. I asked if it was a state champion tree. They said no but our Sycamore is a state champion. That was cool finding that tree. Mahalo for the cachew!.

We were able to get our photo taken outside the entrance, then came back into the shop to visit and ask the questions to help us complete the cache. Really wished we could take the tour. Mrs. iowaPete has always had a strong interest in caving, going back to her college days. I guess we'll just have to come back again. That's okay with me. Soooo much to see in Hannibal.

We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals. At this point we were in the home stretch, having re-entered Missouri and heading back to St. Louis. After an overnight stay in Macon, we spent most of the morning in and around Hannibal. We expected it to be busy with lots of tourists, but it was remarkably quiet today.

Another (probably my last, darn health issues) crazy, jammed packed caching trip with InxtricablFate, magtfplanner, and Skeletor10. The goal this time--connect all the counties! After this trip IXF and mag will have all their counties connected. Me? I still have some work to do. But this trip puts me over 33% of the US counties. As usual we're targeting counties, Delorme pages, virtuals, earth caches, and the ever shrinking webcams. The trip may be tough, the stats are great at the end.

InxtricablFate	Found it	7/15/2017	County: Marion Delorme Page: MO-025 Found with magtfplanner, skeletor10, and memomls Thanks to all the cache owners who placed these caches for us to find. Logging these now many months late. Sorry to the COs for not giving a great log where deserved.. Time to catch up on well over 1000 caches backlogged for various reasons. If there is an ALR, the answers were sent long ago by my teammates (will resend if deemed necessary). Pics posted where required. Adventure Log: Over our travels of the past few years, magtfplanner and I have laid waste to nearly half of the US Counties . A challenge cache found last year required that we connect the Lower 48 with a solid county-to-county line. Upon examining our maps, we decided what one of our major goals for 2017 would be.; a week-long Midwest trip could connect 4 sections, thereby connecting everything. Another major draw for this trip was claiming 2 more Cache Across America caches [KY and MS], which would put my total to 47, and 3 more State's Oldest [KY, TN, and AR], putting that total to 31. As has become typical, and expected, on this sort of trip, we averaged over 50 caches and over 400 miles per day. memomls and Skeletor10, when they were able to keep up, would send in our Virtual and Earthcache answers almost as soon as we had them, leaving us less to worry about when we got home with 100s of caches to log. magtfplanner and I kept things moving at a good pace and we accomplished all of our goals., despite a major time setback in Lexington. In our 6 days, we claimed 340 total caches!! (225 Traditional, 55 Virtual, 26 Mystery, 26 Earthcache, 4 Multi, 2 Letterbox, 1 Wherigo, 1 Webcam, and 46 Benchmarks) Summer 2017: This year magtfplanner and I orchestrated a most ambitious and exhausting summer with little rest time between trips. This made some of the last-minute trip modifications a bit more difficult but we managed to slog our way through all of our goals. Of course, this left no time for logging so they are all being logged weeks after the fact, hopefully before the finale trip.

skeletor10	Found it	7/15/2017	Found while on a week long caching trip across America with memomls, magtfplanner and InxtricablFate. The goal is counties, counties, and more counties! Our trip starts in Nashville, and we will meander our way through TN, KY, IN, IL, MO, AR, MS, and AL, collecting counties and Delorme pages along the way. We also targeted other caches of interest including virtuals, earthcaches, challenges, and others with high favorite points. The answers to the earthcaches and virtuals were submitted by memomls on behalf of the group. Unless otherwise noted, all caches were found in good shape, log was signed, and cache returned to its hiding spot. Please read magtfplanner's log for more details about our visit. Thank you for contributing to this awesome adventure!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
magtfplanner	Found it	7/15/2017	Cache Log: The dude running the entrance to the cave site was fine for us swinging over to the front door for a photo. His resemblance to the namesake of this cave was uncanny and, I suspect, a little more than intentional . Memomls was on top of sending all answers for the team. Pic included. TFTEC! Day 3 Log: We started at sunrise from our hotel in Mt Vernon, IL . We are still behind schedule from our day 1 miscalculation, but had every expectation of catching up to ourselves by the end of the day . We rode the I-64 into St. Louis where we took a little extra time to make sure we at least found the high priority targets we wanted there . Once done in the city we routed North / East through IL up to a fun ferry crossing in Kampsville and then onward into Hannibal for a tour of “Mark Twain Village” . We shot directly east in MO until we reached Macon and then directly south all the way to the state capitol building in Jefferson City . We finally made it just a couple hours shy of sunrise so we stopped directly in front of the towering spire and napped until the sun shone down on the start of our day 4. When the clock struck 12 AM we took a tally of our finds for the day at 61 total, including 48 Traditionals, 6 Virtuals, 6 Earthcaches, 1 Mystery, and 7 Benchmarks . Adventure Log: Found with inxtricablfate (IXF), skeletor10 (SK10), and memomls on a 6 day road trip through TN, KY, IN, IL, MO, AR, and MS . And what a road trip it was ! Our goal for the trip was to take 4 separate sections of counties on our map and run the finds between them from county to county until we had successfully connected all 48 contiguous states . Our route started off in Nashville, TN; meandered north toward Louisville, KY; cut west to St. Louis, MO; took a round-about way into Jefferson City, MO; shot south to Searcy, AR (just north of Little Rock); and finally back east into Nashville through Memphis, TN and Tishomingo, MS . In 5 days we covered more than 2200 miles, averaging about 440 miles per day with 50-70 finds each day . Despite staying around the Nashville area the last (half) day, we still tacked on an additional 200 miles, rounding us out at 2400 miles in just 6 days time ! Since this is the only road trip we took this year that was not focused on completing a specific state (i.e. WV and LA) we had some flexibility to play with our route to make it bring us right where we wanted to go . This enabled us to finally track down the Cache Across America (CAA) finals in KY and MS; visit the state capitol buildings in KY and MO; and locate the oldest in KY, TN, and AR. Not only that, but we were able to spend quite a bit of time on the freeways / highways, rather than the winding country backroads, so for the most part we made great time enroute from stop to stop . Thanks to the combined efforts and specialties of our caching crew for this trip, we executed a relatively flawless trip (minus the day 1 timing hiccup ) and maximized our time . I glued myself to the driver seat and got us to each find quickly and safely . IXF took the co-pilots chair to manage the navigation and overall trip timing, working through the frustration whenever I ignored his directions . SK10 kept his phone at the ready to provide supplemental satellite imagery whenever we needed a bird’s eye view of a GZ . Memomls took on the mantle as our scribe, keeping our social media accounts actively tagged and sending answers to COs whenever we completed an earthcache or virtual. Because of this awesome team dynamic we managed to secure a whopping 340 Total finds for the trip, including 225 Traditionals, 54 Virtuals, 27 Mysteries, 26 earthcaches, 4 Multis, 2 Letterboxes, 1 WherIGo, 1 Webcam, and 46 Benchmarks . A big thanks to each of the COs who hid the many caches we found on this extended weekend adventure . We couldn’t do what we do with you . Happy Caching !	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
nan-d1955	Found it	7/10/2017	Spiritwolf922 and I were headed up to Hannibal and Quincy to pick up some virtuals, Earthcaches, and a cache in Quincy because I needed one there to qualify for an alphabet challenge. We picked up other caches-of-opportunity along our route. Spiritwolf and I are working on a challenge cache that requires us to have 50 Earthcaches, so when we saw that there were 5 in Hannibal, we thought we'd hit the jackpot! We worked through all of them and Spiritwolf submitted the answers for us. My first teaching position was at Mark Twain School in Hannibal many years ago and have been to Mark Twain Cave multiple times. This retired school teacher thanks you for adding to her Science knowledge. That was never my strong subject. The teacher hopes we got an 'A' on our homework. Thanks to all the COs for maintaining their caches and adding to our fun today. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
spiritwolf922	Found it	7/9/2017	Today, we were on another mission: Nan-D1955 needed a cache in Quincy for a challenge cache, I needed to add to my virtual count and we both need more earthcaches. We headed north and soon found ourselves finding some opportunistic caches along the highway. We easily added 300 miles on the Nan-Dmobile during this one-day trip. After a fortifying lunch at 'the Maid-Rite place' (not the actual name of the establishment, but it's apparently what the locals call it), we walked around Hannibal to work on the surrounding virtual and earth caches. Back in the car now for this one, though. Standing at the cave mouth on such a hot summer's day... it was like standing in front of a blast freezer door. Cold air just poured from the opening and we soaked it in for a minute before shivering and heading back to get some more caches before we had to head home. All answers and/or required photos have been submitted to the COs via Geocaching.com's messages. Thanks for being a part of our caching adventure!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

MaxB on the River	Found it	5/11/2017	Caching with Saintvi and working our way back home after a 10 day road trip caching counties of KS, OK and TX. I was interested in the traditional cache here to drop a TB for Iowa, SaintVi found the earthcache. What a nice place, no room to join a tour, but next time through the area will remember and return. Saintvi emailed the answers and the staff was really nice and friendly. Thanks for the cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
saintvi	Found it	5/11/2017	On the way home to Michigan after a ten day county caching run with MaxB On the River through southern Kansas, northern Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle. Last night Max said we would stop at the Mark Twain Cave on our way home, so I pulled up the list of Hannibal caches, found one named Mark Twain Cave and thought, "Cool! An Earth Cache!" I didn't have my GPSr with me in the hotel room, so I jotted down the coordinates and the questions before packing away my laptop and going to bed. Today as we neared Hannibal, I said something about the Earth Cache and Max said, "What Earth Cache?" "The one at the cave." "There's an Earth Cache at the cave?" Turns out she was looking for a traditional cache to drop a TB in before we crossed the river. I had no idea there was a traditional here, as it was late and I was sleepy and didn't look at the map. So we were happy to have a "twofer" here. The staff was friendly and helpful. One was curious about geocaching and came out to help us look for the traditional cache and take our picture outside the cave entrance. The tours were fully booked with school children, so we browsed the gift shop, got our answers, found the cache outside, posed for pictures and hit the road. It was a nice stop and someday I hope to make it back to tour the cave. Answers are on the way. Thank you for bringing us here.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

We took time to tour the cave. Our tour guide was great, we did a moment of complete darkness in the cave, and I took tons of pictures of different signatures that were over 100 years old! We learned there were over 250,000 names signed on the cave walls, until 1972 when it became a national landmark. Thanks for the great location and information.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
The Weasel	Found it	10/16/2016	Out with Croling, C4!, and L7! aka "Team Freal" for a fun filled weekend at Geocoinfest. The weather was perfect for grabbing all sorts of smileys. We prepared well in advance solving puzzles and picking out caches we wanted to grab for this weekend. We completed a few geoarts, several puzzles, some WIG's, some multis, some letterboxes, and of course some tradtionals. In the end, we rounded up around 250 caches and some great stories along the way. Geocoinfest was a blast. I'm glad I left my wallet in the car otherwise I would have gone braoke buying coins. For the eartcaches and virtuals that were found that needed to have answers sent to the CO's, those have been sent by another member of our group. TFTC!!!

Bulldog	Found it	7/9/2015	My Mom is 79 years old and is going blind from Macular degeneration and Glaucoma. She has cardiac problems so her stamina is not so great. She has always enjoyed traveling but cannot drive anymore so I take whenever and where ever I can. We are on a 5 week trip to our original tribal lands (we are Potawatomi). So I planned this trip to get her to see as much as we can cram in. Of course we had to check out all things Mark Twain while in Hannibal. We were lucky enough to go to the cave on a weekday and we were the only 2 people in the group and the guide was so sweet to let my Mom take her time. I have been in many caves but never one that was mostly limestone. It was a great tour.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

kaiwarrior	Found it	5/25/2014	I had a great time on a road trip with Joe Friday and SWAG Dragon. We left Thursday morning at 4:15 from Colorado and arrived at the hotel in St. Lewis MO 20 hours later. Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip. We only found 100 caches total including all the events. Every one of the caches was special for some reason. I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches. Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history. I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away. The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix. Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going. I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
FWIA	Found it	5/25/2014	What a weekend this has been! My first Geowoodstock and a memorable visit to the area where I used to live here. Met many new cachers from all over the country and, of course, got to hang out wit KUMI (Kansas, Utah, Missouri, Iowa) That's the team name for ,yself, bucknuts, louinliberty, hockabee & baa daata. It's always a guaranteed good flippin' time when this group gets together. This weekend was no different. We spent Sunday cleaning up a few more caches, WIGS, etc we had on our radar. Hannibal was a needed stop for me on the way home because I wanted to get some of the Virtuals & E/C's in the area. I came here many. many years ago as a child on family vacation. That's when we toured this cave and I still remember that tour. I was scared to death the cave was going to cave in on us. Had great memories coming back here. Thanks for that! Blue ribbon awarded.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
24hawki	Found it	5/25/2014	Heading home from Geowoodstock XII in St. Charles, MO with cneumann98. The plan of the day was to concentrate on some special caches in Hannibal and find at least one cache in each county we passed through on the way. On-board 21st century technology sure helps with this kind of plan!! We followed the instructions on the cache page and were extremely pleased the person behind the counter knew exactly what we were asking for. She assigned a guide who took us to the cave entrance and was well versed with the questions we asked. Even though we didn't have time for the tour, this one has earned a favorite point since it is extremely apparent the CO has worked with the personnel at this site to ensure all cachers visiting this location can claim their smiley. Well done!!! Email with the required answers to follow!! TFTEC!! 24hawki Clinton, Iowa	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
cneumann98	Found it	5/25/2014	24hawki and I were headed north towards home after the festivities of Geowoodstock XII. Her suggestion was to hit Hannibal on the way, so we got ourselves ready for a whirlwind afternoon in Mark Twain's city. I visited this cave YEARS ago when I was little, but it was 24hawki's first visit. I think I'm going to have to take my entire family back here and go camping and spelunking! The folks at the counter were very helpful and quickly had us getting the information (and picture) that we needed. A very well-done earthcache, indeed! TFTEC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
bucknuts	Found it	5/25/2014	[blue]It was GeoWoodstock weekend. This was my first ever GeoWoodstock event, kinda still kick myself for not going when it was in Seattle. Met up with the normal cast of characters TEAM KUMI...Louinliberty, Hockabee, Baad Daata, FWIA, Busterbabes and me. Of course Busterbabes did have her daughter and sweet looking 2 month old grandchild along. Just a crazy weekend...some foreshadowing happened early Friday night at the Flash Mob when several hundred people convene for the 15 minutes. Then one of the tenants comes screaming out and yelling that the group was on private property. I threw my nerf football at Monrose and got the heck out of there before the popo came. Speaking of screaming, then on Saturday a non-cacher was yelling at a cacher in the parking lot for taking pictures of cars. I thought to myself, lady you better get ready not only are people taking pictures of TB's on the back of cars, but just wait. When you cross that bridge people will be taking pictures of t-shirts, badges, tattoo's and all kinds of number combinations. Team KUMI ate two nights at the Texas Road House in St. Charles. The first night we celebrated FWIA birthday. She got up in the saddle and I was glad she didn't have a whip or she might have smacked me. But timing is everything as she was eating her ice cream and I cautioned her about what might happen if she ate too much of it. First night Hock's meat wasn't to her desire, second night she ordered it in size instead of ounces. Second night half the table missed their sweet potato. Saturday morning did the northern bike trail. Go figure I have about 4 miles to make it to St. Charles and I have a flat tire. So I had to walk the bike the rest of the way. Hit two events then went to the local bike shop to get it fixed. The guy said "Can you leave it for 2 hours", I replied "Not Today". Got it fixed so we could do the southern bike section later in the day. While doing that one, I somehow got myself inside a gated golf community and couldn't get out. They had gates to get out. Eventually, I asked a guy mowing his yard how do I get out of this place. He gave me the directions and off I went. Whew...that was 20 minutes that I'm not sure how I did that. Met the fine folks of Determined2 on the southern portion of the trail and got to talk some Buckeye talk...sweet. Make sure to wear long pants and shirt for this trail as the poison ivy is thick. I did pick up two hitchhiker ticks while bike riding today. FWIA says she DNF'd a couple of caches and needs some help. Well after going back and discovering the first one was a coffee can. Huh??? You DNF'd a coffee can? Then the next one where she spent 15 minutes leaving with a frown we had in our hands in about 30 seconds. Later in the weekend, she spent 20 minutes on a bridge wheelchair accessible with a DNF...yep I found that one too. So the score just after this weekend is bucknuts 3, FWIA 0. Poor Louinliberty received some paperwork from Missouri finest at the event. Speaking of Missouri finest...wow they sure were out in force this weekend keeping the area safe. Thanks to all the people which hide the caches and hosted events for my first ever GeoWoodstock. It was awesome. Signed logs either bucknuts or Team KUMI.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

swr rat	Found it	5/22/2014	Found with the wife "the mouse" as we toured the area before heading down to St. Charles for GWXII. We came out to see the cave but decided to ship the tour as the wife doesn't do well on long distances (two total hip replacements on one side make it a bit tough for her, but she has survived cancer). Checked out the shop took some pictures and headed on down the road. It is no wonder that geothermal cooling is so effective after feeling the breeze coming out of the cave door. Will get email answers out soon. TFTC SL	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

Unitzoid	Found it	11/30/2013	Thirty on the Thirtieth #9 (12:25 PM) Walking up to the cave's entrance, I couldn't help but smile. This certainly seemed like an awesome place to explore! Alas, time would prevent a thorough examination of this cave and its passages. I'd have to settle for making observations of the exterior. Some questions remained unanswered, though, so I sought the help of an employee. Answers were cheerfully given as was aid in taking a photograph at the entrance. A few of the artifacts inside the gift shop were looked over before it was obvious Atomic Goat's Breath and I needed to continue on our way. Thank you for highlighting this geographic feature! Answers to the questions posed are on their way via electronic mail.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

My thinking was that I would get on the back side of the rain and stay dry. Hopefully I would end up back in Springfield by 7:00 pm. Things worked out pretty well. Replaced my cache, found 25 caches on my route and 2 of those were FTF's! Best of all, no DNF's! The rain thing worked out well too. By the time I reached Fort Scott, there was no rain!

wanderfish	Found it	12/29/2014	Woke up two mornings ago with the realization we have three more vacation days together and this is the first day since vacation started we didn't have any plans at all for the day.....what to do??? An impromptu geocaching trip to Missouri to finally light up some more counties we hadn't visited yet! After some fun at the indoor shooting range in Olathe we decided to head South and see how many more new counties in MO. we could get. We meandered our way to Springfield where we decided to book a night and see how much more caching we could get in...when we ended up in Branson my love surprised me again with the idea of staying the night in Branson....so we could get some more area caching in ...lighting up new counties along the way. This marks our 20th stop of the day as we cache our way back towards Lawrence, KS since sadly - Val must return to work tomorrow. Thank you for our 3070th find overall on a sunny, cold 41 degree Monday afternoon. Found around 3:10pm TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2TN_your-court-or-mine

One of 12 caches found with my fella absoluteimagery, out for a day of caching and working on a few challenges (Missouri Delorme Challenge GCQA2X, Kansas I See Dead People Challenge GC2YY00, & Another Busy Day: Missouri Container Challenge GC3GN56). A wonderful day out caching with my sweetie!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2TN_your-court-or-mine
TrumanCachers	Found it	10/6/2012	One of 12 caches found w/ my lady MissMaar on our day of attempting a couple challenges (Missouri Delorme Challenge GCQA2X, Kansas I See Dead People Challenge GC2YY00, 12 Counties In A Day Challenge GC3CCW4, & Another Busy Day: Missouri Container Challenge GC3GN56). Someone (me) misread the counties challenge & after about 10 hrs on the road, we had to call it an "early" day due to the fact we were still a few counties short of 12 (I thought it was 10). Great day of caching tho as we did knock out a few Delorme grids & completed the container challenge (just have to go to that actual cache to sign the log).

marco and polo	Didn't find it	7/25/2002	We looked and looked but had no luck! No rock was left unturned! We did however find a McDonalds cup and a working lighter. We where both too chicken to go into the cave though, it sounded like there where vicious racoons in there! Walking back with our heads hung low we ran into a fellow cacher on his second trip, starting to suspect cache has been foiled!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
ravenbrk	Didn't find it	7/25/2002	Second attempt for this cache. Came alone this time. Just finished finding the Springfield Lake Cache, so my hopes were high for this one, too. Inside gate was already locked at 6:30 p.m., so had to hike in again this time. Met up with some other cacher's who said they had just searched unsuccessfully for the cache for 30 minutes to an hour. I went ahead and gave it a short search of about 15 minutes, but I couldn't find it either. Maybe someone walked off with it.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
ravenbrk	Didn't find it	7/21/2002	Long hike down from the main parking lot, but found the cave pretty easy. family got restless before I could find the cache, though. They also were worn out from the hike and sent me after the truck, but I got out to the main lot to find the park ranger had already locked the gate. I walked back down to them and gave them the bad news and as we walked the rest of the way out the park ranger came zooming through on his final rounds and nearly ran over us. On his way back out he rather rudely told us it was time to lock up the main gate. I didn't bother to tell him if he hadn't locked the inside gate early we would already have been gone. :-) I'll come back later and try this one again.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
Cat E Wampus	Found it	6/9/2002	This will always be one of our favorite finds. An easy hike for most of the way with a little adventure near the end. Packed a flashlight only to realize at the cave that we had left it in the car. We left Michigan on Friday for a wedding in Republic and knew a little cache searching needed to be in our plans. We ran short of time and were glad this is the one we decided to seek out. Removed a Wisconsin lucky traveler coin and placed a Canadian $1 coin.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache

mo dman	Found it	5/11/2002	This was a great spot for a cache. We had a great view of the rain swollen river below. Ran into a whole crew of fellow cachers...got to play with their little puppy, Samuel. Nice bunch of people with the cutest little ones. Had little trouble finding the goods. Took a small plastic frog, left a Manchester United Soccer keychain. Thanks again for the fun.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
RanDeeKayMil	Found it	5/11/2002	Messy, messy, messy! The rains we've had during the past week have really made this a muddy and slippery cache site. Took along Ran's brother and his 5 and 6 yr. olds, our 7 yr. old daughters, and our puppy, Samuel. Fortunately, we ran into other cachers on our way down the hill and they helped the kiddos make it the rest of the way down. Thanks for the help!!! :o) Left nothing (small jar for cache)...took Wisconsin postcard (in honor of Jason and Kelly who introduced us to the sport and logged all of our finds under their names!!! ;-> )to place in an Oklahoma cache soon.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
billyjack	Found it	5/4/2002	Nice cache with lots of Wisconsin stuff in it! I slipped on my butt in the mud right near the cache. I'm not too sore from the experience. The park sure is more than what I expected at first. What a great place so close to town. We were visiting our son at SMS and introducing him to the sport. billyjack	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
Sgt Pathfinder	Found it	4/29/2002	Sgt Pathfinder & Pvt Pathlearner visiting from wisconsin, along with relatives, enjoyed the search of this nicely placed cache. We came from the west, and were standing right on top of it before we realized we were there. Went back into the cave about 45ft. Pretty neat inside, but I won't spoil it for you. Took nothing from the cache, but left Wisconsin lottery tickets, a lucky travelers coin, and some hitch-hiker Wisconsin post cards. Also covered cach with plastic bag as it was exposed. Word of warning; be careful of snakes, (we stumbled across a lazy copperhead on the way back)Now that I think of it, I did bring something back. TICKS!! Pulled the little rascals out the next morning. Still enjoyed the cache and the trip. [last edit: 5/5/2002 8:28:59 AM PST]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache

MTBguy	Found it	4/6/2002	April 6, 2002, sometime in the afternoon. I was in town staying with my brother (RacerB) for a mountian bike race on the 7th. We could see the parking lot for the race at the Sac River trails from the cache. Neat area, I wonder how many other caves are around waiting to be explored? Found the cache after looking for about 15 min. Told another guy about GeoCaching while we were there. Took nothing, left nothing. Oh, We saw two HUGE black snakes sunning themselves on a log! At first we thought is was one snake, till we poked it with a stick and one of them went in a hole in the ground. The Mountain Bike Guy from Joplin MO.

RacerB	Found it	4/6/2002	Tricky spot to find, but we did it. Came with my brother, MTBguy... we spent the day at the mtb trails across the river, and had to come find this cache. Apparently we were the third to find this cache today, but the first to log it! Never saw anyone else with a GPS, though. Took a light along, explored the cave a little. Wonder if it ends up connecting with Fantastic Caverns?	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
BruceS	Found it	4/2/2002	This was the last cache on my 4 1/2 day 33 cache trip across southern Missouri with a side trip into Arkansas. Nice walk into this cache.

BeechCachers	Found it	3/23/2002	Great Park. Beautiful day with lots of people around. We were greeting by a group of little girls who were there with their parents. Dad looked a little wearey in trying to keep up with them. Stopped and took a few pics of the bridge and waterfall. Thanks for hiding it.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
Bonafide	Found it	3/17/2002	Ended up on the wrong side of the river, directly across from the cache container. Walked back to the car and drove around. Had great difficulty getting to the cache. Great hiding place, but slick, steep terrain. Great walk and enjoyed by all, including the dog. Took mardi gras beads, left rain poncho.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
wolfmann	Found it	3/8/2002	Found this pretty quick and even met a lady and introduced her to the game. She said she was going to check out this site later and call someone in Colorado that hikes all the time, to see if he has hear of this game. Anyhow, took nothing and left nothing. <P> Wolfmann slipping and sliding. Kansas City KS	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
Ox & Just Ducky	Found it	2/23/2002	Took me a while to get around to logging this one: Got so caught up in the scenery that we took a wrong turn and had to back track.

YOSA-2	Found it	2/3/2002	I visited the site this morning at about 11:30, the ground was muddy, and it was a bit difficult managing the dog and leash on this terrain, but we did it. I took a United States flag pin, and left a tupperware keychain. YOSA	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
nanobyte	Found it	1/12/2002	The daughter and I had a nice slide down to the cache this afternoon. We had a lot of fun, this was our first cache and we are looking forward to our next. Thanks Took the happy face charm left a pen.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
cearl	Found it	1/7/2002	Took my Dad for his 1st hunt. We are from NC and really enjoyed the visit to Springfield, MO. On our way into the park we saw quite a few ducks in the pond and a Bald Eagle up in the tree. Really pretty there with the snow on the ground. Once we got to the cave site we were with in 30 ft of the cache. It was a little slippery on the hillside with the snow. But even my 70 year old Dad made it with out too many problems. Found the cache in about 10 minutes. Thanks for all the fun. We really enjoyed exploring the cave. We took nothing and left a Red Geo Rover truck in a plastic bag. This is a traveling item and I found it here in NC at the Big Woods cache site N 35° 45.858 W 079° 03.144 (WGS-84). Steve Oneil was the individual who originally planted this item. He can be contacted at this email address thesolorover@yahoo.com. He wants to keep track of where it travels so who ever gets this item please email him to let him know where it has traveled to. Thanks again. Craig Earl	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
Rattlesnake	Found it	1/5/2002	My wife and I set out for our first geocaching adventure. It was snowing today and pretty slushy. I almost decided to follow the straight line on my GPS receiver (through the field)but went ahead and followed the gravel trail. I am glad I stayed on the trail. We found the site without too much trouble but the slipper leaves were a challenge. Signed the log book and was off to the next on our list. We had a nice walk and a lot of fun.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache

raygun_88	Found it	12/29/2001	It was a great day for a hike. I love the area. Thanks for putting a geocache there. It is my first in nearly five months, and first of four that I visited today. The cache is in good shape. I took nothing and left nothing. Ritter Springs Park is my old stompin' grounds from 15+ years ago. I recall being shot at when I was cresting the ridge above some years ago. It was an accident; a bird hunter across the creek didn't check beyond his target. I felt the blast and was rained upon with bird shot that hit the tree above me. But for a few inches I suppose I would be known as One-eyed Raygun.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache

denrick	Found it	10/5/2001	Wow, what a mess. Me that is. The dog and I found the gravel trail by the dead end road. Walked the trail, dog on my left arm, umbrella and gps in my right hand, got full of stickers and wet as it was raining and had rained during the night also. As we got near our destination I figured I would leave the trail and cut across the woods to save time. What a joke that was. Ran into fences and have you ever walked through the woods with a 4 foot golfing unbrella carrying a dog. Found the cave after slipping and sliding along the trail. Found the cache, as I was writing in the log the dog started sliding down the hill while trying to climb up it. I managed to grab it before it got out of reach. Left a lucky Buckeye and took nothing. Had a great time, enjoyed the challenge even though we were all wet, covered with stickers and mud.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache

moberrys	Found it	9/13/2001	We gave this a second try after the ground dried out. Didn't have any trouble at all this time. Found it right away. Very nice spot when its dry. Didn't take anything or leave anything. Vernice and Larry.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
moberrys	Didn't find it	9/9/2001	The trail started off real good and easy but turned into a very difficult trail at the end of the gravel and up the hill. We kept sliding back because of all the rain the night before. We got within 30 ft of the cache and decided to give up and try again when the trail dried out. We were afraid we would end up in the river if we kept going. Please be very careful if you try this while its wet. Vernice and Larry	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BCB_cave-cache
Mongo	Archive	9/23/2011	[b][u][red]ARCHIVING CACHE[/b][/u][/red] Greetings cache owner, I have been looking at caches in the area that have been temporarily disabled for a while now and it looks like your cache has been under the weather for some time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time I don’t think we can do so any longer. Therefore, I have archived this cache. If you haven’t done so already, please pick up any remaining cache bits as soon as possible. When repairs to this cache are completed, and it is time to have it listed once again it will be no problem as long as it still meets the guidelines. Just drop me a note( by email at Mongo@geocachingadmin.com) and let me know the GC waypoint number of the cache or better yet, the URL of the cache page. You will still be able to access your cache page just as before by going to your “My Cache Page” and clicking the link of your cache. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future. Thanks for your understanding, Mongo Groundspeak Reviewer	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1C3FT_bryces-cache-cave

BlueBeadMan	Found it	11/14/2009	Mission accomplished--well, for the most part. I was caching without my normal caching partner 2_cats because she had some mother-daughter fencing clinic or something to go do. I wasn't about to let the weekend go to waste sitting around home doing nothing. So I hopped in my big truck and trudged along at about 14 miles to the gallon on a 500 mile or so cache trip around the northern central MO counties picking some caches and more importantly getting some new counties on my attempt to complete the MO County Challenge. I did well; planned to attempt 23 caches, then I dropped one from the list (too many previous DNFs). Four others were DNFs, but only 1 of the DNFs was due to the first day of hunting season. It's bad when you pull up to the parking area and hunters dressed in orange are headed into the woods and you realize that you still need to go .25 miles in the direction they are going. Then after finding the other caches on the original list, I added 3 more before darkness set in. All in all, it was a good day--very long and tiring--but good. This was one of my finds. For this cache, I was too busy staring down the construction who was staring me down for caching to notice much about the cache site! Thanks! TNLNSL--Thanks again for the cache!

Reviewer of the Cache	Post Reviewer Note	5/9/2008	Congratulations wishing on a star. Since your new cache "Bryce`s cache cave" seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site. As a cache placer, you have the unique ability to improve (or degrade) the quality of Geocaching in your area. I hope that this cache will be a positive addition. [green] [B]In addition, since we generally need to ask permission to place caches in areas like this, I am assuming you have already done so.[/green][/B] Enjoy!

*gln	Post Reviewer Note	6/13/2009	Greetings, I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs. I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. [b] If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches. [/b] If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. From the guidelines... http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint "... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b] normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing." Thanks for your understanding. When you have made all repairs, please remember to post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute! [B][RED]HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS[/B][/RED] Respond by posting a new [b] Note[/b]. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select "Post Note" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.

bosco7	Found it	3/7/2009	Interesting comment by TNT. Those sand duners, caused sand on the highway. When we were there a truck and patrol car had traffic slowed down while the street was sweeped clean. We passed the patrol car twice...so he recognized us. After we did the "Peace Church Cache", that same partrolman drove by. As we left that cache, he followed us.

Used to ride 4x4s here every weekend looong ago. Would think I would've known better than to pull in so close for lighting. ROFL Yep... soon had someone pull up asking, "Get yer truck stuck?"... Thankfully, he had a chain & we were back on our way in a fairly short amount of time. Unfortunately, as soon as the chain was unhooked & we turned to offer some compensation & massive thanks.... poof he was already headed down the road. May good karma follow our mysterious helper wherever he may roam. Thanks for the adventure & cache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1CHEQ_sands-of-mine

likestocanoe	Found it	8/24/2008	This was the favorite cache of the day for likestocanoe2... she wants to come back with the four wheelers and "play". We were caching with NWANaturals and the Mrs. found this one while the rest of us were not watching .... next thing you know we hear the ringing sound of, "Found It". The log camo was great and matched it's surrounding very well. Great Job!!! We spent quite a bit of time just playing, climbing, looking and imagining what the place looked like and what future generations would think of the things we leave behind. What the locals consider an eye sore - us foreigners enjoyed. Thanks for bringing us here, for the cache and for the history lesson.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1CHEQ_sands-of-mine
NWANaturals	Found it	8/24/2008	This was one of our two favorites of the day. The coordinates were just a little off, but all the fun we had exploring the area made it worthwhile. Mr. NWANatural pondered whether future generations would question the purpose of these "ruins." Mrs. NWANatural, who was responsible for finding this one, thinks the cache should have been named "The Next Stonehenge." It was a lot of fun!

Reviewer of the Cache	Post Reviewer Note	5/23/2008	Congratulations SpiritGuide. Since your new cache "Sands of Mine" seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site. As a cache placer, you have the unique ability to improve (or degrade) the quality of Geocaching in your area. I hope that this cache will be a positive addition. [green] [B]In addition, since we generally need to ask permission to place caches in areas like this, I am assuming you have already done so.[/green][/B] Enjoy!

Iamgrateful	Found it	6/5/2018	OCW beladi1. I am grateful for my friend Marilyn eh. We met up at 9:30 am and had a terrific day caching the upper part of Cliff Cave. Such a cool park...nice new trails...but amazing quiet old trails that I like better eh. This was one of the cool caches we found. Thanks for the fun. Every cache is exciting....a new location, a new experience and a new adventure. It's magic. I am grateful. Thanks for helping me keep my streak alive, thanks for my daily dose of happiness, Tftc and Cheers from Canada eh ;-)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DE4_cliff-cave-cache
vorlon40	Found it	5/19/2018	I had to grab the cache that is the namesake of the park. Now to head back toward the car after a long afternoon. TFTH. My first trip to Cliff Cave Park. I brought my bike to use for the lower half but just barely finished much of the upper half before I ran out of time, the weather started to turn bad and I got tired (after 4 hours and 7.5 miles of hiking). Well, hiking may be a misnomer. There was a lot of bushwhacking since the old trails seem to have gotten harder to find with the new trail construction and the new ones didn't show up on my GPS map. Some of the old trails are so overgrown they are really impassible. I'll have to come back for a 2nd trip. #1539, 15th of 16 found today.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DE4_cliff-cave-cache
tc54915	Found it	4/21/2018	Spring break caching with my niece Abigail here in OKlahoma area. Trying to get virtuals, webcams, oldies and a few in between that we can grab. We wanted to increase our numbers in this state and seen this power trail. We managed to grab a few, but quit earlier than I wanted as some of the coords were off by 60-80 feet and the clues were tree and there was no tree around..

TerriBikes+	Found it	2/18/2018	Caching and playing in Cliff Cave & Spring Valley Trail area. This grand old cache is now easily accessible from brand new paved trail. You can still take old dirt trails to get closer to the hide. I saw the container some 20 ft away so after signing the log, I geoflaged it much better. All is well with cache now. Such a great day and great place to explore and climb down rocks to the cave entrance and creek. I needed this Jasmer filler too-so this day was really fun for me. Thanks so much.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DE4_cliff-cave-cache

koneko	Found it	5/27/2014	My last day in Missouri for the Geowoodstock event was spent with some of my absolute favorite caching peeps, Bud and Sun-moon-starz. I had heard that there were a few caches out here not to be missed, and Bud and SMS were nice enough to indulge my desires to, well, not miss these! Was nice to be able to snag an oldie this one, too. This was a quick find along our way in between birds. I had such a great time caching in Cliff Cave Park - Thanks to all that took the time to place such great caches!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DE4_cliff-cave-cache
sun-moon-starz	Found it	5/27/2014	Bud, Jenn, and I came back to find this one after solving Amazing Bird. My new GPSr showed me how very quickly it runs down the batteries on the trail as it turned off on the way to this cache and would NOT power back up. Guess I learned something so experience was a good teacher and Jenn saved the day by having her GPSr loaded with more battery power. Thanks for highlighting this excellent hiking area with this cache. We scrambled up from the cliff, making it an extra adventure. Thanks again for the cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DE4_cliff-cave-cache
David	Found it	5/25/2014	11:14am #31603. Eggsilent4 and I took a 5 day, 8 state tour with a visit to GeoWoodstock XII in St. Charles, Missouri right in the middle. We stamped most logs as Team LaB! ([b]L[/b]ike [b]a[/b] [b]B[/b]oss[b]![/b]), while some were signed individually. Another oldie on on the path sounded interesting, so a stop was in order. Nice walk and cache, all is well.

Rowbean	Found it	5/25/2014	Found while exploring with the Traveling Armadillos and looking4caches. Wonderful location! Loved the trek up to the cache!

As I was slowly making my way up the icy trail, I came across a guy out walking his dog and he remarked how the trails were a little treacherous today.

Daerias	Found it	7/31/2012	On my way home to Ohio after visiting family in Missouri, I took a day to cache in St Louis. I enjoy hiking and caching and this seemed like a good place to start. After visiting the cave entrance I made my way up to the cache. I got lucky figuring out which trail to take and once I was at GZ it didn't take long to find the cache. 4 of 21 for the day.

shalimargeosearchers	Found it	6/20/2012	We are here from NW FL as we are driving to NE to see family and then will head further north and finally return home. We have several special caches on our to do list, since we dont have the really old ones near our home. Getting these old caches hid in 2000 and 2001 are special to us. We are trying to finish our Jasmer Grid and if things work out we will get that done by the end of this year. Well, hiking up to the cache was eventful as we are retired and arent used to hiking on hills. We did pretty good as from car to cache to car was about 30 min. We never saw the cave but did see a couple paths that we guessed led to it. We hurried off to our next cache find. Thanks for placing and maintaining this old cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DE4_cliff-cave-cache

Team AZMO	Found it	6/24/2016	Day 1 of our geo-cation. Today we head north to Hannibal, MO, piking up a few caches along the way. Stop number 2. We are claiming a find on this one with the COs permission. The coords for this one were spot on. The container, however, has seen better days. The lid is gone. The zip lock bag that someone put the rest of the container in is torn and providing no protection whatsoever. The "log book" is a hunk of papercrete in the bottom of the box. The CO has been notified and arrangements have been made to get this one replaced with a different container and contents. We met the lady who owns the winery and she was very nice. We would like to thank javapgmr for all your hard work in placing and maintaining this cache. We appreciate you keeping the addiction going.

I figured there must be a cache around here somewhere and here it was. We thought that 9 months was enough to clean the container and I thought I saw some other entries on the log since last September. Maybe they did too much sampling and forgot to log the find. Anyway, we signed the log, washed our hands, and got on with the main purpose to come here. Try the White Chambercin. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QBJE_cave-vineyard

I wouldn't touch that thing wearing a spacesuit. Darn if it didn't smell like the inside of a wine cask. Thanks for an interesting experience. I suggest future cachers grab it with ice block tongs and Lysol. Hey guys just being facetious.A good rain and it will be ready to find.I plan on signing log next time I get up that way.

DelicateFlower & Tim	Found it	5/5/2019	This is our first EC in Missouri. We walked up the path and then off the path to the cave. It was muddy in places but we made it without slip sliding away. A young mom and her son followed us. We explained about geocaching and she was very interested. She tried to put the app on her phone but the internet was found. We pointed to where Tim placed the thermometer. The 10 minutes went by fast talking to her. Tim went back to pick up thermometer and told me degrees. We then went back down to our car which was parked by the answers we needed to complete your EC. I collected the data and then we went to find a cache nearby. Thanks "bennet" for creating this interesting EC! Favorite!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
ROAD KILL!	Found it	12/8/2018	I love visiting big caves such as Cliff Cave. Unfortunately, some folks in the recent past don't have the same appreciation and now the public cannot get any deeper than the mouth. Still, the area surrounding the cave is a great place to spend time enjoying the outdoors. Thanks for bringing me here.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

The Weasel	Found it	10/15/2016	Out with Croling, C4!, and L7! aka "Team Freal" for a fun filled weekend at Geocoinfest. The weather was perfect for grabbing all sorts of smileys. We prepared well in advance solving puzzles and picking out caches we wanted to grab for this weekend. We completed a few geoarts, several puzzles, some WIG's, some multis, some letterboxes, and of course some tradtionals. In the end, we rounded up around 250 caches and some great stories along the way. Geocoinfest was a blast. I'm glad I left my wallet in the car otherwise I would have gone braoke buying coins. For the eartcaches and virtuals that were found that needed to have answers sent to the CO's, those have been sent by another member of our group. TFTC!!!

Smokey48	Found it	10/10/2016	OCW 1Sammy to celebrate Earthcache Day. This is the closest earthcache to by house and I had been saving it for when I needed a close by cache. Today was a nice cool day and I wanted to take a chunk more out of the park and introduce CC to !Sammy. Heading to the cache, we met Detering coming down with a friend and several kids. He told us his digital thermometer was acting up and he couldn't get reading so he joined us back to the cave. While waiting for the ten minutes, he regaled us with several interesting caching stories. TFTC, and all the cave background bennet. It's nice to know stuff but it still won't get me into any cave (bad Boy Scout caving experience). Answers sent and picture is with 1Sammy's log. I'm on the left side.

Reetaville	Found it	10/9/2016	Given this whole park is named after the cave, I expected signage leading to it to be prominent. Such is not the case. I did eventually find a trail and Had a pleasant walk out to the cave on a sunny crisp morning. There was not a perceptible temp difference because it was a cool morning. I'm in from Illinois visiting an old friend for the weekend. Lucky thing to have such a cool EC nearby as I was heading out of town.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
Detering	Found it	10/9/2016	OCW Nail, his kids and 3/4 of my kids. Our thermometer died on us on the way up to the cave. Luckily we ran into another group of cachers on the way back down to the parking lot, so we headed back to get our required temperature readings. Without an actual container to find the kids lost interest quickly and headed back to the parking lot with Nail. I stayed behind and swapped caching stories while we waited for the thermometer to settle. After taking all of the required measurements, photos and locating the proper information, we thankfully headed into the park to find "real" geocaches according to the kids.

PibAndPog	Found it	10/1/2016	Thanks found it with G and Geodoge. This was Geodoge's first visit to this park and my first visit to the cave portion of the park. Had rained the days previous so everything was slippery and a bit muddy so I was quite glad i had worn my hiking boots for the trek. We waded through some small creeks, walked over rocks and climbed up to see the cave entrance. Geodoge gave everything a good sniff. I took some pics. GEOffreyCACHE's scientific readings revealed that there was only a 2 degree difference between the ambient temperature and the cave temperature. 70° outside and 68° at the mouth of the cave. Thanks for the cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
GEOffreyCACHE	Found it	10/1/2016	In looking for somewhere pet-friendly to get some exercise this Saturday morning, I suggested Cliff Cave park because we visited it once years ago, but didn't see the cave, sticking instead to the river trail to the south and scoring our highest day of geocache finds ever. Today, I just wanted to make sure we got to the cave and since I had scouted the area beforehand, I knew I needed to bring a thermometer for the temperature reading as well. Unfortunately, the thermometer I had needed a new battery, so we made a special stop on the way go get that. It was pretty easy to find the answers for the questions, and it was a not-to-strenuous hike to the mouth of the cave. My scientific readings revealed that there was only a 2 degree difference between the ambient temperature and the cave temperature. 70° outside and 68° at the mouth of the cave. We had fun, took some pictures, and were glad as we crossed the slippery-stoned stream that we didn't wear flip-flops, like some others we saw did. It was a fun morning. My selfies didn't come out so well, but I'll post the best one. TFTFEC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

JanS03	Found it	6/15/2016	Doing some local caching with IBEW Ret. This was our first cache of the day. Just about the time we were ready to head for the cave the skies opened up and the rains came down. Rather than just wait for the rain to let up we placed the thermometer on the grass in front of the truck for the required amount of time. Soon after that the rain let up and we headed to the cave. There was just enough rain to make the mud slick. We made it OK tho, and took pictures while waiting for the thermometer to get a reading of the air temp coming from the cave. Then we continued to the interpretive display and got the required info from it. Thanks, Bennet, for a fun and interesting earthcache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

eravau	Found it	10/12/2014	(#2,700) Even though I love earthcaches… as can be seen by my 50+ finds… I had been putting off this one for a day where it would help meet some other requirement besides just a smiley. With today's souvenir available… I decided today was that day. On top of that… I wanted to make my 2,700th find something besides a typical find… so that made this an even better candidate for today's outing. So I drove almost an hour to the trailhead and then made the short hike through the shallow stream that was flowing today… in the light, misty rain. I gathered the requested info and took a few pictures before making the drive back. I got back [b]almost[/b] in time… but missed half of the first song of my daughter's choir concert. But I'm happy that I had time to spend a little while in the woods today… rain or no rain. Thanks for maintaining this cache, bennet!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

We got this one along with many others while on a run in the Cahokia/Dupo/Columbia area on a beautiful summer day. We needed to hit wally's for some wine so we figured we would grab a few in JB park. We have been here a couple times caching in the past year, I think we got most of them between all the trips here. She sent in the answers last time when she logged it.

This is a neat place to visit, and kind of "cool" that there is such a significant temperature drop outside the cave. If it wasn't for caching we would have never found this place.

korriaan	Found it	7/2/2014	Had a great day caching in Cliff Cave park with RobCyn and magpie27 (even if I did get some chigger bites from bushwacking). Finished off the day with a visit to the cave for this earthcache. We had fun looking at the cave and taking pictures around the area. We decided to have my little TB Marty the Minion get in on things too. He's such a great little helper...	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

David	Found it	5/25/2014	11:27am #31604. Eggsilent4 and I took a 5 day, 8 state tour with a visit to GeoWoodstock XII in St. Charles, Missouri right in the middle. We stamped most logs as Team LaB! ([b]L[/b]ike [b]a[/b] [b]B[/b]oss[b]![/b]), while some were signed individually. The posted coords for the EC were on the way to the oldie traditional, and preparations have been made just in case. Caves are awesome. Didn’t see any bodies dumped here by the mafia. My answers have been emailed. Thank you for placing caches for us to find and enjoy.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
EggSilent4	Found it	5/25/2014	I joined with David for a 2000 mile circular trip to GWXII and back. We had a great time and enjoyed many cache finds. Already looking forward to next year! We walked past the cave on the way to the oldie up the hill. Then we made the short drive to get the rest of the needed information to put a bow on this one. Email and photo.

Nicooole	Found it	5/23/2014	Love a good Earthcache and this did not disappoint. We made the trek up to the cave entrance and spent sometime just checking this out. The walk up was fun to kind of follow the creek up. After doing what we needed to do here we made the climb up the hill there probably was an easier way but I don't do that apparently and when I got back there were people in the cave cleaning up the graffiti in the area. Thanks for the EarthCache. Email has been sent.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
royalsfan	Found it	5/23/2014	We were in the area for another cache and of course we couldn't pass up an EC. There were some kind souls getting rid of the graffiti at gz. Nicooole loves her EC's.

jennystalin	Write note	5/6/2014	Did this hike (the upper trail) last Saturday.

Mesozoic	Found it	5/1/2014	Awesome earthcache, Thanks. Brook, Be still,—be still! Midnight’s arch is broken In thy ceaseless ripples. Dark and cold below them Runs the troubled water,— Only on its bosom, Shimmering and trembling, Doth the glinted star-shine Sparkle and cease. Life, Be still,—be still! Boundless truth is shattered On thy hurrying current. Rest, with face uplifted, Calm, serenely quiet; Drink the deathless beauty— Thrills of love and wonder Sinking, shining, star-like; Till the mirrored heaven Hollow down within thee Holy deeps unfathomed, Where far thoughts go floating, And low voices wander Whispering peace.

Monk-E Arms	Found it	10/12/2012	asked my buddy olecollegetry if he wanted to head out today - he came up with your cache as a destination because of the use of the thermometer, so off we went. Trail a bit muddy from yesterday's rain, and saw some ladies walking their dogs which slightly interrupted our quest. Grabbed the Cliff Cave Traditional and then headed downhill to the final answers. A few hours later and we would have seen a wedding going on at the pavilion. Thanks for taking us up there.

TerriBikes+	Found it	9/3/2012	Today, my muggle hubby and I visited Cliff Cave in MO. and enjoyed the park, the hikes, the Mississippi River and CLIFF CAVE....and of course prepared for this EarthCache adventure. After 3 days of rain, the trail to the cave was very muddy and a bit slippery, and the water flowing out of the cave was relatively high and fast, which reminded me of the history you mentioned of the exploring students that died during a flash flood in the cave years ago. Being an old 'geologist' myself, I enjoyed the unique history of this cave and talked a little karst geology with my hubby and took pictures and explored around a bit while waiting for the temp reading. We had a good 10-15 mins alone at the cave until another hiker with 2 dogs happened up the trail. Afterwards, we spent some time by the MS river and hiked a little trail, grabbed a traditional cache and watched some younger sure-footed adventurers atop the bluff along the RR track....and then of course answered the Qs from the informative sign near the shelter. Thanks for getting us out after a rainy 3 days being cooped up at home. Nice day.

Email has been sent and I have a picture with myself and lrjameson's daughter, didn't think about getting one specifically of me at the cave so hope this works. We had a great time exploring this cave area and it was a nice cool break after a very hot hike in the woods looking for a cache earlier in the day. So pretty and peaceful here.

The Inkwell	Found it	3/16/2012	Spent a couple of days in town as a part of our geo-vacation and grabbed some caches here. We always love a good cave cache and had fun exploring this one. There was a pretty decent stream coming out of the cave today. Wish we could have gone inside, but we understand why it isn't allowed. The graffiti covering the walls inside is a perfect example of why the cave isn't open to the public; it's a shame really. Thank you so much for bringing us here. We really enjoyed the short hike, cave lesson and the cave itself. TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
Unitzoid	Found it	2/18/2012	Going Home #27 (12:45 PM) I exited the car and began a spirited sprint to Cliff Cave. A previous visit had lacked the questions necessary for completing this earthcache; however, this time I was prepared. Feeling a little winded from the run, the large mouth of the cave was approached as data started collecting. My investigations were interrupted by a family enjoying the trails of the park. The mother inquired if I was geocaching, and, after confirming our shared sport, I asked if she'd like to share in the data. She declined stating that they only participate sparingly when the weather is nicer. We talked for a short while and took each others photo near the entrance. Ways were parted briefly as I completed obtaining the necessary information. There is obviously quite a bit of history here; the channeled creek, wall and even statements of prior habitation make it a fascinating place to investigate! Perhaps one day the cave will reopen to public exploration. Walking back down the trail, I met up with one of the daughters who remarked that her family was weird. "What family isn't?" I thought. Her mother was attempting to walk down a steep incline without sliding in the leaves. I assisted and lent a hand to steady her descent. All was good, and I returned to the parking area to take another temperature reading. The next coordinates to visit were checked while waiting, and I mentally slapped myself for passing them up earlier. So, undaunted, I drove back and found a couple consulting the signs trying to figure out which trail to attempt. A previous bike ride along the paved loop provided information I could impart as to the area conditions. They thanked me for the help as I jotted down the last information required for the earthcache. Some more time was taken to read the signs before I eventually needed to head on to other adventures. Thanks for pointing out this interesting cave! The information requested should be on its way.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

tasmo	Found it	1/28/2012	OCW el-mo, LJFL, and CasonJFL, we headed to this great earthcache after playing a bit of Clue in Jefferson Barracks park. We parked and made our way up the path to the entrance of the cave. We were rewarded on our way by a flowing stream and a few small waterfalls from the water flowing from the cave. We got to the cave entrance, where we were greeted by the signs warning us of all sorts of bad things to befall us if we were to enter (which we did not!). We made some field tests and took some photos. The kids love caves, and this one was no exception. We headed back to the car, and drove to the other location specified in the cache description. We quickly found the other information needed, noted it, and headed off to our next cache. Thank you, bennet, for bringing us to a park we'd never been to, to a site the kids loved, and for placing this earthcache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

OzarksJim	Found it	7/6/2009	Find # 1797 and 7th find of the morning. This was my first trip to this parking lot and area of the Bois D'Arc CA since "the incident" in April 2008 when I was nearly shot by the crazy neighbor who lives in the house just west of here, and became a suspect (at least for about an hour) of the Greene County sheriff's department because they thought I committed some heinous crime (instead of coming here at night for an FTF), of which I have since learned there was more to the story that night, and I need to get in touch with Gredeman about since he has all the juicy details, I'm told. Anyway, I thought about that night a lot while I was here finding the three caches in this area. I walked past the cave a couple times because the undergrowth was so thick, but eventually after some bushwhacking I got to the right area. The tree cover caused me to look in all the wrong places, but eventually got me to the right spot and I found the cache. Signed logbook. I then went over to the cave and took some pictures, including one of myself for the waymark that is here. Thanks for the cache! ~OzarksJim - Willard, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1RBYY_bdca-permit-cave

DaKender	Found it	5/16/2009	#415 Well, will make a short story long here.... Got the notification yesterday, but as you would know, things were up, had to move a couch for my mom, and after that had to head to the store to go shopping with the wife. After that, buddy from OKC called and said "IM HERE" heheh, OUCH, so ran out to moms house to see him, then ran home QUICK cause we were on the bike... By that time it was around 11pm and was tired, figured the gang had already snaged them so just went to bed. Bright and early this morning, buddy called and had to go help him unload my stove out of his truck and into my storage unit...... (Thinking, I'm never Gonna Get A Cache Today). Got it done and wow, they were done with me, so at that point, I headed to the BDCA newbies. But as luck would have it, YOU KNOW WHO...... hehehehehe, beat me to them by 2 hours. Great fun being back here in the area. TFTC, TNLNSL.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1RBYY_bdca-permit-cave
phenixcachers	Found it	5/16/2009	FTF # 77 @ 8:30 am. Like wow, man!----I couldnt believe that none of the FTF gang had slipped out here last night under the cover of darkness after the meet-n-greet. Or if not then, at the crack of dawn this morning. Well not knowing if anyone had been out here either times, I blazed a caching trail out there and the instant my geo-foot hit the geo-trail, I was off and running (literally, and at full speed too)---to ground zero in "full geocaching FTF excitement"..haha. Found the cache easily and about fell over in both shock and excitment when I seen the fresh, new blank log..haha Very neat area there by the cave and the cave itself looked neat too. Man, it sure was exciting for me to be able to once again cache in the bdca. I've missed it and missed caching out here since the big "cache stealing-palooza" went on out here. Hopefully since you have permits and permission from Kevin, these 3 new ones will be safe and will be here for years to come for cachers to enjoy. I just wish they would allow more than 3 caches on conservation areas..haha. But 3 is better than none--especially out here in the good ole bdca! I've always enjoyed your caches and have always been a big fan of them. Thanks a bunch good buddy for placing these caches and getting the permits and permission. Cache on my friend...

Mongo	Archive	4/28/2013	[b][u][red]ARCHIVING CACHE[/b][/u][/red] No response from cache owner. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time I don’t think we can do so any longer. Therefore, I have archived this cache. If you haven’t done so already, please pick up any remaining cache bits as soon as possible. When repairs to this cache are completed, and it is time to have it listed once again it will be no problem as long as it still meets the guidelines. Just drop me a note( by email at Mongo@geocachingadmin.com) and let me know the GC waypoint number of the cache or better yet, the URL of the cache page. You will still be able to access your cache page just as before by going to your “My Cache Page” and clicking the link of your cache. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

chuck80196	Needs Maintenance	3/14/2013	OCW Shoney1. I was closing in on find #3,000 so Shoney and I made plans to travel to the Carthage/Joplin area to reach my milestone. I reached 2,999 on Wednesday so today was the day! As we made our way to the "Crap Duster" cache which was to be my 3,000th find, Shoney told me he needed 13 finds to reach 4,900. Our plan was set! We had to score at least 14 smileys today. Shoney couldn't live with 13 finds as he has triskaidekaphobia, the fear of 13. LOL! I ended up with 17 and Shoney had 16 finds on the day so we both made our milestones. It was a great day! We enjoyed the walk but pretty sure this is gone and needs a replacement. We gave it a good look using the hint. This hasn't been found in over a year. L2$AD! T4t$!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1RVF4_nature-cache-cave

The cliff dwellings were very neat, and it was also neat looking at the guaging station at the top of one of them as well. We came upon a geocaching family, they had been searching for a little bit. They seemed to have been focused on one area. We looked at the hint, and I was able to make the find right away.

leanmarine	Found it	2/28/2010	Funny story about this one. Instead of taking the trail, my daughter and I decided to follow the road because that was the general direction the gps was pointing at. We got within 30 ft from the road, then turned to the right and almost stepped off the cliff. It was about a 30 ft drop to the trail below. Feeling adventurous, I decided to do some rock climbing while my daughter sat safely at the top. I'm proud to say that I didn't break my neck, but I did loose my pen in the climb. Found the cache but didn't sign. I know I shouldn't call it, but seeing as I won't be in the area again, I'm going to. Really funny thing is 100 ft further down the path, I was able to walk up the hill without climbing any rocks. Live and Learn. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1RVF4_nature-cache-cave
MoSoGeoHeads	Found it	2/24/2010	We passed several spots, at first glance, they all looked like caves. Rough terrain, be prepared to hike.

The coordinates must be off, but still using the hint, we weren't able to find the box. Nighttime was closing in on us and without any flashlights, we weren't able to come up with anything.

We had to wait for some muggle-kids to leave the area before zeroing in on the cache, which was another quick find. Scott signed the logbook for both of us. It was getting late in the afternoon so we decided to skip any other caches we hadn't found in the area. I might be back here someday with my 4-year old son. I think he would find this place really cool. Thanks for the great cache. ~OzarksJim - Willard, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1RVF4_nature-cache-cave

DareGuy	Found it	6/12/2009	This cache drove us a little crazy for about 20 minutes or so. Our GPSr led us to an area that, in our minds, met the general description (lots of big rocks in front of what appearred to be a cave entrance...even had a match to the clue here), We did some looking, and some climbing with no luck. ParaPro realized the actual cave was about 108 feet further ESE down the trail (based on the readings we took at the actual cave entrance: N37 01.413 W94 31.044). We were able to successfully make the find after this realization. TFTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1RVF4_nature-cache-cave

Earthcaches are always a refreshing change of pace. They give us a chance to sit back, relax, and learn something new about something we never would have noticed otherwise. This cache was no exception who would have expected there to be a cave in such a normal-looking park? Back when this was a bit less public, this cave would have been a wonderful place to go during the summer to cool down.

Flamingo4ever	Found it	5/30/2019	I picked this up the other day coming back from Geowoodstock with my sister breezy406. Day 1 of my epic, exciting, adventurous trip with my sister breeze406 and without our muggle husbands. We are heading to Ft. Worth for Geowoodstock! It's a first for both of us. Our six hour drive only took us ten hours. We cached through two tornado warnings, flash flood warnings and severe thunder warnings. We pushed through it all and kept on caching. After taking all day to get to Oklahoma City, we head to Tinker Airforce Base to check in. It so nice to see a shower and bed after a long day of traveling and caching. Day 2 - We spent the night at Tinker Airforce Base. My sister is married to a retired military and it's a perk for inexpensive lodging. After checking out she stopped so I could visit the virtual here. We coached in OK a bit before heading to Ft. Worth. Do you know has at least two of the caches I have ever been to? Infernal Device and A Series of Unfortunate Caches #2. We will be back to OK City for a night when we come back for more. If we don't sign our full name we will sign F4E and bz406. Hello Ft. Worth, let Geowoodstock begin, the "Sisters" have arrived. Day 3 - Another fantastic day Geocaching. Traditional, events, letterboxes and more. We used a ladder today, stooped and felt blindly. Some we signed our full name and some we signed F4E and bz406. We went to the Stockyards too. That was really cool. Day 4 - This is it. This is what we traveled so far! GEOWOODSTOCK has arrived. We are continuing to find caches as we go. We have so many still to log. Thank you to all who put this wonderful event together. Thank you, thank you. Day 5 - It's time to head home but before we do, we have a few more things to do here and along the way. I want to thank you for bringing this Geocache to our Geocaching community and maintaining it. Cache on my friends and back to the cache mobile.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1V230_giboney-cave

CherokeeSarah	Found it	5/29/2019	No rain yet, so we decided to get off the interstate and check this Earthcache out. Nice area. Day eight and final day (hopefully) of happybobodog’s and my grand adventure heading toward Fort Worth, Texas to GeoWoodstock and home again. We had fun meeting up with friends. Today we are heading back home in earnest. We wore ourselves out on Monday. Along the way we planned on getting additional counties and see what interesting caches and places we can find. We’ve been able to get 24 new counties. We finished all the counties in Illinois picked up more in Texas and Oklahoma. We are not planning to get anymore because we are ready to be back home. Our total US counties now total 1343. We enjoyed doing the Adventure Maze on Saturday. This will be a new icon for us. We were able to get 11 different icons on Saturday as well. The most I have been able to get before was nine. One of my latest goals is to try and get a minimum of 26 finds on each of my calendar days. Last year I was able to get at least 11 on each day and before that I had 3. After 26 the next time the color changes on the calendar is 101. I have heard there are Challenge caches out there for these goals but have not found one yet. Oh my!🙄 Today is day number #1446 of my geostreak. I guess I will try and keep it going to the 4 year mark since I have already gone this far. It is tougher to do back in Indiana because there are not so many caches to find and many of them are mine. Thank you for the hides and all you do for the game.😊	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1V230_giboney-cave

FurfacesLL	Found it	5/18/2018	Hi from Australia. Our goal for this trip was to find challenges, virtual's, webcams and earthcaches as we meandered across the USA starting in Reno on our journey to Geowoodstock in Cincinnati. We have had a ball and seen some really interesting stuff. We had a great time seeing the sights and finding the caches and look forward to our next trip. What an awesome park and earthcache. We collected the information and have emailed our answers. Thanks for keeping us entertained on our journey across the USA.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1V230_giboney-cave
Sally Sedona	Found it	5/18/2018	What a lovely park in Springfield!

This one was close by to the wifey's old college that she attended. So, since she had visited this park many times, several years ago, we just had to stop here. Note that the thermometer is missing, but we got the temperature another way. Wifey (dfay1165) sent the answers in for both of us earlier today.

This looked like an interesting diversion and it was an extremely pleasant and straightforward stop for us. The location is beautiful and it's a shame we didn't have longer to explore.

kimbotjr	Found it	1/9/2016	While visiting family in the Springfield area, I was able to allocate part of today to stopping at a few more of the area's caches. I generally focused on puzzle caches that we had been able to solve and some higher terrain caches. With snow falling and a sub-freezing wind chill, the day was less than ideal for a high volume of finds, but I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to add at least a few good caches to our find list. This was 1 of 5 earthcaches visited during the day, which together highlighted some interesting things. Email with required information has been sent. Thanks for placing.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1V230_giboney-cave

It was amazing how much water was flowing out of the cave and how much appeared to be standing on the floor of the cave after all of the recent rain! I was glad to be wearing waterproof hiking boots. Otherwise my feet would have been very wet from all of the water flowing down the walkway. Thanks for creating and maintaining this Earthcache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1V230_giboney-cave

Scout's Mix	Found it	11/22/2015	Came for the EC today, and to finish cleaning up the caches I've missed in the area--it was so cold this morning that I rather enjoyed the warmth of the cave opening. I found the thermometer in the water inside the cave, and reached through the gate to pull it out of the water and perch it on the wall ledge just inside the gate. Probably shouldn't have done that...but too late now. Not sure it was super accurate as I would have pegged the water as being colder than the air, but maybe I was wrong--the water wasn't as cold as I had thought it would be when I reached in. Anyway, thanks so much for the cache! This is another Springfield park I would have never known existed without geocaching.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1V230_giboney-cave

This one was close so we made the quick run over to GZ to collect the needed information. Too bad we couldn't hang around for another hour or so or we could have participated in the tour and cave classroom event sponsored by the Springfield Parks department.

FLLibraryChix	Found it	8/7/2015	I grew up in Springfield and this was so cool to do on a trip back home 50 years later. We took swim lessons here, rode the Wild Mouse, learned to roller skate, watched fireworks and had many picnics. And we always yearned to explore the cave which was off-limits. We'd stand in the cool opening and peer into the darkness. The thermometer has been taken off its post and is laying on the concrete wall. See my photo. It's impossible to read to get the temp. The other answer will be sent.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1V230_giboney-cave

bearfeet1986	Found it	7/31/2015	This was a great find!!! I actually found it in May when I was visiting my bro in law in bolivar, but I have saved it till now for the summer road trip souvenirs. I wasn't able to get a temperature reading because the thermometer was laying on a ledge behind a locked gate entrance to the cave. I will email you the answer to the visitor who hung out in the cave. My two boys had a blast running in and out of the accessible cave area and throwing rocks and leaves in the freezing cold water in the creek at the entrance!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1V230_giboney-cave
MMaru	Found it	7/31/2015	Whoohoo, what a great day out geocaching! I'd meant to hit these caches as soon as I got out of work at 7am to try and beat the heat, but I'd left my hiking boots at home and did not think that my work heels would do me any favors in my caching quests today. I've never been to this park before, but I love exploring caves. I loved how this one is kinda tucked back a bit - definitely gave me a nice sense of quiet and privacy even though there were plenty of other people enjoying the park today!

scienceteacher42	Found it	7/25/2015	A local Girl Scout troop needed an "expert" to teach them to geocache and they got me since others were busy. We all agreed that Doling Park was a great location to start so we discussed a details and started with this Earthcache. The troop leader took a group photo and will submit the requirement.

So I made some pocket queries and loaded up the gps' and we left early this morning. We mainly headed for the caches with high favorite points since we didn't have a lot of time to research all the area has to offer. We got 43 caches in about 24 hours in the area. Lots of great ones and we had a lot of fun. We had a great visit to this park and got all but one of the caches. This is a very cool spot and we got the needed info which has been sent.

TxVic	Found it	5/26/2014	I'd had quite a trip to Geowoodstock so far and was finally headed back home, caching along the way. When planning this trip, I had picked out a few strategically placed and special caches to get and this was one I didn't want to miss. Nuvi took me off the highway and right to the parking for this Earthcache. I got out and made the short walk to the GZ. I took lots of pictures, but since there are 227 pics posted, I don't see the need to add any of mine. I wished there had been a tour going on when I was there, I would have loved to explore it. As it was, I just took a selfie of myself as far into the cave as I could be and sent it on to some social media. The sound of the running water was very soothing. This is a very pretty park, and I certainly enjoyed stopping here. Email has been sent. TFTV!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1V230_giboney-cave

There were several caches selected for our visit including a number of EarthCaches. This was the first, and the ease of access was quite remarkable.

We had to go a little out of the way for some, so it ended up being a late night. What a great location for an earthcache. Mrs stlee lived in Springfield over 30 years ago & this was a new location to her. Thanks for bringing us here. This one gets a favorite point. Answer on the way.

With time to kill between lunch with my son and daughter in law and a little tailgate fun, my muggle husband and I ventured to this nice park to grab the caches and enjoy hiking the trails. The history and the geology are both quite interesting here. Seems like a little secret gem of nature among the concrete jungle that surrounds it. For the fun adventure, nice trail hikes, great photo ops, interesting history and fun geologic sights, I'm giving this one a favorite point. EC's are my favorite cache type too.

Inkin' logs, WKUP Got tired of all the humdrum local cachin' Town to town, signing here and there. Maybe staying put was just not meant to be, So we're up here hunting targeted cache smilies. Signing WKUP, in Kansas City ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This was the day that wb96bobwhite and I chose to find and log 100 non traditional geocaches! What and adventure with our pals UnDefinedCache and PrairieEarth! Thanks for the fun This was another nice little hike and a chance to stretch our legs. A young couple pointed the way for us and we got there with no trouble. We did not have measuring devices, but we did our best guesstimating and UDC sent in our answers.

wb96bobwhite	Found it	5/28/2017	KidWrangler and I have had a plan to head up to the Kansas City area and go after challenge caches and other non-traditionals. Our plan got iced out back in January so we postponed it until Memorial Day weekend. We invited UnDefinedCacher who graciously volunteered his four-wheel drive vehicle for this special trip, and met PrairieEarth who was able to join for much of the weekend. Today our goal was 100 non-traditional caches, and that turned out to be quite the challenge. After getting the nearby multi we headed over here. Interesting trip to GZ without much in the way of signage but a very nice waterfall at the end. And a nice place to cool off for a minute as the afternoon is getting hot. UnDefinedCacher sent answers for the group. Thanks for the earthcache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1VWQX_cave-spring-falls

BIG Mama K	Found it	6/26/2016	Nice little walk in this lovely park today. Nice easy trail not too far to the waterfall. Really not much flow today was really only water in the bottom of the waterfall. We did manage to get little water in cup but not much. Seemed like it took forever.

coolhipwithit	Found it	6/26/2016	I am logging this one because I was there on June 26th (it is now August 3rd) and I specifically remember fulfilling the earthcache requirements as well . I remember because Big Mama 'made' me go back up on the waterfall with a cup we found in the nearby garbage can to measure the fall of Cave Spring Falls! There wasn't much water on this June afternoon but I did hold the cup under the trickle while she timed it. Very neat area and one that I more-than-likely would not have known about otherwise. Thanks for bringing me here :-) Love earthcaches and the places they've brought me and the things I've learned!!! Coolhipwithit Harrison, oHIo P.S-We are on our way to Colorado and GeoWoodstock, one cache at a time . . .

TripCyclone	Write note	6/24/2016	I want to remind everyone that Earthcache guidelines do require that you complete the listed tasks and email me the answers. I have been seeing a string of logs come through where finders have not appeared to do any of the tasks and/or never emailed me the answers. I have been sending emails tonight. Some logs may be deleted soon depending on responses. I have not responded in a timely manner lately to logs on this cache. Please be aware that without an email, you will be contacted and at risk of log deletion if you are unable to prove completion of the task in a timely manner.

kcgreyhound	Found it	8/27/2015	Trying to snag another 2015 souvenir, I decided today was the day I did this. I'm embarrassed it took me so long to get here, because this was an amazing cache. The park, dainty in size, is packed with such awesome things to see. Today, it was pouring, and I made it in after some hefty storms. I think this affected the waterfall, as it was flowing rather quickly. I saw a family of deer, some frogs, rabbits, squirrels, all while being a football field away from Blue Ridge Blvd. Amazing. Thanks for bringing me here and learning a bit about this historic site. Favorite point from me!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1VWQX_cave-spring-falls

wanderfish	Found it	4/13/2015	In town visiting from Lawrence, KS and here for muggle life activities scheduled on Saturday night in Seymour we decided to make a geocaching weekend of it. Our plans for today are to cache our way from Columbia and start out the first half of the SFT geotrail while caching on the way back toward home. Woke up this morning at the normal work day time to get an early start. There's nothing we love more than caching in a new , unexplored neck of the woods! This cache was along the route of the SFGT hides we were after for today. So far we have found 6 on the SFGT. Well....Val forgot the bucket so when we arrived at GZ much improvising came into play....but doesn't that happen on so many finds?! We decided to combine CITO with solving the puzzle part of the cache and utilized a discarded used, wide mouth 44oz. foam cup to attempt to take a water volume measurement. Matt drew the short straw and had to take the slippery, treacherous descent....hopefully we were ballpark accurate with our antics. This marks our 15th find of the day around 12:45pm on a partly sunny, 65 degree April Monday afternoon. Thank you for our 3415th find	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1VWQX_cave-spring-falls

thoehn	Found it	11/3/2014	I am on a geocaching road trip with team Fam2Go finding the caches along the Santa Fe Trail. There was a trail cache at this location so we chose to walk the trails and do this earthcache as well. We walked the trails to see the cave then over to see the waterfall. It was very dry in this area and the water levels were very low. I liked walking into the cave since I had a flashlight with me. Attached is a photo of me in front of the waterfall area.

After getting to the falls I found it to be not a torrent by any means, but luckily being an Eagle Scout and an engineer, I was able to MacGyver something up for readings. I took three readings, but the first one seemed so far outtta' whack I discarded it! (Engineers like to do things like take measures in threes).

Tony Banks	Found it	8/2/2014	OCW Team SS (Souvenir SEEKERS) which included yoyoteacher, fearlessknits, and Arthur & Trillian. Yoyoteacher needed to make a trip to Kansas to upgrade her phone, so I offered to join her and maybe pick up a cache or two on the way. Before I knew it, we were joined by a couple of our friends, and it became a challenge to get all 7 souvenirs in a day. It got a little intense being all crammed in a little car for several hundred miles, but our spirits were lifted whenever we stopped for a cache. The walk to this cache, and around it was undoubtedly the best part. Early on, when we first started on the trail, a bug went for my face as they often do. I put my headphones on to defend against its attacks and the rest of the walk was peaceful. Once we got to the cache, we enjoyed climbing around it, and while the clumsy one flipped a large stone over by stepping on it the wrong way, nobody was hurt. Thanks for bringing us here. I would love to see it after heavy rain.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1VWQX_cave-spring-falls
fearlessknits	Found it	8/2/2014	Out caching with Team Souvenir Search! (Arthur of Arthur & Trillian, yoyoteacher, and Tony Banks) It seems our whole group is very fond of Earthcaches, as Arthur had a bit of trouble finding one that none of us had found yet. This one fit the bill, and was a great legstretch as well! If only I hadn't forgotten my phone back in the car... Beautiful walk. I think I'd like to come when the waterfall is flowing more. Arthur assembled the information and sent an email for the group. I really like the writeup, it certainly is educational. Thanks for bringing us to this geologically fascinating location!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1VWQX_cave-spring-falls

SEAM Smiley	Found it	2/15/2014	While this was a bit out of the way from where we were staying, the terms "cave" and "falls" got my attention so off we went for a bit of a hike. After driving for 5 hours and then standing at an outdoor rink watching hockey, it felt good to stretch our legs. We were disappointed that the falls were frozen but we enjoyed the area and the history lesson and also seeing the cave. Thanks for the EC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1VWQX_cave-spring-falls

bucknuts	Found it	8/25/2013	[blue]Back on the weekend of August 3rd...Hockabee, Debrajean and louinliberty came to Des Moines and while here convinced me that I needed to come to KC for the Picnic. My dilemma was that summer is my cycling season not caching. I told them I need to ride a lot of miles this month and so Lou was quick to say "Get Riding", so that is what I did for 3 weeks. Cycling over 600 miles just so I knew I could get my cycling goal and make this event too. So FishwomanIa aka Fishtales and I went down for the weekend. We took the new matchbox car called the Prius. I just learned this week that Fishtales sold the Jeep and got a Prius. So the Prius took its maiden caching voyage and the gas mileage is impressive. Several things I have learned about the Prius: If you synch your cell phone to the cars system you can immediately 'REJECT' calls when they come in. The car doesn't weigh enough to trip the sensors at stop lights so you sometimes have to cycle through a few times before you get a green light. It doesn't have the back lift gate sensor, I tried all weekend and it just wouldn't work. Because the car is lower than the Jeep the Stop lights seem higher and Fishtales doesn't always see them anymore. The number of RED Lights she ran was amazing. On the way to KC we got a FTF in Osceola and picked up Hockabee in Missouri. Well it didn't take long for me to hear one word over and over...[b]RECALCULATING [/b]. But sometimes the lady was nice when she said RECALCULATING, she would say PLEASE ever once in a while. Friday night we did a night cache and wowser it took us over 3 hours to get it done, then back to Liberty where Lou and Debrajean are guilty of overserving me. Next morning got up and went running on the cross country course for an FTF, then we did some strings of caches, challenges, virtuals, wherigo's, earthcaches and some target caches. Spent the whole day caching and then made it over to the Picnic. StealthRT was supposed to be delivering me a set of VECTOR pedals and he showed up empty handed. What a disaster that was. The PICNIC was my [b]25,000 [/b]find. I was FTF on the 'chicken' at the PICNIC as I was first in the food line. Speaking of chicken...FishwomanIa took 3 pieces. After the PICNIC, FishwomanIa and I joined up with Clubmud, Vulcan and BakerGeckos to do a couple of caches together. Then we separated from them and went to get our final cache of the day before heading back to Liberty for another night of being overserved. What was nice for me was that over the years, I've done some caching in the KC area, but it has mostly been in the Overland Park/Olathe area with the kids and soccer games. Back in the day was down in this area about 4 times a year and now that Jr and Buckette are out of club soccer, those trips have ceased. So I never really cached in North KC area so that was nice to see new places. So for the Virtuals and Earthcaches one of us will be sending the answers to you. Sometimes we signed logs either our full name or abbreviated FWIA/BN and sometimes we used KIM5 when we were together with others to save log room. I was able to deposit a few signature [red]bucknuts pencils [blue]in caches while in the area. Thanks for all the great caches-signed log	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1VWQX_cave-spring-falls
debrajean	Found it	8/20/2013	Visited this cache with louinliberty and fishwomanIA and it was about time. I can't believe we had this earthcache so near and we never got over here. The trail are pretty cool back in here also, even though it's an extremely hot day and we already used up a bunch of energy over in Independence. I've attached at pic of me taking a picture of FishwomanIA taking a picture of the falls! They weren't running very fast today. The email with our findings and request for a math assist have been sent. Thanks a lot for this cache, Tripcyclone. As always, it's great finding one of your caches.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1VWQX_cave-spring-falls

Unitzoid	Found it	3/31/2013	Four Years Later #15 (7:00 PM) After enjoying a delicious ice cream sandwich, I found myself at the park containing Cave Springs Falls. A small 2 cup container had been selected for the required measurement and easily fit in my geocaching bag. To take a bucket may arouse suspicion, I reasoned. It turns out that a geocacher with full gear also brings unwanted attention. A rather pleasant walk down a venerable network of pathways eventually brought me to a high point above the falls. A better place to descend was negotiated and measurements taken on site. Multiple readings were assessed as the waterfall itself was closely observed. Very cool! With photographs taken, I proceeded on to another nearby cache. Sunset was close, and there were ever so many more to find before the day ended! An e-mail containing the answers sought should be on its way.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1VWQX_cave-spring-falls

phenixcachers	Found it	7/23/2009	After a long, hard days work doing landscaping work at the Train house, me and my good buddy Train decided that we needed a little cachin' "play" time, so off we went to this one and the other new one from the brilliant caching mastermind of Sterling! But like he said, we thought we grabbed the necessary geo-tools and laid them in the front seat..haha Guess we had just too much geocachin' on our geo-brains and we un-knowingly left them back at the train house--on top of the lawn-mower which we needed to do a quick maintenace job on. We came armed and prepared this time. The instant we did the necessary feat that revealed the cache, I knew instantly what the "container" we. Had I not seen this same type set-up before "somewhere" (haha)--I wouldnt have spotted it so quickly nor would have known what to look for. Great job as usual, buddy! Thanks for another brilliant and ingenious hide method and "container"! Cache on my friend... Scott (phenixcachers)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1W34R_the-diamond-mine
train1904	Found it	7/23/2009	The report might best be titled "The Two Stooges get a Level 4 Geocache. Attempt 1. The story starts the day after the cache was released, when I visited the area alone, wandering around hopelessly for 20 minutes Attempt 2. Yesterday, Phenixcachers and I were on our way to Springfield to get a load of landscape mulch. We stopped in and scoped the area. I noted one thing that was different from the Sunday visit. However, we didn't have the right tools that might help. Attempt 3. We went to tramlaw and got some tools. Stopped at Sonic Happy Hour and went back to GZ. Tinkered around with it a bit and discovered that one of the tools we bought wasn't going to work. Attempt 4. Today, we had to go get more mulch, so we gathered up an assortment of tools and headed back to GZ. Upon arriving, there were two police cars writing tickets to folks just north of the stop light. A third one was parked just east using radar. In about 1 minute, the two that had been writing tickets turned around and parked at GZ waiting for radar guy to point out the next lawbreaker. We decided that we could not do what we needed to do with them sitting there so went on and got the mulch. Attempt 5. Had the load of mulch and stopped at GZ. No police around, so we went for the kill. PC asks, "where's the tools???" I say, "I thought you were sitting on them". So we spent the next 15 minutes looking for the tools and finally left, wondering where in the world those tools were. Halfway home, PC says, did we leave the tools on the lawn mower we had been working on? We had. Attempt 6. We had to go get a bolt for the lawn mower, giving us another trip to town. Stopped at GZ, parked in front of our target, put the hood of the truck up so it looked like we were working on the truck. Then every time the coast was clear we did a little work and before long we had done what we needed to do. At that point, I'm saying, "I don't see anything" and PC says "It's right there!!!!" I reply, "THAT is a cache??????????". Sure enough it was. We signed the tiny log and with new confidence headed out for another difficult one our trip to get the right bolt. Since I drive by this one every day, I HAD to get it or it was going to haunt me. Wow.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1W34R_the-diamond-mine
Gredgeman	Found it	7/20/2009	That is one tough hide, found a clue, well sort of but dismissed it, searched, went back to that area, investigated, dismissed it, called a previous finder to try and get a better clue, but she was just like me and wouldn't nudge anything of high value......good for her. Then searched some more and more. Thought about giving in for the day but went back at my best possible search area with geo-items from the truck and then scored the smiley. That camo is really good. Glad to get this one over with, I really wish I would have gone for it yesterday when whatever it was was easier with the FTF crowd. Just add this to your list of great cache hides.

mikelong_300	Found it	7/19/2009	Ftf #14 i guess its not a bad way to end a dissapointing night with a level 4 star find in under 30 seconds after hitting gz. took me about 20 min with it in my hand to figure out what it really was. I loved it !! I was so tired since it was 1:45 i might of left the ftf prize . I didnt even check i just wanted to sign the log then get to sleep. So if there was a prize.

train1904	Write note	7/19/2009	Checked emails first thing this morning and saw this notification so I decided to go over and check it out. Also thought some of the ftf'ers might be there. Anyway, I told my wife that I wanted to run over to attempt a new cache. She said fine until I told her that it was a Sterling level 4 cache. Her immediate comment was, "OH NO, that means you will come home in a bad mood." So I promised not to. I got to GZ at 7:30. This was a location where I had thought about placing a cache myself. Of course, I soon learned that GZ is in the middle of the parking area and the eight new diamonds are all 35 - 40 feet from GZ. I checked all 8 of them out, but figured it couldn't be that simple. It wasn't. I read and re-read the description, although that doesn't take long and really had no idea what I was looking for. So I gave up and came home, but tried not to be in a bad mood when I got here.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1W34R_the-diamond-mine

I parked nearby and had a pretty good hunch of what to seek. The geocache was in hand in a matter of moments. What an awesome spot to disguise a hide! I signed the log as per geocaching custom and replaced everything as found. Whew! Now perhaps I could finally set sights on returning home to Columbia.

*gln	Post Reviewer Note	7/3/2014	[b][red]VERY LITTLE TIME LEFT[/red][/b] Greetings, I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs. I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived on my next check of disabled caches which could be shortly. If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. From the guidelines... (visit link) "... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time, normally a few weeks , in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing." Thanks for your understanding. When you have made all repairs, please remember to post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute! Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published. Glenn "Seek quality, not quantity".

fearlessknits	Found it	10/13/2013	I've been wanting to find this one for some time. When I realized there was no way I'd get to Columbia before dark, I decided to just give in to fate, drive in the dark and get a couple of Rolla caches before the sun failed me. Like eravau, GZ found me in a grassy spot. I put away the Garmin and just started looking in a Likely Spot. That paid off quickly! I had the cache in hand and just had to be a bit stealthy as traffic nearby picked up. After signing the log and returning the cache to its proper place (cool thing, whatever it may be), I sat in my cache-car eating a sandwich and debating going after Just One More. You can guess the outcome of that mental conversation!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1WMDM_experimental-mine-cache

eravau	Found it	9/7/2013	(#1,924) I attended the nearby event today and as I was heading out from there to some place I needed to be elsewhere in town... I saw I was going to pass within just a few feet of this cache. How could I possibly resist stopping? I looked down at my GPS and followed the arrow to where it took me... the middle of the grassy shoulder along the road. There obviously wasn't anywhere to hide a regular-sized cache here in the middle of nothing. I gave up following the GPS and just went with my geosense. In short order... the cache was in hand... a little over 40 feet from where the GPS said it should be. I took nothing... but left my signature and one of my signature items. Thanks for this cache in a cool location, Chungaz!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1WMDM_experimental-mine-cache

*gln	Archive	10/7/2018	ARCHIVING CACHE Since you haven't repaired your cache I can only assume that your priorities have changed and you’ve gone in a different direction. While I feel that we should hold the location for you we can't do so forever. If you wish to repair/replace the cache sometime in the VERY near future, just contact us (by email), and assuming it meets the current guidelines, we'll be happy to unarchive it. Let me know if I can be of assistance in the future. Thanks, *gln, Mongo and Banjo-Boy Your Missouri Geocache Reviewers	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	7/30/2018	STATUS UPDATE or ###OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED### Greetings, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last few logs it appears that this cache may be in need of repair or at the very least, a checkup. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little look and TLC. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. Boring snip from the guidelines... CACHE MAINTENANCE "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the ”NEEDS MAINTENANCE” attribute is showing you will need to do the following. CACHES THAT NEED MAINTENANCE Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and may be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I will be looking forward to hearing back from you soon. In the meantime your cache has been disabled.

We looked for a good half hour to no avail. I'm worried it may be gone. I even tried down the cliff a ways even though other folks said it wasn't that hard to find. The presence of 2 separate campfire rings near GZ shows evidence of others using the area. I'll have to put a watch on this one to see if I just missed it somehow.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
sokrkx	Didn't find it	4/9/2017	I'm a little late logging my DNF but was intending to ensure it was actually missing at the next event I attended. I inquired and am pretty sure I was in the right location to have found it.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
violalizzard	Found it	3/18/2017	Given the nice weather, I was looking for an excuse to get out and explore. Saw these caches and decided to come check out this area since I hadn't been before.

summitdoc	Found it	4/26/2015	I was glad to get this older find, and thankful I paid attention to which area to park as I could have made it quite an extensive trek. I added a little more 'geo cover' bc it seems to be a little exposed and I would hate to lose an oldie. Lovely spring day! TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave

dphickey	Found it	10/26/2014	There was some discussion online on the cache as the container had been listed as muggled. Tony Banks, Arthur or Arthur and Triliian and I decided a rescue mission was needed to save this old cache. Discussions of meeting times and places were done and permission from the non-geo wife were agreed upon and received. Alas someone beat us to the mission and replaced the container. Still it was nice looking at the old log (it was soaked though and could use a drying out) but the new log was dry. I did replace the pill bag it was in as the one it had been in was torn. All in all a good start to a warm day. TFTC I took the pathtag that the cache rescuer placed in the cache and left a Michelin man TB.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
gnomecat	Found it	10/22/2014	Just got to my car after rescuing this cache. I brought a new container (ammo can), a new log and added one of my pathtags. Glad I could save an oldie plus I needed this placement date. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
Tony Banks	Found it	10/18/2014	Met up with Arthur & Trillian and DPHickey at the Home Depot. I'd been worried about the hike as I've been recovering from a cold and not feeling well. The hardest part of the cache was driving to the parking area. It was a very pleasant walk. Thanks to Gnomecat for replacing the container and leaving a cool pathtag behind. I called dibs, but let DPHickey take it when it was clear that he wanted it more than I. I didn't see the cave, so they must have moved it somewhere else. ;) It was wonderful discovering this area, and I look forward to exploring it further in the future.

caching crew's folks	Found it	10/16/2014	Batman 74 contacted me to see if I wanted to join them on an outing to the Columbia area to chase down a few oldies. It sounded like fun so I was happy to join them. This was one of the fun hides we found today although it could use a bit of TLC in the form of a new container. Thanks for placing it! CCF - Lee's Summit, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
batman74	Found it	10/16/2014	We parked at the campground and headed down the trail. We didn't take the most direct route to ground zero but we got there. We found the cache after a short search. Rather, we found the cache contents. There was no container. So whoever goes to find this cache next or whoever is maintaining it, please take a new container out there, probably ammo can size. It'd be nice to keep this oldie active. Thanks.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave

fearlessknits	Found it	2/24/2014	After some time spent on my own cache business, I still needed a cache to find for the calendar. With half a day free, a good walk seemed to be the best idea, and this seemed to fit the bill. Would it be the right choice? Indeed it was! Not a grand adventure, no disaster, just a beautiful day to ramble through the woods, see some sinkholes, and forget my pen (there's always something.). I did have my stamp, so my mark is there in the ol' logbook. I spent a bit of time looking through it and enjoying the view. Thanks so much for keeping this oldie going!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave

igruen	Found it	5/18/2013	Unbelievable, but true: We were at 3 Creeks with our boyscout troop and the boys were climbing around the rocks, when one of them dislodged the stone that hides the cache. Interesting enough the scout who did it, is an avid geocacher (aaaa75679aaaa) and knew right away what it was. Very nice cache! Thanks!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave

M 5	Found it	11/11/2012	Grabbed this old cache on the way out of town in the pouring rain. I think my 10 year old was scared I'd hurt myself going alone, so he poncho'd up and came with me. We took the wrong trail and had to backtrack/bushwhack, but we soon were on track and found the nice cache with no problems. Did stick around to explore for a cave, just signed the logbook, left some official M 5 swag and booked it back to the car. Thanks for the cache!!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave

roadbikermo	Found it	3/24/2012	Out caching on a soggy mid-March day. This was one fun find that I made much harder than it needed to be. After taking the long trail to get to GZ, I started looking in what I thought was the right area. But due to LOTS of cloud cover it was almost impossible to get a stable reading. After looking all over I finally chose to give up, but right as I started back I saw a possible cache location and decided to check it out. And there it was. After signing the log I replaced the cache and hid it a little harder than was found. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave

Atomic Falcon	Found it	9/3/2011	Time to find, car to cache = 6 minutes, 23 seconds I was getting pretty nervous wondering how far west I would have to go to get this one, but then I spotted it and breathed easy. I never spotted any caves, though. Cache was in good shape. I recovered a trackable (always a bonus) and will move it on to an upcoming event in NW Missouri.

benji55545	Write note	6/23/2011	I had another tick fall out of my jeans this morning when I turned them inside out, then I found another nymph crawling on me tonight. I think maybe I cleared out the woods for the next finder :D Definitely wearing insect repellent next time venture into the Columbia woods in summer... sigh.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
benji55545	Found it	6/22/2011	I really should have just tried to find this one after finding Turkey Creek. It looked about .9 miles away on my GPSr. Instead I returned to my car, only to find out I would need to drive 9 miles (!!!) to get to the suggested parking. Well, it's too late to turn back now. As I was in the final stretch of gravel road, a beagle popped out of a nearby house and starting running with my car and barking for about a half mile. He's a fast sucker! The hike in to the cache was shorter than expected. I made it even slightly shorter by taking a small shortcut through the woods. It looked like it had been a road or trail recently in the past, but has been abandoned. Found the cache quite easily in part because of the excellent coords. Left a travel bug. As I was signing my name I noticed a tiny tick nymph on me. I smiled at such a small insect and flicked it off. Well, just seconds later I felt something crawling up my leg. It was a big mamma jumbo tick! I not so playfully flicked this one off, too. I kept finding ticks on me for the REST OF THE NIGHT! Four more in total. I think they must have been sitting on my clothes, because I would check myself and be convinced there were no more ticks, only to feel another crawling on me an hour later. Sigh. Anyway, be careful out here.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave

jsmtech	Found it	3/13/2009	Really nice cache spot. Earlier this week I was in this conservation area searching for the Black Hole cache (which I never found after an exhausting hike) and I walked within 20 yards of this hide. I didn't realize it was here until later in the evening after I had returned home. So I had to come back today to find this one. Found Geocoin PCMCJ1.

Unitzoid	Write note	2/4/2008	Three Creeks Return (2:40 PM) I came back to this cache to lookup the date of my last visit since I never logged it on the website. It was another nice and oddly warm day in February. Spring can't be here already, can it? The cliffs in the second attached were my next stop (they are at coordinates N 38° 49.92, W 92° 17.45). There's a very nice view, and it's well worth the hike, but take care if you go. The first step off the edge is a very long one and the soil in the area is loose. There's a firepit for camping if you are so inclined. The Superman travel bug was taken out of this cache since the poor guy wasn't listed on the website. I will take him to another cache in the area for someone to find today.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave

57chevy	Write note	2/11/2007	Just FYI... the Cache is NOT in a cave, and no special gear is required. There is a great view from the cache area though. Cheers, and cache on!!! also.... if I'm in the area sometime, I'll keep an eye out for the bottle.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
caverdoc	Write note	2/11/2007	We parked in the nearby parking lot, south of the trail. The glaze ice was pretty gruesome. The cave is gated with access controlled by the Missouri Dept. of Natural Resources. PM me for more info on getting a permit for Hunter Cave. Terrain inside is 5/5! There is a water crawl about 100 feet long requiring almost total body submersion in parts. The water is very cold. The cave is subject to periodic flash flooding. Be sure you have a wetsuit or polypro/nylon oversuit to combat the water and cold. Doc K	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
thegoalieman	Write note	2/11/2007	Doc, Which route to/from the cache did you take? There are many viable options here.. Did you park at the nearby parking lot (a couple of hundred yards away at worst), or did you park at a different parking lot? (half a mile or more?) Any details would help. I'm a decently experienced hiker, a sorta experienced cacher, and a newbie spelunker, so obviously I hope to reach that region sometime again soon (It's about 30 min from here). Knowing most Missourians, I can tell you it's a decent chance the bottle will be found and placed... for you to find in the cache (as you didn't quite hope to find in your last visit. :) ) If I happen to find the bottle I'll trade you for advice on the terrain inside the cave- The more I know before going in the better. Would prefer not get stuck or break a limb with my average shoes. :) Good luck either way!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20CE_hunter-cave
caverdoc	Write note	2/10/2007	Went to Hunter Cave today with group of 6 cavers from MO and KS. Yikes, the glaze ice was tricky! Hardest part was trip back up the hill, lots of wipeouts. One of my buddies lost his green lexan water bottle down the east slope (cave side) of hill, if you find it please leave it near this cache with note for "Doc" and I'll retrieve it for him. When he went head-over-heels it shot out of his pack and we just watched it, sliding, down the hill. Nobody was interested in braving the ice we had managed to ascend to get it... BTW, we didn't try for the cache because of the spooky ice all over the ground. Will come back in warmer weather to bag this cache and (hopefully) get that water bottle!

Wet1Rod	Found it	9/3/2006	There we were, had just found the Turkey Creek Cache, and I was holding a printout for Hunter Cave. Consulted the trusty Garmin and it said less than a mile, a resounding "let's go for it" echoed thru the woods. GOTO was pressed and a straight line track was started. Well, the shortest distance between two points is not always the easiest. If you try this the way we did, make sure you have plenty of time and stamina. To top it off, when we finally arrived within feet of the cache, I was told I was standing on a snake!! Yes, i had been, after a 3 foot vertical jump, with a 2 foot horizontal leap, i looked back to see a Copperhead slithering across the rock I had been standing on. After a few expletives and a few minutes to gather my composure we did find the AMMO BOX (not tupperware) and SL, TN, LN.

thegoalieman	Found it	7/8/2006	Ahh, a nice muggy 80deg Saturday in MO, and I went out for my second pass at this. My first, Mother nature decided to get mad at me, and further munge my common sense by making me walk about 1mi down the trail hoping it'd loop back to the point my ___ ____ GPS read as correct (which was way down the slopes). At the bottom of the hill further down the trail, mother nature says "What, rain wasn't enough? let's try two close range lightning bolts!" Needless to say outtashape ol me did a ruck march up the hill to the parking lot (stopping at the "tourist" point to have a conversation with a box turtle enjoying the soak in the middle of the trail. He scared the bejesus outta me as I was just marching and he suddenly moved his head at the side of my vision. Hrmm, good times when you can talk to a turtle.) At any rate, the second journey (further encouraged by my first finds at http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=41aea5e4-b745-4238-b6ea-39ae62ce29c6 Painted http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=eb073df7-26ca-4e1d-97b0-c3015bc80979 Rock) found this a nice short hike from the southern parking lot, and a fun further journey (though trying for me) as I made the loop back around to the parking lot from the other direction (take the left trails as you get down to the creek crossing/water clearing with several choices.) You'll have a couple of good hills at you. You can actually see that trail on Google Maps I found out later!! http://maps.google.com/maps?q=n38+49.971%27+w92+17.563%27&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&ll=38.831735,-92.292039&spn=0.003803,0.010815&t=h&om=1 Is the top of the hill after the creek crossing. J&JEN did a good job hiding this cache, and the view (though hidden by branches) was pretty. A bit close to the heights for me, I'm no fan of 'em, however far from danger as you said.

This is a great area for exploring and it is practically in my backyard. Didn't get the Bonnie and Clyde reference until I read the other logs. Great hike. Cody dog enjoyed the creek.

Old Professor	Found it	4/4/2018	Made the trip to Columbia today with 'Funwalt & Birdie' for some caches a little off the beaten path. With a DNF by the previous cacher, I told the CO we were planning a trip and if we were unable to find the cache and it was missing would they be opposed to placing a new cache container. He agreed. We placed a new camouflaged container today with a smaller container inside with the new replacement log inside. T-Nothing /L- Smiley and a Path Tag.

Just looked at the coordinates for the revised multi-to-traditional, and realized that the posted coordinates are different from the ones in the description. That was our issue!!!

The log book was wet and had some water in the bag but the rest of the cache was dry?So I added a new log in a bag and as it did not have many tools, I left 6 new screwdrivers and took the CPU that was in the cache.

Outdoors Duo	Found it	8/15/2014	Am going to claim this cache. Found where the second set of coordinates were, but missing 3 North digits now. Not able to make out what they were. Something has erased those numbers. Walked the half mile down the road and then began bushwacking for over an hour. Using what we thought those 3 numbers might be. Hubby fell 3 times and scratched his arms something awful, was bleeding and black soot from burned brush on his pants. Anyway, the second set of coordinates need to be fixed or I wouldn't advise any one to try this one without them.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20X8C_mine-tool-exchange
PoohbearN97	Found it	4/15/2014	Found this one on our way home from Iowa headed to arkansas the 2 numbers in the north were missing but easy to figure out based on original coordinates. I was going to fill it in but couldn't find a sharpie.. Really beautiful little area aside from the big stinking pile of dead deer Ewwww... We were a little concerned as the area has been burned recently but the cache was in tact. We chose not to exchange anything and regret this now the items in the cache were junk and my husband being an industrial maintenance supervisor he brought some cool stuff so we didn't trade. Thinking now we should have left his tools to improve the cache maybe the next person to find can do this the fun in caching is making the find and also finding cool treasures inside not a bunch of broken junk but from now on I will leave something cool in an exchange cache even if there is nothing I want because that makes it fun and interesting for the next person... Happy cacheing!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC20X8C_mine-tool-exchange

dphickey	Found it	3/31/2012	I planned on doing some early morning caching this morning and this cache was on my list. After a slight change in plans when a new cache was published last night and getting a FTF, I made my way up to this area and started this search. When I first started caching I looked for stage one but had no clue what to look for as I had never done a multi before. Now I found stage one quickly and started the hike up the trail to stage two. I came across a very large wild turkey on the main trail and startled a rabbit once I was closer to GZ. When I arrived at GZ I found the log book in a baggy on the ground, and the cache in it's hiding place. The log was soaked so I pulled an empty notebook out of my bag and put it in a new baggie and signed it, placed it and the old log back in the cache and headed home. CO may want to visit this one and retrieve the old log and maybe check stage one as the coordinates were a bit difficult to read.

Russ and Dana	Found it	9/8/2019	Kayaking in a cave was the grand finale of our 37th anniversary celebration weekend! Brought our own kayaks and really enjoyed kayaking in a cave! We saw a blue morph butterfly at the entrance to the cave, but no bats. The water was a pearly light blue - very pretty! Though we have never kayaked the Current River, we were surprised at how fast it seemed today. It only took us 4 hrs and 5 min to float the 9 miles, and that was with one rest stop, extended cave exploration, and hitting a boulder on a class II rapid. Russ had (successfully) gone down the rapid before me and told me later how alarmed he felt when he first saw my paddle, then my seat cushion, then my koozie float by He retrieved all of them, then my hero came and retrieved me too I was banged up in a few places, but, praise the Lord, was able to get back in my kayak and paddle the rest. In the 7 years I have been kayaking, getting dumped out of it was a first for me. But it was a great day nonetheless! And we got to explore and kayak in a cave, so thanks so much for placing an Earthcache here!!

ScrapLadyS	Found it	6/9/2019	Next we started out on our hike (Spiritwolf922, Aunt Dot and I ) and at first it was easy but then we went up hill, down hill, over rocks, down dry and wet rocks, in gullies, through nettles and finally to the cave and was it beautiful. If I didn’t have Spiritwolf922 looking out for me, I would have probably ended up in the river because I was in aw. We took pictures, had a picnic, talked to some fishermen resting and headed back to the car. It was harder to get back then earlier because by then we were tired but we made it. Thanks for the wonderful site and Spiritwolf922 is sending in the answers for us.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
Aunt Dot	Found it	6/9/2019	I was excited when my niece, SpiritWolf922 invited me to go along with her and ScrapLadyS to do the Cave Spring on The Current River Earthcache along with the other earthcache and virtual nearby. In previous years I had done three D/T’s that were a 5/5. I forgot how hard it was walking on the narrow switchback trails or what seemed like to me walking in a gully. So after I had fallen a couple of times I was somewhat concerned that without phone service how we would be rescued. After walking two hours we made it to our destination, “Cave Spring on the Current” were we saw three fisherman relaxing in their canoes waiting for the fish to bite. Spiritwolf and ScrapLadyS walked closer to the cave, where I decided to stay back for safety reasons. After we ate some lunch and had taken a couple of pictures and a short rest, we started back for the car. I felt it was because of me that we were stopping often, but the other two were feeling the effects also. Asked if I would go again the answer would be yes. After all I am a geocacher. Thanks for the adventure. Giving this a favorite point. Spiritwolf922 is sending in the answers for us. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
spiritwolf922	Found it	6/9/2019	After completing the requirements for the Devil's Well virtual and earthcache at the trailhead, we read the informational sign about the trail to the Cave Spring. I took a photo of the map for reference since I didn't have cell service - although I had downloaded my cache list with full data prior to leaving St. Louis in the morning - just in case we had to navigate the old fashioned way if technology failed. The trail itself is a 4.5-mile loop with a couple of off-shoots, one leading to the cave and the other to the river. The trail is a narrow footpath, more a well-trodden, glorified deer trail, than what I might consider a 'trail', but this is a National Park natural area, so you won't find that mulch-covered, wide walkway here. While the CO noted that the hike is a lesser DT than the paddling, I find that at my age (and the ages of my companions) would disagree for the 'easier' DT from hiking. My group, consisting of myself, Aunt Dot and ScrapLadyS, range between 50-75, and we fully agree that our experience warranted the 5/5 DT over land. Along the way, we encountered four trees fallen over the trail; countless large, embedded rocks in the trail; very slippery, damp natural rock 'stairs'; and the pièce de résistance: about 400 feet of stinging nettle between us and the beach near the cave. We all had on long pants, so it shouldn't have been an issue, but the pants I was wearing were no match for the nettles; the sting penetrated the thin material on the way in and on the way out. Fortunately, Aunt Dot was carrying hand sanitizer, which took care of the sting once applied to the affected areas. We heard voices ahead while we were still about 1/10th of a mile away, and when we got to the beach, we saw their owners: three fishermen in canoes were resting in the shade of the cove just off the river's current. They greeted us and offered us beers, but we politely declined, citing our need to stay hydrated with the water we'd brought, so we could make the journey back. We chatted with them for a while as we made our observations at the cave and took photos. We then took a break to eat the lunch we'd brought along in our packs, then went back to the cave to take a couple more photos and bid the canoeists good journey, as they were setting off at the same time. Having rested up a little, we decided it was time to start back up the trail to the car. We'd taken it slow and steady to get to the cave and knew that it would likely be the same on the way back. It had taken a little over two hours to walk in and it was about the same... maybe a little longer... on the way back. We stopped several times on the way back, mostly leaning against trees for a break, because there are precious few places to sit. One of the best places is an area with large boulders next to the path, which kind of look like they were carved into low-backed chairs. We stopped here the longest on the return trip. The round trip to the cave was long and arduous for us, but I believe we all felt it was worth the 4.5 hour hike to have the opportunity to see this beautiful area. I'm not sure I'm up for another 5/5 cache any time soon, but I'm giving this one a well-deserved favorite point.

Loves_Nature	Found it	5/13/2018	I spent four nights in Eminence to explore some of the natural areas that I haven't got to visit it and taking this trail to see the cave along the Current River was one of them. It got hot quick for May so I didn't make the loop back, but took the same trail. Beautiful trail, also so two box turtles along the way.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
LifeIsGuud	Found it	5/2/2018	The wifey dropped me and my canoe off at Akers Ferry and I paddled down to Round Springs in 6 hours and stopping here was one of the highlights of the canoe trip. It was fun to explore the cave area on foot and then by boat. Paddled in as far as I could go before turning around and heading back down river. Thanks for the cache, a great experience. The only living beings I saw today were swallows and flowers. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
HikingSeal	Found it	4/18/2018	Had a nice hike up to the cave from Devils Well. It isn't until I'm now logging this that I understand why it's a 5 terrain cache. We got there and I scramble over to the cave mouth to check out what might be in the water. I was a little bummed not to come up with anything. Cache is still a nice way to mark our visit here.

OCCD	Found it	4/11/2018	Two months ago I thought about taking two days off to add Iowa to my cache statistics. The plan was threefold; get a new state, work on some D/T grid fillers, and hit 1000 Mystery finds. One state quickly became two states. Then a cacher mentioned this year's MOGA at a Meet n' Eat event. MOGA's not to far from Iowa. I added Nebraska to the plan. It's funny how one thing morphed into something else. Then I notice that I've never found more than four states in one day, even though I've driven through more than four states in a day. I started working on how to get five different types of caches in five different states in one day. Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa in one day. That's doable. Just when I thought I had a plan coming together I discover an EarthCache in Missouri. You might be asking yourself why are you looking for caches in Missouri when you're going to Iowa and Nebraska? Because I'm easily distracted. I noticed an EarthCache that sounded interesting and decided I wanted to add it to my trip. I enjoy EarthCaches, and I always learn something new by doing one. It's a science lesson that often includes a little mathematics. EarthCaches have taken me to buildings, fountains, cemeteries, rock formations, marshes, wetlands, vernal ponds, beaches, moraines, an alvar, sink holes, erratics, glacial grooves, artesian wells, waterfalls, confluences, gaging stations, a fault line, and the Continental Divide. When I was a child I wanted to be like John Francis Smith. Ranger Smith had the ultimate dream job; the opportunity to be outside and be a steward for the park. I'd be lying if I didn't say I secretly rooted for Yogi Bear in his quest for a pic-a-nic basket too. Who am I kidding I still watch cartoons and enjoy being outside. I think I read that Geocachers make up 0.04% of the total world population, then factoring in those that canoe or hike a distance for an EarthCache that percentage drops even lower putting me into a small group of individuals that found this place. A chance to be outside away from the hustle and bustle of normal day life, and discover a new area of the country is a prize in itself. My extended family and friends that have no clue what geocaching is and are mildly surprised by how I stumble across Old Chestnuts of Americana in my travels. Today's travels will add Missouri to my EarthCache finds that already include Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New York, Mississippi, Virginia, Texas, South & North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennesse, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. My geocaching plans change like the wind, but one thing I've always tried to do is grab an EarthCache if time permits.  Granted, with over 20,000 active EarthCaches around the world, and averaging just 24 finds a year I needn't worry about running out of one's to grab. Thanks for keeping this cache going. As always, answers to follow shortly. TFTC.

Kymma924	Found it	10/7/2017	I wanted to see this anyway, and I needed an earthcache today. Double win. ^_^ It was kind of drizzly, but it was my only chance before heading home. So I made the hike. I ended up going all the way around, instead of finding the slightly shorter route. It was a nice hike, though. Just hard enough that it was challenging, but not too steep or long that it wasn't fun. Should have brought water and a buddy for basic hiking safety, but didn't come with anyone and forgot about water. XD In any case, it worked out fine. The cave/spring was really cool to see.

chiquita's bunch	Found it	5/22/2017	Sorry for the late posting, life got in the way of geocaching again. We used to float the Current River with my husband's brother every summer, since it's been over a decade we figured it was time to revisit. Luckily we called beforehand and found out there had been record flooding a few weeks earlier but that things were in the process of getting back to normal. We weren't sure what we were going to find when we arrived at Pulltite campground but the crews had done an awesome job cleaning up, you would never have guessed that 10-15 feet of water had recently been covering our campsite. It had only reopened 2 days earlier so there were very few other campers making for a quiet & delightful time. The first day Carr's (great people, big shout out to driver Tom) canoe rental picked us up at our tent and drove us to Akers Ferry and then we floated back to our campsite. It was really incredible seeing all the downed trees along the banks and the debris left high in the trees. Once again, the park service had done an amazing job clearing the river of obstacles, there was only one spot that was a bit tricky because of a fallen sycamore. We only saw two other kayakers the entire time we were on the river, unfortunately they were right in front of us as we approached Cave Spring so we pulled over to the opposite bank and waited for them to finish exploring. After they paddled off we headed in, even though we've been here a few times before it's always super cool (in more ways than one). Thanks lonestarkayaker for setting up this earthcache, definitely deserving of a huge favorite vote.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
GZBound	Found it	1/24/2017	Hiked down to the cave today from Devil's well. I wasn't sure how far in you could get by foot, but we got all the way to the back of the cave easily. Such a beautiful experience. I definitely plan on returning in the future when it's warmer to explore this by water. Stayed at the new lodge in the new Echo Bluffs state park. Have found a new gem in the heart of Missouri. Definitely a favorite.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

Hadn't been on this section of the river in over 10 plus years. Had a wonderful time. It was a humid, overcast day and we had fog rolling off the river for much of our float, including the area near the cave. That was a fun aspect. Didn't bring my camera on the river, so no pictures.

myotis	Found it	7/15/2015	Since this is NOT a 5/5 by any stretch of the imagination, I thought about not logging it. Back in the day, a 5/5 was really hard, not really easy like this one. I remember the 5/5 I set up back in the day, it took 2 days and instead of having to guess how tall something was (that's a 5 difficulty??? it is a 1 difficulty) you had to do a bunch of stuff along the 18 mile hike. But o well, the spring was a really flowing (first time I ever saw it with brown water coming out of it. So it was really hard to get back into the cave. I think an accurate rating for this cache would be 2/1.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

adventuretrekker	Found it	6/22/2014	GP9/14 and myself met up with Scoutpaddle, GEO.JOE, his sister and nephew for a paddle on the Current River from Akers to Pulltite. I have been wanting to kayak the Current for some time and finally got the opportunity. Just got me a new kayak that was great on this water. The day started out a beautiful summer day. We paddled, swam and was having a great time and then the rains came. It was raining a steady rain by the time we got to the cave. The cave was a welcome break from the rain. We explored around and really enjoyed ourselves. By the time we were done exploring the sun was shining and the river had a mystic mist on it from the rain. We enjoyed the rest of our paddle as thunder was approaching closer and closer and got to the take-out mere seconds before the 2nd storm hit us. Overall it was a terrific day and we really look forward to going back again. Thanks so much for this EC and the opportunity to explore the cave.

GEO.JOE	Found it	6/22/2014	Paddled Akers to Pultite to get this cache. We had an amazing day of great clear water, the river was not crowded and we got caught in 2 storms. Yeah two storm. about 1/2 mile from the cave we paddled in the heaviest rain I have ever paddled in. By the time we got in the cave and I got my glasses dried off and put a way I looked out and it was sunny outside. We paddled in the fog after the cave and had beautiful skies until 1 mile from Pultite, Thunder started rolling and getting closer and closer as we paddled faster and faster. I was able to get to shore as the rain drops started. I grabbed my Kayak and headed to a shelter. I made it to the dry but friends were just pulling out of the river so back to the shore I went to help get kayaks out and within a minute we were all drenched to the bone, the wind picked up and we were huddled in the corner of the shelter and trying to catch our gear that was blowing away. Quite an adventure of a day. Thanks for the cache. GEO.JOE	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
JandJCounts	Found it	6/21/2014	What an awesome cache. Batcave canoeing style. Visiting Salem to build my mother a deck we were lucky enough to see all kinds of things over this fun filled weekend. Including releasing a rehabilitated Baird Owl. Great company on this float trip, Hightechillbilly and Family minus one. Alyssa the Kayaker, very cool. Got rained on slightly, but a tree actually made great cover for all of us. Very fun float trip, can't wait to do it again.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

kristianmatthews	Found it	5/3/2014	Awesome! If not for geocaching I would never know this existed. I started out at the Devil's Well and then performed the strenuous 4.8 mile roundtrip hike to the cave. My device showed 2.2 miles in and took me 33 minutes (I was moving pretty good, jogging any flat or downhill stretches for some extra PT) and it showed 2.6 miles back out the other side of the trail and took me 49 minutes. Although the return hike seemed a lot easier and was more gradual on the grades and slopes, I was a lot more tired at this point after a long day of hiking and geocaching and didn't do the jogging on the way back. Also note, when I was just leaving the cave I was still excited and thinking about the hike back to the car and some dinner and how far I was away from Fort Leonard Wood so late in the day, and missed the return trail at a fork in the grass. I followed the river trail to the left for about .25 a mile before turning around and going back to the cave and discovering the error of my ways. This added an extra half mile of exercise today, but that mileage is not included in the 4.8 miles the loop took and the 1hr22min of the hike. I have no idea how far that trail along the river may go...What an amazing hike and adventure with a beautiful reward in store at the bottom. I loved the hike and how you would go through various types of forest depending on what slope you were on and the distance to the river. The spring time blooming made it very pretty, the trail dotted with flowers of various colors and the white dogwoods shining through the woods. The cliffs at the bottom were very nice rising up from the jungle terrain near the river. Hope no one ever tries to go straight line distance to the cache. That last step before the cave would be fatal. The cave was really amazing and the water beautiful. Spent some time there exploring and enjoying the natural beauty and the wildlife that was in abundance. This will go down as one of my true favorite geocaches and hikes and will always be a fond memory, even if I was pretty darn wore out on the return hike back to Devil's Well. Awesome EarthCache and definitely worthy of the 5/5 rating. Thanks for showing me such an amazing place. This is why I got into this hobby/sport in the first place.

My brother in law told me this was a worthwhile earthcache to have on the list and it did not dissapoint quite a hike in but it was a great day for a hike and i enjoyed the area.

Deut31-8	Found it	10/30/2013	Aaaahh! My wife had a few extra vacation days and we decided a hike in the woods at this time of year would be a great way to use one of them, and we were right. We started off early and made little progress through St. Louis in the thick fog. We stopped in Eureka for breakfast and then sailed on to Devil's Well with little problems. With the rainy forecast we packed our rain gear in my back pack and the other essentials for a safe trip. (My son is an Eagle Scout and would have been proud of our preparation.) It was a great hike through the changing colors on the gravely path that was mostly covered with leaves. There were a few downed trees, but certainly no problems. We believe we heard a deer snorting at us at one point and kept our eyes peeled, but the only animal we saw on our trek was a chipmunk scurrying into his hole. The cave entrance was very peaceful and relaxing. We captured several images and a short video with our phones and went back up the trail. I'm looking forward to coming down here again with some of my geocaching friends some day. Thanks for setting this up for us!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
AR RStanton	Found it	10/3/2013	Well, the Government shutdown didn't stop us from enjoying several spots along the river including this one. I have to admit that we found another way down to the river other than by canoe or by a long hike. We were able to park just about a half mile away and were actually surprised to run into someone else that was down at the river fishing. We walked a somewhat overgrown path along the river and were soon at the cave/spring. It was nice to be able to stop by during the week with noone else around to bother us. We explored as much as we could and were glad that there was an EarthCache here or else this is somewhere that we would not known about. I'm sure when the leaves are turning that it is even more beautiful down there. Thanks for taking us down to such an interesting place.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

debrajean	Found it	9/23/2013	I'm traveling with byonke and louinliberty heading east and picking up a few select caches. This cache was on our target list. It was a beautiful day for a hike, maybe even a bit warm. It was good to be back in the woods of Missouri again after a hot summer. Email with the requested information has been sent in. The hike to this cache made my day. My fitbit said we climbed over 90 flights of stairs, meaning we went up 10 feet of elevation more then 90 times. We were a little tired after the hike, but C byonke had great recovery snacks. Thanks for maintaining this cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
LouinLiberty	Found it	9/23/2013	I was talking with cjhoffy and we made plans to do a cache on Wildcat Mountain. I started looking at the map for a route down here and found this cache and just knew I wanted to hike to it. It didn't take much convincing for debrajean and byonke to come along this trip. We had a great hike through the woods on good trails and really enjoyed seeing this cave. We even got to see a big old muskrat swimming here. We took some pictures, estimated our answers and made the hiked back. Thanks for the earth cache. Debrajean will send answers.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

Paddle	Found it	9/2/2013	My daughter and I put in at Baptist camp and paddled (actually floated) to Two rivers. We camped on the banks 3 nights, but were only moving a total of 15.68 hours. Wow what a beautiful place. I will upload pictures as soon as I can find the CD I downloaded them on. We were both amazed at the clarity of the river. We fished and took our time to enjoy the sheer beauty of this place. Next we paddled on down to Pulltite and enjoyed it as well. I have been paddling for over 25 years and have never enjoyed myself as much as this trip. Come on out to my neck of the water and I will treat you to some equally magnificent paddling in central and eastern KY. Thanks for bringing up here...

Forest-Ghost	Found it	7/20/2013	Been wanting to grab this cache for awhile. Tried to go several weekends ago but it was not meant to be. Yesterday the stars finally aligned and I brought my friend who ad really been wanting to go too. I had called the kayak rental company earlier in the week and they said they were all out so I decided to bring my own kayaks and we made the long hall. I have not been to this area in quite sometime and it has become alot more popular than I remember it. The day was quite an adventure we began the trip with a flip and we got in the cold water right off the bat. Luckily everything was sealed in dry bags so all the food was find. We made it down most of the river without any hitches. When we finally made it to the cave the clouds were really starting to roll in and we could hear thunder off in the distance. We made our way in and took pictures and enjoyed the cave. So cool! I would love to come back here with my underwater camera and take pictures. As we were leaving the cave the rain started to come down. We decided to make a hard paddle and try and get home as quickly as possible. Surprisingly we finished the last 5 miles in about 1.5 hours leaving at the Pulltite camp. With the water so high this year the river really is moving fast. If one wanted to you could probably do the whole float in about 3 hours. The last hour and a half was pretty interesting with constant thunder lightning and heavy rain all around us. To quote my friend when I asked if she was okay, "I'm having a great time! I just don't want to die." This cache was truly awesome and although I haven't done the hike I can't imagine doing it any other way. The float was a very fun and relaxing ride. Neither me or my friend are advanced paddlers and besides the one incident at the beginning we did fine. Thanks for this fun cache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute! [B][green]Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published.

*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	12/27/2012	Greetings cache owner, It appears that this cache is in need of repair and has been for a while now. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. Once you have made the repairs make sure you enable the cache again by writing an owners note. If the ”NEEDS MAINTENANCE” attribute is showing you will need to do the following. (visit link) If I do not hear from you within the next 30 days I will assume that it is abandoned and archive the cache. We need to work to maintain the good relationships we have with the parks in the area, and we cannot afford to let our caches turn into litter. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I do hope things get fixed up soon. Many thanks, *gln Groundspeak Reviewer [size=1][beige]#8ef612db36460001674ddaf787c9fa30[/beige][/size]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC24K4Z_captain-cave-man

Mongo	Archive	11/6/2012	[b][u][red]ARCHIVING CACHE[/b][/u][/red] No response from cache owner. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time I don’t think we can do so any longer. Therefore, I have archived this cache. If you haven’t done so already, please pick up any remaining cache bits as soon as possible. When repairs to this cache are completed, and it is time to have it listed once again it will be no problem as long as it still meets the guidelines. Just drop me a note( by email at Mongo@geocachingadmin.com) and let me know the GC waypoint number of the cache or better yet, the URL of the cache page. You will still be able to access your cache page just as before by going to your “My Cache Page” and clicking the link of your cache. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

*gln	Post Reviewer Note	10/14/2012	[b][green] ONE MONTH LEFT [/b][/green] Greetings, I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs. I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. [b] If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches. [/b] If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. From the guidelines... http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint "... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b] normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing." Thanks for your understanding. When you have made all repairs, please remember to post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute! [B][green]Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published. [/green][/b] Glenn "Seek quality, not quantity". Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is Glenn (*gln), Mongo & Banjo-Boy How to get your cache published quickly: http://tinyurl.com/yhnva3g If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b]log a note to the cache[/b] (not email) within the next 30 days so I don't archive the listing for non-communication.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC26QP3_the-bat-cave
Mongo	Temporarily Disable Listing	9/17/2012	[b][u][red]OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED[/b][/u][/red] Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last several logs on this cache it appears that this cache is in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the [red][b]”NEEDS MAINTENANCE”[/b][/red] attribute is showing you will need to do the following. http://tinyurl.com/y8n7vuy Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and will be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

serena_gale	Needs Archived	9/16/2012	I tried leaving a maintenance log over a month ago but, so far, this cache has not had any response from the CO. It hasn't been found since April and, as a previous finder, I can confirm that the cache is no longer there. I think this should be archived.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC26QP3_the-bat-cave

The object that it was hidden next to has been removed and presumably, so has the cache. It needs to be replaced and the coords updated or archived so someone else can place a cache in this park.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC26QP3_the-bat-cave

Maybe the CO needs to check to see if someone has done something funny here. THX GN&D	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC26QP3_the-bat-cave

*gln	Post Reviewer Note	4/13/2010	Congratulations, Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site . One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one guy here with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . Looks fun, Enjoy! Cheers & Thanks for your contributions to Geocaching, Glenn "Seek quality, not quantity".

Flamingo4ever	Found it	4/27/2018	Epic, fabulous day of all days! Now that the weather is starting to act a lot more like Spring, my sister Breezy406 and myself are back on our all day caching adventure. It is about time, it's been a very long, long winter. This was not one of these and seeks but it was one of our favorites of the day. I thought it was even better because it was my sister that had to retrieve it. Better her than me. It earns a favorite in my eyes because my sister Breezy406 had to go into the tree cave. We were at Shaw Nature Reserve last week but this week we decided to tackle all of the Wildwood Hide and Seek caches. Neither one of us had ever been to this park before. This was actually a fairly easy set of caches to do except for the Bluff Overlook cache, it was just a bit harder to get to. All of the caches were in great shape and gathered up chips at all of them. It pretty much took us all day and we through a nice lunch in there too. We got to the city hall about a half hour before they closed to cash in our chips and claim our prize. It was fabulous. A fabulous prize for a fabulous day. We weren't able to get all of the non hide and seek caches today so we will be back to gather them up on another day. I'm going to bring my muggle hubby back and we are going to bring our bikes. The weather was perfect and the wild flowers were beautiful. Thank you for bringing this series of caches to our geocaching community and maintaining it.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC274AD_tree-cave
Breezy406	Found it	4/26/2018	Out caching with my sister Flamingo4ever, on this beautiful April day. Our target was the Wildwood Hide and Seek caches with anything else we passed along the way. OH MY GOSH! As we arrived at GZ, I had not read the hint or all of the cache page, so I was quite surprised to find what we had to do. I can do this I said! 2 new knees I said! SURE!! I suited up and in I went. Linda kept my phone and hers handy in case the rangers needed to come and cut me out. I looked for a bit with no luck and was sure a snake was looking at me from one of the holes! Finally found it in a spot Im not sure was the correct one, but passed it out to my sister, she signed us in and I replaced as found. Now to get out! Definitely deserves a favorite with a higher D/T rating. All good at GZ, thanks for placing and maintaining. Update.... didn't need to be cut out!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC274AD_tree-cave

And while one giant arachnid I might've been able to attack, ha ha, when I noticed it's partner a few feet over that was it for me. No :-) for me as I hightailed it back to my bike on the trail. Iguess I'll come back in the winter when I'm dressed head to toe in clothing and armed with giant spider repellent or something, ha ha - thanks anyway - another day for me.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC274AD_tree-cave

spiritwolf922	Found it	5/15/2016	Out caching with Swelgus, Strider and How-D. We knew this one was missing and had obtained permission from the CO to replace it. Once there, I tried to squeeze in, and I might have made it, but I was scared that I might get stuck. Fortunately, How-D had no reservations and managed to maneuver inside to replace this one. It is where it should be and ready for future cachers to find. Thanks for placing the original at this location. It's a beautiful area and a lovely, unique tree. :) (Maybe I'll come back in about four pounds...) ;)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC274AD_tree-cave

zuze13	Didn't find it	5/8/2016	Out celebrating Mom's day with a walk and a few caches. This one is located in a great spot. I fit in the tree just fine and even though no flashlight I saw and felt numerous holes and niches that seemed like excellent places to put the cache yet came up empty handed...I didn't see or feel any nails like previous DNF cachers. I 'll try and keep an eye on this cache's logs to see if it is still there for a return trip.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC274AD_tree-cave

But with determination, I squeezed into cave as far as I could get and carefully looked all around. After a few minutes, I spotted it.

dana.marie.pants	Found it	4/4/2013	I'm not going to lie, I am glad all odds were against me the first time I searched for this cache. If I had found it, then today could have been less awesome. Not only did I remember the flashlight, but I wasn't pressed for time AND I brought a ten year old. The creek was crystal clear and rose to the base of the tree, so it made climbing in really fun. The view from inside the tree, looking up and out, was better than anything that even Tolkien has imagined. Even Chena Thunderbird was impressed, and he is a cynical trackable.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC274AD_tree-cave

Super excited to be headed towards Nebraska but can’t help ourselves grabbing caches on our way! Took a “slight” detour to chase this really neat looking cache! We were losing daylight but that didn’t stop us. Really glad we did because this cache was really neat! Would have loved to have explored this area! TFTC! And remember...cache to your hearts desire, no matter what others do, think, or say!! ❤️ MM12	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
nan-d1955	Found it	11/27/2017	On another adventurous road trip with Spiritwolf922. This trip is all about getting MINGO, 2 webcams, challenge, virtual, and Earthcaches, and other caches of opportunity along the way. In total, we drove almost 2200 miles in 4 days! I've passed this Earthcache many times, but since this trip was about grabbing more of those cache types, this was the time to stop and check out the cave. It didn't disappoint! All necessary answers have been submitted for both of us by Spiritwolf. Thanks to all the COs for placing and maintaining their caches and THANKS to my awesome navigator who gets us where we want to go. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
spiritwolf922	Found it	11/27/2017	Out caching with Nan-D1955 on a road trip that began the day after Thanksgiving and ended when we got back home late the following Monday afternoon. In all, we drove (well, she drove; I navigated) nearly 2200 miles from Missouri to Wyoming, picking up counties, virtuals, traditionals, earthcaches, a pair of webcams and challenges along the way. Though we started in the late morning of Friday, we made great time, and for the other days, we were up before the sun and didn't make it to our hotel until well after dark. We saw some amazing sights, visited some historic places, and had a blast! Thanks to my geopal, Nan, without whom I couldn't have experienced all these caches. Thanks to all the COs who placed and maintain the physical caches, and the COs who researched and developed the virtual, webcam and earthcaches. Without you, we never would have stopped there and discovered what you already knew was there. All answers to virtual and earthcaches have been submitted to the COs, on behalf of myself and Nan-D1955.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave

We were ready for a stop and an earthcache is perfect, besides I needed to stretch my legs!!! What a nice (and hidden) little park. Big Mama takes the quick way and I take the long way to the cave. It's a shame there is a gate and you can't go in|near the back of the cave but it is waaay bigger than I thought it was going to be. Love earthcaches and this was a must-do stop on our travels to Colorado. Big Mama to send the answers for both of us and I will send a few pics when(ever) I get them organized and downloaded?!?!

City Slicker	Found it	12/26/2014	Our intrepid team was passing through this area today. We were on our way home from Sedalia, Missouri, back to the Cincinnati, Ohio area. We loaded caches near our route, although I was the only one that brought my GPS. Luckily, I had loaded them on my in-car GPS as well and could see them coming up. I spotted this one on the radar and headed for it. We like earthcaches and will go out of our way for them. We made the trek to GZ and garnered the information we needed. I was the only one with a GPS, so my picture will have to suffice. As it was rainy, we spent minimal time at GZ and the others were back in the cachemobile as I was taking the pic. I sent the needed info to the CO to validate our visit. Thanks for the nice leg stretch and the earthcache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave

TerriBikes+	Found it	8/16/2014	Sooooo glad that Stacey (TFC) and I decided on our cache day trip even with the rains today. We drove from St Louis to finally get our "IconChallenge" cache and to try to complete our August souvenir challenge. Obviously we needed an EarthCache to accomplish that and this EC proved to be an awesome choice! As an ole geologist and spelunkers, this cache was right down my alley. I love all kinds of caves. The history related to this one makes it even more interesting. I'll email answers from a computer soon as I'm logging this on IPhone (rainy condition had the elevation readings varying so we took an average at ground level at GZ). Thanks for bringing us to this amazing and majestic natural wonder !! You get my favorite of the day!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
StaceyBassoon	Found it	8/16/2014	Found this on a day that was intent on ruining our plans with rain. OCW my pal TerriBikes+ with the goal of finishing the August challenges. We were successful!

4CeasonS	Found it	7/14/2014	What a beautiful park! We were surprised to be the only ones here! - Answers are primarily in my camera and will send them tomorrow night when I have internet next. We are on day 5 of our Cross-North America Journey. So far we have covered Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in Canada. Then we did Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Several of these states were first-time visits for us. We enjoyed beautiful sunshine for most of the trip but encountered 3 MAJOR thunderstorms. Wow! I've not experienced anything like that before. Thanks for putting out all of the great caches for us to find and showing us your great state!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave

North Coast Cacher	Found it	6/3/2014	Found/completed earthcache. Been wanting to accomplish this earthcache for a very long time now but, whenever I would be in the area, it would be dark. Finally arrived today in early morning just for this earthcache and to do some hiking. Mosquitoes convince me that hiking is out of the question. Made it to the cave, gathered required information, and run to vehicle because of the mosquitoes (must have been feeding time). Great area, will have to return another day just for the trails. E-mailed owner answers to questions.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
The Fat Cats	Found it	5/25/2014	Wow, what a great cave and area surrounding it! We really enjoyed the walk, even though we did keep picking up little hitchhikers...tiny caterpillars, we think, that were hanging off the trees and bushes. When we finished our hike and checked each other, I had over a dozen on me! We carefully got them off and placed them on nearby bushes. As for the cave, we loved it! We don't have the same geology in Southern California, so we don't have caves quite like these there. It's really amazing how many caves there are in this part of the US. I sent our answers (about 4 months late due to misplacing my notes) and I'll post a pic or two soon. Thanks so much for bringing us here!

fearlessknits	Found it	3/22/2014	Well, if I got the Mailbox, there's no way I'd miss the Earth Cache! One of my favorite icons to earn. The walk to it was beautiful. There were a couple families enjoying the picnic area and reading the informational signs.Tony Banks and I did the proper research then set to the more fun task of taking pictures and climbing to the top! He stated that it looked like a leprechaun got sick up there, the mosses were so bright green all over the place. I might have tried to put it more eloquently, but now leprechaun puke is the mental image that sticks in my head. Thanks for the EC. I will send the answers by email soon!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
Tony Banks	Found it	3/22/2014	OCW fearlessknits. We walked to this one all the way from the mailbox. It nearly killed me. I turned around and walked backwards for a while as to use the other less sore muscles in my legs, when she told me to turn around and look. Very cool. We walked in as far as the fence would allow us, and noticed all of the names written high above on the cave ceiling. It was one thing to have our pictures taken in front of the cave, but I wanted to be on top of it! I'm afraid of heights, and once when my back was turned to the precipice I had a momentary feeling of panic, even though I was nowhere near the edge. Thanks for bringing us to this spot!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
Rock Chalk	Found it	12/20/2013	We hadn't planned on going after this one. Rather, we were just going to get one of the traditional caches in the park as we made our way east from KC to St Louis. But this one was so close that we couldn't resist. And it was so cool to see the cave! No one else at the park today, so we had the place to ourselves, which was also cool. Spent some time exploring the area, took our pic, and off we went. Email has been sent with answers to CO. Thanks for a great Earthcache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
LadyCache	Found it	11/29/2013	Thanksgiving weekend trip! Decided to go after a couple geoart cache trails. Stopped for a few earthcaches along the way. This was a cool cave.

Thanks, N0WNV, for the time and effort in putting out this cache to add to our fun.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave

eravau	Found it	8/31/2013	(#1,889) Out caching on this fiery-hot last day of August with Pastor G. This was our first stop on our trip towards Columbia. I'm always a fan of earthcaches both because of the cool places they take me and the interesting information they pass along. This one was no exception. After taking note of the requisite info to answer the questions for the cache... we spent quite a little while taking pictures and looking around the area. I'm never especially anxious to leave an area like this. It was nice to look around inside... and then climb up to the top of the arch and gaze around the area. I can see why this area was used as a shelter for people over so many centuries, if not millennia.

TImHowardsPlaneteers	Found it	10/20/2012	This was a really interesting park which we stopped at en route to Elephant Rocks. The site, and this earthcache page, is chock full of interesting information. Since we are both archaeology students at Mizzou, it was interesting to see some of the department's history on display as well. In addition to the obvious archaeological importance, the formation of the cave was really interesting as well. Thanks a lot for taking us here. Our email will be on its way this afternoon, once I get access to the pictures. Thanks again for the earth cache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave

First one I looked in something looked back at me then backed back up in his little hole. Scared the snot out of me so I was a little leery of sticking my hand in any more niches. Jack's even more scared of snakes than I am and we'd already run into 2 today at another cache so he got a stick and went poking carefully. He then found a humungous wooly worm.

phenixcachers	Found it	10/9/2010	Was a perfect day to do a little cave exploring/spelunking, so thats what I did..haha. when I got to the gz area and seen what I was up against, I kinda gulped at the sight of all those smurf caves to explore...haha But shoot, I wasnt scared..I've always enjoyed caves and exploring 'em. So, I donned my caving helmet complete with a high powered light, and slipped on my caving kneepads in case i needed to crawl...haha) I then started exploring them there many/numerous smurf caves (all the while for some strange reason, that annoying "Smurf theme" was pounding in my head..haha (la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la.....haha) Searched several wrong caves, and thats when I started thinking like a geocache hider would think. Soon after that, I got lucky and scored the correct smurf cave. Great hide, buddy! I have always enjoyed coming to this area and this trail to cache.

After bosco7 and I searched in vain for a nearby mystery/puzzle cache, he and I came here for a quick find. We ran into a few geocachers that we hadn't met before and had a nice geo-chat. Bosco was the one who spotted the cache and he signed the logbook for me. Years ago, there used to be a cache at the top of this "cave" and it was one of my earliest finds back in June 2004.

A hard search for the cache and we came up with nothing. A PAF convinced us the cache might be gone so we went down the trail. We found a suitable container though that we later brought back and replaced the missingone. I hope that is ok. Thank you chuckswaggin, a favorite point for this location!

I’m still stuck on eastern time woke up at 5 o’clock this morning which is 6 o’clock back home 🤷🏻‍♂️ My name is Dave and I'm a cacheaholic , it all started when I was a young newbie 8 years ago I found my first geocache I thought it was stupid then I found a couple more and I said this is pretty neat ,now I find myself hanging off of cliffs walking through brambles and briars ,dangling from 200 foot high trees with total disregard for my safety or my life but you know what I'm free !!!

wanderfish	Found it	4/30/2018	On our last full (non-travel) day in the area we decided to try to clear out the rest of the geocaches we had left in this park. The last time we were here ....we kind of found ourselves with our pants caught around our ankles and weren't really prepared for the kind of strenuous hiking a jab at most of these caches might cost us. Though we had our hiking sticks and proper footwear, we had only brought a couple of water bottles. We didn't realize after finding a different cache that the famous 'Soldier Cave' cache was so close by. When we were last here we made a go for it and sadly, it was M.I.A. Today we avenged our previous DNF and finally we were able to log this notorious cache. I wish I could tell you We cleaned up all the rest of caches in the park. We got all but one.... the very last one on our way out of the park. We had to DNF, 'Tipped Over.' It made our stomach's turn to walk away without a smile face here but we spent a good 40 minutes on the hunt and came up empty handed. We know when its time to cry uncle.... Maybe next time? This was our first find of the day and our 5848th find overall. Thank you for adding to our 'Ernie-versary' weekend memories.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

I put both in a new 35 mm film canister I had with me, then rehid it among the roots. I went inside the cave to warmup, it felt much warmer in there, since the outside temp was about 16 degrees this morning.

Ms Sunshine	Found it	11/14/2017	I was here on a bus trip with the seniors, and this was the only day I could sneak away to do some hiking. I had been to this park 4 years ago and loved it, so even though it was a little damp, I ubered over. My goal was to avenge my DNF from years ago. I took the "short" way down, though my boots were soon caked in mud, so I doubt it was quicker. (I did take the stairway back up!) I thought this was going to be another DNF, when finally I found it. I wrestled with it for a good 5 minutes before was finally able to retrieve it and sign the log! I really enjoyed coming back to this area, and am happy to cross this one off mt list.

Geogeonut	Found it	10/25/2017	After bushwhacking from another cache (I know, I know) I wound up on the wrong trail. My GPS kept telling me to go downhill and it looked awfully steep. So I decided to keep walking and came upon the trail I was suppose to be on. Neat cave and story. I got to see a bald eagle on my way to the next cache. Awesome day to be out and about on the trails.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	10/10/2017	STATUS UPDATE NEEDED OR POSSIBLY OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last few logs on this cache it appears that this cache may be in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... CACHE MAINTENANCE "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the ”NEEDS MAINTENANCE” attribute is showing you will need to do the following. CACHES THAT NEED MAINTENANCE Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and may be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I will be looking forward to hearing back from you soon. In the meantime your cache has been disabled. Thanks for your understanding, Thanks, *gln, Mongo and Banjo-Boy Your Missouri Geocache Reviewers How to enable your geocache for further review.How to get your cache published quickly.Cache listing requirements can be found here.

wanderfish	Didn't find it	9/16/2017	We were camping at Cape Fair C.O.E. campground for the weekend for an RV show in Springfield on Sunday. The weather forecast for Saturday was clear and sunny and rainy for Sunday so we flipped flopped our plans and decided to use this day for geocaching. Boy are we glad we did. We had a wonderful time geocaching, flying by the seat of our pants - picking which cache to go to next as we went along, rather than having a planned out map of the day like we usually do. Val is finally starting to settle in and enjoy the journey as much as the destination.... must be the old age thing ;) The Sunday RV show turned out to be a huge disappointment. We left the show after only an hour then decided to take in a movie after that since it was raining. The movie was just as floppy as the RV show. So glad we paid attention to the weather and made the most of the one good weather day we had to save our long weekend mini-vacation. Originally we weren't planning on going for this cache. We had come to the area searching for an easier cache when Matt pulled up several others that were in the same park. Imagine our surprise when we discovered the legendary Soldier's Cave was one of them. We have known about this cache for years, and never felt prepared enough for it, physically anyway. We aren't in the best shape we have been in but we are in good enough shape we decided to go for it today. We discovered we are in better shape than we thought, but still want to be in better shape lol. It probably wasn't the smartest idea to go for this one with only a couple of water bottles between the two of us but we made it anyway ;) We were super disappointed to not find the cache here. As always it doesn't necessarily mean the cache isn't there. We have been bested by many a 1/1 - so we could have just been off. Sometimes you just can't see what is there. At any rate, after a seriously extensive search - we came up empty handed as many other previous cachers have as well. At least we can say we've been there and we will be back someday as we loved our camping spot in Cape Fair, and we left more than one cache un-found in the area that we want to come back for someday. We are putting this one on the watch list to see what happens... (and hopefully save our pride - to find it really was missing)... It is worth noting a very large pile of critter poo was at the base of said tree where gz was - we've had more than one cache get swiped by a critter or two.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

However, we did quite a bit of back and forth trying to figure out how to get down where we knew we needed to be. Which is why you should take the right path. (sigh) Met a sweet young couple newly married and new to the area. Decided they needed to know about geocaching and introduced them to the sport!

We had Cracker Barrel cater our Thanksgiving meal, which was surprisingly good. While everyone was lounging around stuffed and putting on extra pounds, my daughter and I decided to take a hike and go geocaching in an effort to mitigate the gazillion calories we had just inhaled. We sure were glad we did! This is a great nature area. We found six of the seven caches we went after and had a great time doing it. The "steps" were easy on the way down but a lot more difficult on the way up! Thanks for placing this cache. Very well deserving of a faforite point!!

kiecker	Found it	7/3/2016	We rolled in town on Friday tonight for a couple days of exploring a new town for us. Not quite sure what all we'll do but I'm sure we'll find some adventure, sites, and oddities. Today was our last day in Branson and there were still a section of caches that I wanted to attempt before heading back. I had been keeping an eye on the weather as it looked like there was only a small window of dry opportunity early in the morning before the rain was set to arrive. With that being said, Kai and I started our day with the sunrise to attempt all the caches at Lakeside Forest Wilderness Area. This area is ripe with juicy DTs, 3 ECs, and what appears to be an excellent trail system. We were both excited. We started with heading down the stairs and heading north, then back tracked and made a loop of the area. We picked up our pace a bit as we knew it was only time until the sky let completely loose and we'd be soaked. I hadn't read this cache prior to arriving so when I got there I had a different idea of where I was going to have to go to obtain. Luckily I didn't have to on this wet host.

The classes were perfectly timed with beautiful weather. We hit the Lakeside Forest Trails first. I love hiking and this trail system had more than a few caches we could find in a short amount of time. Wow there are caves on this trail too!?! Such a cool place! The morning sun was enough to light our way. Once inside, we were sad to see graffiti on the walls. It seems nowhere is safe from the selfish hands of hooligans. It was still a sight to see.

For two relatively old cachers we did pretty well. Walked about 5 miles and down and up those 338 steps! We ran into two muggles also enjoying the trail. They took to geocaching very quickly and we believe they will continue on when they return home to Springfield. The weather was absolutely wonderful. We had a great time!

Trail_Rated	Found it	12/24/2015	Out with the sander_sooners crew today picking up a few hides while in the area on Christmas vacation. Headed to eastern Oklahoma this afternoon. Looks like a good place to hold up if I was a soldier back in the day. Kids had lots of fun exploring this one. Thanks for the work you put into this hide.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
Sanders_Sooners	Found it	12/24/2015	Sanders Sooners #761, 4th find of the day. Christmas Eve caching with pwsnow family on a 60 degree day. Hiking the cliffside to the cave grabbing Earthcaches along the way. This is an amazing location and what caching is about. Took some photos, signed log, and left favorite point.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
L Frank	Found it	11/20/2015	Denmother and I cached in Branson today. This was a nice area and cache to find. The camo blended in well. We took a few pictures which revealed the graffiti some idiot sprayed on the cave wall. Favorite point for sure. Thanks, chuckswaggin, for placing this cache.

flowerchild60	Found it	11/7/2015	This was such a great weekend. I brought my Mother to Branson this weekend to meet up with my brother and sister-n-law to celebrate our Mother's 90th birthday. I had mentioned this cache and that one day I wanted to get the smiley. After I read the description to the family my brother said that he would like to go see this area. So after breakfast on Saturday we headed off for the adventure. Now neither one of us is in the best of shape but we had the confidence to get this done. The morning was a little cool so we had our jackets on. That didn't last long. After going down several sections of stairs we came to a landing that had a nice flat rock to the side. That is where we left our jackets for the rest of the trip down. We decided if they were gone oh well. On and on we went. The day was gorgeous!!! We reached a point where he saw one of the caves and he made the comment he wished he had a flashlight, he didn't so we continued on. After a while I got my phone out and realized we had gone past GZ. I commented that it would be really funny if the cave he looked at was GZ. We turned around and started the trek back. Yep, the cave he had looked at was GZ!!! And to make the adventure even better he was the one that spotted the cache. The morning was just wonderful!!! (And our jackets were still there). We passed a young lady that told us she walks those steps 3 time a day and sometimes 6 days a week! I'm just glad I made it down those steps and back up one time. Thanks so much for the adventure! Oh, and we did explore the cave which is my kind of cave.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

MMaru	Found it	9/13/2015	Whoo-whee! This cache has been on my radar for a long time. When I moved to Springfield a little over a year ago, I started asking cachers at events what some of their favorite caches were - this is one that kept coming up over and over! I was warned several times that it was one was not a cache to be taken lightly - don't do it right after it rains, it's not one recommended for someone who is overweight or out of shape, etc. Well, as I am a pretty heavy girl, I'd initially told myself that when I lose 50lbs, going for this cache would be my personal reward. Well... I still have those pounds, but I was in the area for the first time in a while. I was really hoping to make this one find #500 by collecting other caches along the way, but as I got to the park, I knew I'd have time to EITHER get to 500 finds, OR find this cache - I chose the latter! Getting though the grotto was really an incredible experience. There was no water, so I liked seeing the picture of the waterfall that is there when there's been heavy rains. I get why I was warned not to do this cache if I was out of shape - as soon as I started down those steps, I knew I'd hate myself in a little while. But I really wanted to collect this smiley, so I persevered! When I got to the cave, I'd misread the clue and thought that it said that the cache was right -inside- the cave. I set down my geobag and unzipped it to retrieve my flashlight... only to find that I had apparently never returned it to my bag after my one and only night caching excursion! ARGH! Knowing I was NOT going to climb back up and down those steps to get it from my car, nor was I going to just shrug it off and pass on this find, I grabbed my camera and proceeded to use the flash to search every crevice and bump in this cave! I probably spent a good half hour doing this, at least, and told myself half a dozen times that I was just going to have to give up and come back. On a hunch, I checked outside the cave, and voila! Nice, easy find which, as usual, I made much harder than it needed to be! But no regrets - I would have had a blast exploring this cave even without me mixing up the hint! I even made two little froggie friends in there. :) As I predicted, I sort of hated myself when it came time to go back up those steps - I've had knee problems since I was a kid and I knew it would kill my knees. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I did not plead for death rather than climb another step - extra bonus of this cache was realizing that even though I haven't been dropping any pants sizes, geocaching adventures like this have really been helping to improve my health and fitness! So happy I had the opportunity to go after this one! I can definitely tell why so many people recommended it! TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
Wanderlustatitsbest	Found it	9/13/2015	We stayed outside of Springfield then explored Branson a little before driving on to Tennessee today.

Specter	Found it	7/25/2015	This cache has been on my to do list ever since it came out and today I made it happen. After finding Tipped over and bypassing the steps and I almost wished I had back tracked and took the steps it was awful slippy after the rain from the night before. Hiking down to the top of the waterfall and seeing how large it was made the hike all the more worth while. I was able to search and find the cache without any problems. The cave floor was covered with water I didn't spend very long inside. Thanks for placing this cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
kimbotjr	Found it	7/24/2015	Returned to the Springfield and Branson areas for a couple of days of catching up with family, some relaxation, and of course working in a few cache visits. The caching was primarily focused on some higher D/Ts, some puzzles we had solved here and there, and a few others that were of interest. Hit the Lakeside Wilderness trails early in the morning, amid some fog and oodles of spider webs. The Soldier Cave cache was actually a return visit from earlier in the year, when we came away with a DNF. We fortunately came away with a find today, but it wasn't easy locating the well-hidden container. Great area, and great location for a cache. Thanks for the hide.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

I was a little nervous about possibly waking up some bats in the cave but there weren’t any to be found. I was pleasantly surprised by the little cave salamanders though. They were pretty cool. It’s amazing how much cooler it is in the cave versus only a few feet outside. Interesting history to this place. TFTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

The total finds at the end of day wasn't high, but the quality of caches was good and many of the locations provided some added interest and/or fun to our searches. The Lakeside Wilderness was our last place to cache today and is a great location. Unfortunately, looks like our timing wasn't good for this one. As we start to enter this log, we see that the cache recently went missing...which makes sense since our thorough search came up empty. We did enjoy visiting Soldier Cave.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

arkfiremedic	Found it	12/6/2014	A little leery heading down here alone to do such a high difficulty/terrain cache by myself, but hey we do what we got to do sometimes ;) My wife and daughter dropped me off this morning in the park and I told them to give me about three hours by myself so they could go spend my Christmas bonus in Branson (the main reason for the trip). Not wanting to sit in store parking lots for the majority of the day I decided to come to this park just off the strip to kill some time and shed some calories from all the eating we have been doing while in town. This was my third find in the park of many. It actually rained all day yesterday and the leaves were wet, but I took my time and was cautious on my decent down to the great cache here. The story behind this cache is some very interesting information to me. Thank you chuckswaggin for the fun I had today in the park. Of course I'll award this one with its 110th favorite point for sure! TFTC! AFM	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

NeverSeenGene	Found it	11/2/2014	I will add details and one or more photos when I get back home late next week, if not earlier. Thanks! [Okay, I am back home now. As for this cache, I was in Branson--up from my home in the North Carolina mountains--to see my grandkids who were down from Whiteman Air Force Base. Very early Sunday morning I got a little extra time to do some caching in the great Lakeside Forest Wilderness park and picked off this one--along with seven others on the lower trail(s) before rushing back for breakfast and church and then to meet everyone out at Silver Dollar City when it opened that afternoon. This one was a great hide in a great area in a very nice park. I enjoyed the walk and the search, as well as the find.

OrigamiFolder	Found it	9/19/2014	I was a little surprised to see muggles when I arrived as I thought I was cutting it close to get out of the park before close. Maybe that sundown thing is flexible? Well I've been meaning to come down here every time I come to Branson but the muggles or the weather always won out. Well today with some helpful insistence from DougHolly_NKC back home I dropped the muggles off at the water park and with surprising ease made my way around the park. I'd like to say I Running Jayhawked it but I don't really have that much speed and agility (it was my version of it anyway). Well the exploration of the cave was brief but enjoyable, I'll need to return with more time. Thanks!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Did that solder really live here for several years? That is really crazy to think about. I cannot imagine living in a cave for several years. We were able to finally able to make the find on this one after searching around for awhile. This was a good hide, tftc!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

bluetweet	Found it	5/30/2014	Kicked our rear ends. If it was dry it would have been easier, but as it was muddy, slippery, rainy. Poison Ivy every step of the way there and back, but let me tell you... The waterfall and the trek to and from the cave was a memory that Tweetylks and I shall remember always. Thanks to Chuckswaggin for giving us a destination that we would not have seen if there had not been a cache there. Regardless of it raining and the muddy, bloody clothes it was... "TOTALLY WICKED " ! ( meaning it was good). From Springfield, MO. TFTC >))><	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Mesozoic	Found it	4/30/2014	We drove down to Branson today with the main goal of grabbing most of the caches within this park. We found this one and several others within this park, such a nice park.

nukeworker	Found it	4/1/2014	While hiking in this park today, this cache was one of our goals to help fill our D/T grid. We took a side trail to the bottom trail and then headed NE towards this hide. Took a few moments of searching to produce the container. After signing the log we explored the cave and were saddened to see graffiti inside. What a great trail and beautiful cliffs. We are so glad we spent a few hours in this park. This cache earns a favorite point from us. Thanks for the adventure, Nukeworker and Racquetball Girl	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Abiectio	Found it	11/29/2013	Great location! This area wasn't originally on our route, but after a last minute change, and a bit of hustling and skipping of caches earlier in the day, Wrath557 and I were able to hunt some of the caches in this area. Too cool! The steps were nice and easy. On the way down that is. Loved the walk along the trail and had fun exploring the cave after we added our names to the log. Thanks for placing the cache and bringing us here. Awesome place!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
Wrath557	Found it	11/29/2013	We are on a two day geotrip through the area and found time to stop here and attempt these caches along the river. We hit the trail on a swift pace to make sure we got all the caches we wanted to attempt. Stairs are sure easy.... On the way down...lol. There was a few muggles hiking the trail, we made sure to wait until they moved on before SL. Great Fun and Awesome Location! Fav point on its way.

debrajean	Found it	11/7/2013	I'm on a great south Missouri caching run with louinliberty, Lady byonke and the better half of Trekkie79. Despite the rain we managed to pull in quite a few caches. Today was our most beautiful day of the trip. The rain let up and the sun came out. It made our hike along this trail wonderful. When it's this beautiful, it's my favorite time of the year. We had a bit of trouble locating the cache here, but eagle eyed louinliberty found it using a flashlight in the exact same spot we all tried to look in earlier. Wahoo! Favorite point! All in all...fun times. SL. TFTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
LouinLiberty	Found it	11/7/2013	Out on a south Missouri cache trip with debrajean, (Mrs.) byonke and (Mrs.) trekkie79. This was day three and we had a perfect day to be out and about. This was my targeted cache of the trip. I've heard so much about it and it certainly didn't disappoint us. The hike wasn't too bad but we sure spent a lot of time looking. And, we HAD looked there but, out of the blue, I pulled the rabbit out of the hat! Great fun. Thanks so much for the cache. I appreciate it.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
byonke	Found it	11/7/2013	This was the third and last day of our girly trip to the Branson area with louinliberty, debrajean, and the better half of Trekkie79. After the last two days of rain/cold weather we were happy to see the sun. Soldier Cave was the first cache on our agenda this morning. The journey to the cave sight and cache did not disappoint. The fall colors and the view were awesome. Absolutely no breeze and we could hear church bells in the valley. What really made this special was sharing it great friends. Of course, this will get a favorite. Thanks, Carlin, Liberty, Mo.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

lbkmmkmm	Found it	10/25/2013	Nice hike and an interesting spot. Was not an easy find once we got there. My gps battery died and so I had to use my cell phone to zero in on it. Also had to use my cell phone flashlight to explore all the cracks and crannies. It was a nice fall day - cool which made going back up the stairs nicer.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
fd SCorpion	Found it	10/21/2013	We were in town to take care of some family business and had to make the trek to get this one. I left my brother at the top of the trail because it appeared that the hike was going to be as advertised, and it didn't disappoint. The views of the rock formations and the water below were spectacular. I finally got to the area and my gps kept directing me down below and I spent a few minutes sliding around there. I got back up and looked at the hint and a few of the previous logs and decided to refocus my search. There it was, hidden quite nicely. I signed the log and placed the cache back and peered into the cave. It was really dark in there at 5 in the afternoon on a cloudy day, and I decided against going in. What a great place for a cache and amazing story. Thanks for the hide.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Picked up one cache in each of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma during that trip. Spending this week in Branson to see the sites and do some caching. This morning we drove north for a couple of earth caches and then cached back toward Branson for our lunch break.

I can't find any recent responses about maintaining this cache so for the time being it will be archived and removed from the active cache listings. We are no longer leaving caches stay disabled for extended periods of time. Groundspeak and the geocaching community appreciate your contributions to geocaching and I hope to see this cache back in operation soon. If you can get it back up and running in the next week or so contact me to get it re-listed. Otherwise plan to move it slightly and set up a new cache page. [B][green]Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published.

Mongo	Temporarily Disable Listing	9/24/2011	[b][u][red]OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED[/b][/u][/red] Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last several logs on this cache it appears that this cache is in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the [red][b]”NEEDS MAINTENANCE”[/b][/red] attribute is showing you will need to do the following. http://tinyurl.com/y8n7vuy Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and will be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

Capn Sea Bert	Found it	8/10/2011	I was in Forest park a few days ago but it was packed with people. Today I came much later and there was no one at the waterfall, so I took off my shoes and socks and got in the water. After I had put the cache back, I started putting my shoes back on when a family wandered up with a GPS. I talked with them and found out that they were in town from Kansas City, so I helped them find the cache and they put in a travelbug making its way across the US from California.

CribbageWitch	Found it	5/1/2011	OCW Hobbit Taz on a nice start to a questionable day. The sun is shining this morning but rain is on the way. We were quite surprised to see a cache in this condition. It had been a long time since I had seen a cache in only a flimsy baggie. After I got home and we read the page more closely, we feel that the cache has been muggled or someone just needed a serviceable container for their own use. I had given this area a look in consideration for a cache some time ago and this one published a matter of days after I mentioned the possibility to HT. When it published, I almost accused him of "First Degree Cache Location Pilferage." TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2J9C6_the-cave-behind-the-waterfall
Hobbit Taz	Needs Maintenance	5/1/2011	Looking at the previous logs and the cache description compared with what CribbageWitch and I found today, It appears the container should be checked on by the owner. We found just a thin sandwich baggie that I wouldn't count on to stay in good condition for any length of time on its own. Not sure what happened to the main clear plastic container. Currently log and contents were not in bad shape.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2J9C6_the-cave-behind-the-waterfall

roelsch	Found it	4/2/2011	Out and about with Mean Gene and The Rooter on a half-day of geocaching.

I spotted the cache and made the retrieval with some guidance from Mean Gene. TNLNSL.

Mean Gene	Found it	4/2/2011	Caching with Roelsch on an abbreviated day of caching in the local area. The park was really crowded and the ffrroggs were busy searching when we arrived. Roelsch employed the knowledge gained over years of geocaching and pretty much went right to it. Using my 10,000 candle power passive illumination device I could see the cache as I chatted with the ffrroggs. Signed log MG, TR and RO for brevity. Took nothing and left nothing. Good job.

I repaid the gods with some CITO – a bag of trash and a lawn chair. Perfect CITO location, since you walk by a roadside trash can on your way out. Left my signature card. Took what looked like a tire weight, probably lead and toxic so a danger to kids. Thanks SLUH Science Club for a great hide in a fun part of the park that I like.

myotis	Didn't find it	11/18/2010	Well, I am glad I looked with my flashlight before sticking my hands into a crevice. I spotted a syringe. Thank goodness I looked first and did not get stuck. I carefully removed it. But after that, I lost my desire to keep looking for this cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2J9C6_the-cave-behind-the-waterfall
sgtmta	Found it	11/18/2010	FTF - 8:25 a.m. One little mentioned advantage to being your own boss is the ability to run off to find new caches which pop up close to home. This morning, sgt headed to the cache site, while mta dropped our daughter at nearby Crossroads College Preparatory School. sgt scouted the site, but determined that mta, who is much more of a mountain goat than she (probably due to his growing up in NH, and her growing up in the Black Swamp of Ohio), would most likely make the find and retrieve the cache. And that is what happened. Be careful poking around in some of the nooks and crannies, where other debris has been left behind. Thanks for this new Forest Park cache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2J9C6_the-cave-behind-the-waterfall
*gln	Post Reviewer Note	11/18/2010	Congratulations, Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site . One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one guy here with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . Looks fun, Enjoy! Cheers & Thanks for your contributions to Geocaching, Glenn "Seek quality, not quantity".

I didn't want to back track so I started searching for a way down and that wasn't going to be easy. Once I did find a way down I find out I have re-do half of that.

The last approach to the cache was a bit trecherous for an old timer with ice and snow still clinging to the rocks from the last storm. but bottom line is we did find it and logged the squirrel cave.

topgun5403 & Co-Pilot Marty	Found it	10/26/2013	Find #9027. After spending the morning trail riding at the Bucks and Spurs Ranch, we had lunch at the Rockbridge Trout Ranch and then stopped to pick up a few caches here. The trees, although not in full color, were nonetheless spectacular. Initially took the wrong trek to the cache, but realized our mistake and then got on the right path in short order. When we pulled the log out to sign, we thought that we had found another lonely cache, but it appears that it was logged online. This was one of our favorites for the day and it also earns a favorite vote. Thanks for your efforts in placing this cache and bringing us here.

SterlingConnie	Found it	2/17/2012	After completing a cache maintenance trip to Cedar Gap we turned our attention to this area of geocaches. This one threw us for a momentary loop, but after looking at the terrain rating I realized we were looking in the wrong location. After a quick location adjustment, this cache was soon in hand. Our original intentions for visiting this area was a trip into Browns Cave, but we found ourselves running short on time and another issue arose that motivated us to postpone that adventure.

BigHef32	Found it	7/27/2011	After having a big morning of FTFs with the kids, and 2 more with ScottyLove and Bride, we took the opportunity to explore this super cool area. For the purpose of cache density, we whipped up a container from my geo-backpack and Scotty spotted this squirrel cave. Bride of ScottyLove and I signed in the #2 spot when Scotty made the hide and waited a few months for someone to journey out and sign the top spot. This place is definitely worth checking out, as well as the Abbey up the road!! Thanks Scotty for hiding this one and doubling the reason to come out here!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2RDWQ_the-abbey--squirrel-cave
Semipaw	Found it	6/25/2011	FTF #37 After finding the other nearby cache, we had to venture down this neat trail to this one. This was a very neat walk along the river. Those are some very high cliffs. Spent about five minutes looking around GZ; there are a lot of "squirrel caves" in the immediate area. I read the description again and looked at the terrain rating, then made the necessary adjustment to get to the cache. The cache is in good shape. It was lying out in the open outside the "cave", so I replaced it back inside more securely so it wouldn't be washed away. One good rainstorm and this cache might have washed away. Very neat place. Thanks for placing this one to compliment the other nearby cache. It's a long drive over here for these two caches, but worth it.

*gln	Post Reviewer Note	8/4/2012	[b][green] ONE MONTH LEFT [/b][/green] Greetings, I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs. I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. [b] If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches. [/b] If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. From the guidelines... http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint "... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b] normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing." Thanks for your understanding. When you have made all repairs, please remember to post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries.

RRnCakes	Found it	7/6/2017	Out with Valkarie63 today. Spent quite a bit of time at the museum, then hiked to the cave area and limestone rock formation. Earth caches are quickly becoming my favorite type of cache and this is one of the best. Interesting history of the area and of the rock formations.

Darth Leviosa	Found it	4/2/2016	On a road trip with Mrs Leviosa and Darth Jr from the Chicago area to visit some family in Springfield, MO. We had a free Saturday morning. I thought Mrs and Jr might want to swim at the hotel, but instead we went for a hike in this great park instead. Cool area! We had a nice hike from the museum up up up the hill and then down down down to the rock formations and the cave entrance. I didn't realize we couldn't go into the cave itself so that was a little disappointing. I just looked at the pics on their website and it looks awesome. The outside was pretty cool though, so no complaints. As we were getting read to leave, we heard a noise. I thought it sounded like a cat, and sure enough a black cat came out of the rocks and towards us. It looked to be in good shape and ended up following us all the way back to the museum. The workers there were aware of the cat. We did not take it home since we have 3 black cats already :) Thanks for bringing us here!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave

hortcacher	Found it	12/29/2015	This was our last stop of the day. We have been to the museum once before, but we always seem to arrive at closing time. Today was no exception, but we managed to get the answers to the questions. When we approached the cave opening to get an altitude and estimate the size, we set off the alarm. Thankfully they did not come to get us with handcuffs! The answers to the questions have been e-mailed.

MMaru	Found it	12/8/2015	I rounded out my visit to this area today by ending at Riverbluff Cave! There were two paths leading towards it from the Natural History Museum. I took the woodchip path there and was delighted to see the various signs labeling the different species of trees in the area along the way – very neat! Since I love to read and don’t like to just walk so much, I’ve found a happy medium by reading WHILE I walk. On my way back down the trail from doing the other ECs, I read the information page for this cache – WOW, what a cool cave! I was wondering exactly how they were maintaining the air pressure mentioned – got that answered when I went to see the cave entrance! I’d love to go inside but knowing how easily humans can affect a cave, I’d hate for my curiosity to damage all the amazing discoveries down there! Thanks for yet another amazingly fun and interesting earth cache! I had a lot of fun crawling around the rock formation above the cave. On the way back to where my car was parked at the museum, I took the gravel path and saw lots of great spots to camp or just hang out – definitely will have to keep this place in mind for future get-togethers! Answers have been e-mailed – TFTEC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave

This was one earth cash that I picked out on the path I had laying out to stop by and take a look. Always too bad that there's so much amazing treasure hidden underneath you're at that a lot of times we can never find. Well email with answers once I have access to a computer. Thank you for the fine! And being part of the day	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave
iPajero	Found it	7/17/2015	Wow, reading through the listing the inside of this cave must truly be amazing. Wonder just how many people have actually seen the inside since it was discovered. We just had to do this earth cache, but knew when we set out that it was only to view externally. Thanks for the development of this earth cache and all the research that went in to it. Earns a favorite point. Our Travel Companion TB31M47 and Cache Mobile TB59EG4 came along for the ride. [b]Greetings from South Africa![/b] A bit on our background: At the outset of our holiday we had found 11656 caches (all done in southern Africa) and this is this first time we are caching on another continent. The logo on our 'all terrain' caching mobile reads "I would rather be lost in the woods than found in the city" and our travel companion TB has traveled over 195 000 kilometers achieving this milestone as we have explored the wide open and untamed expanses of southern Africa. It is, therefore, with some trepidation that we set out caching in the vast expanse of USA with its enormous cities and massive network of freeways in a first world country. Having overcome encounters with dangerous wild animals (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, hyenas and hippopotamus) in game parks, this does give us a degree of confidence that we will be up to any challenge the USA may have for us. A quote that we hold dear reads "Every morning you are handed 24 golden hours. They are one of the few things in this world that you get free of charge. If you had all the money in the world, you couldn't buy an extra hour. What will you do with this priceless treasure?". While in the USA we will endeavor to use the hours we have to discover as much of the country as possible and find some caches along the way.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave

nukeworker	Found it	12/31/2014	While spending some time in Branson from our home in Arkansas, we took a day to cache in Springfield. We parked near the museum and made our way to GZ where we made our observations. We had driven next to it while approaching the parking waypoint and found it to be an impressive feature on the land. Our email has been sent and we appreciate you developing this geological lesson. Thanks for the fun, Nukeworker and Racquetball Girl	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave
MyMuggleMother	Found it	10/12/2014	Out with Scout's Mix (she sent our answers together). She insisted the paved trail was the correct trail, but I got to tell her "I told you so." Thanks so much for this cache! I don't usually log in separately, but thought I might as well get credit for this one today. Thanks!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave
Scout's Mix	Found it	10/12/2014	Did this one with MyMuggleMother. There was a remote control car race going on which prompted us to park on the lower side of the museum. This might have also prompted us to take the paved trail first. I might have insisted we were going the right way, and she might have said she thought we should be on the other side of the creek...when I did admit I thought she was right she about smacked me over the head and muttered something about mom's always being right. We then made the climb, found the right trail and enjoyed the path--though we were booking it as we didn't have much sunlight left and wanted to make sure to be out on time. We did finish before the car thing was over though, so all's well. Thanks so much for placing this one. We really had fun (though she might mutter otherwise, haha).	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave

cjhoffy	Found it	4/15/2014	Spending a few days in SW MO. I mainly plan to finish the MO Rt 66 challenge. I started that when I was finishing the MO 2001 challenge in the St. Louis area. At the beginning of this trip, I only had four counties left for the Rt 66 challenge. I am picking up as many caches as I can for other challenges as well, and some other caches along the way. I had hoped to find the Letterbox in this park. That didn't happen. I scouted out the answers for this Earthcache while I was here. I enjoyed exploring the area. Thanks for the geology lesson.

Unitzoid	Found it	3/22/2014	The Southwest Passage #16 (1:40 PM) Atomic Goat's Breath, Old Professor and I hoofed it from the museum and up a trail. Sure, it looked like we could have driven, but small cacti seen nearby scratched that idea. The walk was certainly wonderful as a warm breeze pressed us on. We approached the coordinates and marveled at the stone features here. Very cool! Data was collected as per EarthCaching protocol. We spent some time simply enjoying the gorgeous, sunny day. Eventually, we had to return. Thank you for highlighting a location that was nearly lost!

Today was our most beautiful day of the trip. The rain let up and the sun came out. It made our hikes through the hills in the parks wonderful. When it's this beautiful, it's my favorite time of the year. I love earthcaches so I'm glad I got to add this one to the found list.

BigChiefS4	Found it	4/19/2013	Hello from Minnesota! This is Day 6 of my Branson geocaching vacation. My parents are on vacation in Branson and I tagged along to do some geocaching. Today I headed north towards Springfield, grabbed a few along the way and then a few more when I got back. My goal is to get some of the high favorited caches and get at least 20 in each state (there's a couple of challenges back in MN for this sort of thing). No rain today and partly cloudy skies made for a great day of caching. I had a really great conversation with Matt, who works at the Mineral Institute. He gave me a lot of great information about the caves at this site. He is also a former Marine, and with me being retired Army, we shared a few war stories. Thanks for the very cool Earthcache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave

Cache House	Found it	9/14/2012	Great place to visit! It was pouring rain but I was not going to pass this one up. Coming from Florida where we do not see caves I wanted to make sure I visited this one. Climbed up and took the required measurements then just circled down and around to get a view of the entrance. I wanted to grab the other caches in the area but the rain was starting to come down even harder so I headed back to the parking area. Needless to say when I came walking out of the woods the people in the museum there gave me so pretty strange looks....

Sir Dreward III	Found it	8/25/2012	OCW darkanimals. I also had never been to Riverbluff Cave, so we decided to pick this earthcache up while caching in the area.

darkanimals	Found it	8/25/2012	OCW Sir Dreward III. I had never been to Riverbluff Cave, so I can check that one off the list. We spoke with a gentleman sifting through clay brought up from the cave, and he detailed some of their recent findings. From what I recall, the cave is approximately three football fields deep, and the clay is removed by hand and transported in buckets. He also said it would be another ten years before they reached their desired depth in the cave.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave

Our four days started off really hopeful but sad to say, ended in something akin to primal terror as a massive storm pummeled the park. We got out okay, so all is well on that front. On an even better note, we were able to have a load of fun caching the general area as well, and this is one of the caches we found. Email with answers will be coming shortly. This cache was the 43rd of 58 total caches found while on vacation. Thanks, Shoney1, for placing this cache! -Fulton, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave

NixaDudes	Found it	11/25/2011	Find #1,303 Found this cache this morning and definitely our favorite of the day...we learned so much and already told everyone about it. The climbs are not bad at all and I'd encourage everyone to come check this out. This was our #7 for the X Dies challenge today so we have to stop.

OzarksJim	Found it	10/23/2011	Find #4843 and 1st of 2 finds today with my son, OzarksRyan. I can't believe that after several weeks I'm only the second person to log this great Earthcache. It was Sunday when Ryan and I got here so the museum was closed and we were the only ones here. There was a chain across the gravel road that led up the hill, but I hoped that was only meant to prevent vehicle traffic because we walked around it and up the hill. The view from the top was great and I took coordinates there to get the elevation. We then walked down the hill and figured out the way around the rocks to the cave entrance. I took lots of great pictures while I was here. Answers have been e-mailed. I've always wanted to explore this spot and am glad I finally got the opportunity to do so. Hopefully one day they will open up the cave so we can all see inside it. TFTEC! ~OzarksJim - Willard, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35EWE_riverbluff-cave
chuck80196	Found it	10/13/2011	FTF#77! Made the trip to GX because I was curious and nobody had logged it yet. I heard about this cave and drove by it more than once not even knowing it was there. I must be driving in my sleep! I walked the path and acquired the necessary information. I think my estimates might not have been the best in all cases, the CO indicated that I have met the criteria. Logging this per Shoney1! Awesome earth cache! I would love to go in this cave sometime! T4$!

bluedaisy	Didn't find it	5/24/2017	I'm logging this as a DNF, but actually we couldn't even get to GZ to search. Looks like the flood got pretty high here and we got almost to the rocky part of the trail and then it got impassible. It is piled up with flood debris (lots of stick and brush and whatever the flood washed along here. At this point we aborted since we did not see another good way to get there.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35TEX_cave-trail-cache

mamalu	Found it	5/27/2013	Took a bit of an hour to drive here today. Pulled in as far as I could (you then have to back out) and got out. Took some convincing of myself that this was a real way to go. Looked like a ditch or something but I kept on and finally got a glimpse of the little trail that follows the river. With so much greenery now it was hard to see. Lots of PI, hope that doesn't come back to haunt me. Despite it all I basically walked right to the cache. I didn't recall it being a micro or I might not have attempted. However, it was easy to find. Thanks!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC35TEX_cave-trail-cache
hightechhillbilly	Owner Maintenance	5/19/2013	Sure Nuff, there it was.....gone! Looking at the debris line from the flood, I'd guess that the cache was barely in the water.

Seahawk4 (SH4)	Found it	3/28/2012	Seems as though I've walked by this bluff several times on my way to and from Cliffhanger before realizing that this was the bluff the Bat Cave Cache was on, lol. I came by here yesterday after my stand off with Shoney and Chuck's snakes at their new gz down the way. I was thinking...well...while I'm in the neighborhood :) Took a running leap cross the creek, because my board had washed away after the recent rains. I got water in one boot, which wasn't too bad, because I could've slipped and had been totally drenched....so one wet boot was not too bad. Up the rock pile I went and trudged up the bluff to the top. Semipaw is right about the gps bouncing around. I landed at gz right away, and should have trusted my senses better. I decided, however to follow the gps and the durn thing had me within 9 feet of the cache on several of the tiers, lol. At one point I was within inches of the cache, but the lighting was not in my favor and I had just had a stand off with several snakes, so I wasn't reaching into too many places just yet. Then it happened. I was kneeling down on one of the edges reading the gps....when it said 9 feet behind me. I looked behind me..... 9 feet behind me was a large vein of calcite fractured down the middle. That was all she wrote for the cache. I walked over to the wall to take pictures. Put my hand on the fracture and leveraged it just a bit and a beautiful piece of unmarred calcite laid in my hands. Holy cow! I started looking in the pile of rocks just under the vein and came up with several other pieces. Then I started walking the tiers to see what else was there. When my time was getting short I bid farewell to the bluff, travelled the rocky passage back to the tunnel and home I went. Fast forward to this morning. I had some things to do, but I wanted also to go back to the bluff and find the cache. So when time allowed it I struck off towards the bluff once again. I left the gps hooked to my hip and went to where I started yesterday. OK...I'm not leaving this spot until I have this thing in my hand! Oh, Hey! There it is! Now why didn't I "see" that yesterday? Good Grief, I nearly got a picture of it to boot yesterday, lol. Wouldn't that be funny...to be looking through the pictures and then finding the cache that way :D Once my name was on the log I struck off to discover where the source of the waterfall was. I found that too! ...and believe it or not I found a mini wetlands parked on top of the bottom tier. This bluff and others in the area have been an immense source of entertainment these past few weeks, lol. So thank you, Mr. Diveheavin, for placing these caches in these areas! You still rock!

Semipaw	Found it	3/10/2012	FTF #71 Okay, I made this one really hard. We ended up on the wrong tier for the grab. I won't say which tier I was on at first, because I don't want to make it any easier for future finders. The cliffs here really play havoc on your GPS. At one point it said I was 10 feet from the cache, and that was while I was on the wrong tier. I fully explored a difficult crevice to climb. Loose rocks abounded, and I really shouldn't have even attempted it. Come to find out, I was in the wrong spot, and on the wrong tier. Once I discovered that, me and Jarrin made our way to the correct tier, and it was a fairly quick grab after that. We saw the bat that you probably named the cache after. It was hanging quietly upside down, just four or five feet from the cache. We didn't disturb it, just watched it for a few moments before signing the log. We took a few minutes to rest for a while and watch the cars zooming by on Highway 65 down below. This is a really neat spot to just sit, especially at night. I decided to call it quits for the night after this one. I was tuckered out from all the climbing. Thanks for the fun tonight. I can't wait to go after the rest of your new caches soon.

We searched for the first at almost 9am and left a few caches in a power trail around 2pm. We didn't have many problems. I know a few of the searches where not going to be smooth.

RicknJoy	Found it	3/17/2014	Out on a Century Run today with fearlessknits and Arthur & Trillian - we signed logs as “Team FAR“. It started out pretty cold in the early morning darkness, but developed into a beautiful day! We followed our route line (for the most part) through Nixa, Ozark, Highlandville, Spokane, and all the way down towards Bull Creek. The 130+ caches we found kind of blur together, but I know we visited a LOT of cedar trees (and a few Osage oranges - ouch!) We had to keep moving, but we had very few DNFs and give-ups! All in all, a tiring but fun day! Thank you for placing this cache and making this kind of pointless activity possible! RicknJoy (R) Maries county, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3HE9B_cave-hollow-north
ArtieD	Found it	3/17/2014	OCW fearlessknits and Ricknjoy. Mr. Rick had an idea...an idea to go on a Century Run in the Springfield area. He asked us if we wanted to go, and there was no question at all...OF COURSE! So, after picking a day, we patiently looked at the weather. Initially, it looked great, but Mother Nature looked as if she wanted to throw a monkey wrench in our plans. On Sunday, the weather was not looking so hot and reservations were pronounced about the trip. However, over time, the skies cleared and things improved, so the trip was on! The trip began early for all of us, traveling from our respective home bases to meet up for the one big run, which we did. The weather was cold, bot otherwise very pleasant. Soon, we arrived at our first cache and after some time we found it. We started to loosen our cache senses up and the finds started to pick up in a much quicker manner. All in all, we decimated the goal of 100 caches on the day! Not bad and a great team effort! This cache was the 127th cache out of 143 caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, Semipaw, for placing this cache and for the fun! -Fulton, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3HE9B_cave-hollow-north

fearlessknits	Found it	3/17/2014	Cave hollow south OCW Ricknjoy and Arthur & Trillian, Century Run This pair were nice quick additions to our big total for the day! Signed as Team FAR	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3HE9G_cave-hollow-south
RicknJoy	Found it	3/17/2014	Out on a Century Run today with fearlessknits and Arthur & Trillian - we signed logs as “Team FAR“. It started out pretty cold in the early morning darkness, but developed into a beautiful day! We followed our route line (for the most part) through Nixa, Ozark, Highlandville, Spokane, and all the way down towards Bull Creek. The 130+ caches we found kind of blur together, but I know we visited a LOT of cedar trees (and a few Osage oranges - ouch!) We had to keep moving, but we had very few DNFs and give-ups! All in all, a tiring but fun day! Thank you for placing this cache and making this kind of pointless activity possible!

ArtieD	Found it	3/17/2014	OCW fearlessknits and Ricknjoy. Mr. Rick had an idea...an idea to go on a Century Run in the Springfield area. He asked us if we wanted to go, and there was no question at all...OF COURSE! So, after picking a day, we patiently looked at the weather. Initially, it looked great, but Mother Nature looked as if she wanted to throw a monkey wrench in our plans. On Sunday, the weather was not looking so hot and reservations were pronounced about the trip. However, over time, the skies cleared and things improved, so the trip was on! The trip began early for all of us, traveling from our respective home bases to meet up for the one big run, which we did. The weather was cold, bot otherwise very pleasant. Soon, we arrived at our first cache and after some time we found it. We started to loosen our cache senses up and the finds started to pick up in a much quicker manner. All in all, we decimated the goal of 100 caches on the day! Not bad and a great team effort! This cache was the 126th cache out of 143 caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, Semipaw, for placing this cache and for the fun! -Fulton, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3HE9G_cave-hollow-south

purple	Found it	4/1/2019	TFTC! I replaced the log, but it's not an official log. It's just a scrap of paper in a regular sandwich-sized baggie I happened to have with me (Don't worry, there was never any food in it). You might want to replace the baggie with one that is more heavy-duty, so it doesn't get soaked like the last one.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave
Gusterroids	Found it	3/29/2019	Gathered the needed info over a week ago as I completed another cache in the park, then back for the final today. These 2 ends are all part of the same cave? Whoa!

mpmcmillen	Found it	1/10/2019	I enjoyed a day hunting caches (mainly F-G) caches with my oldest son while he was home from college on break. It was great having him along to help with some of the more difficult D/T caches. As an older teenager it brought back fun memories of searching out caches, but at a level he now enjoys (rather than just simple Tupperware in the woods). We both really liked Stage 1 and then we headed over to stage two. He managed the honeysuckle and grabbed the final before I could get there. The log was very wet and just barely singable.

ZeLuvBirds	Found it	5/4/2018	Decided to do a little more caching after my allergy shots. This time I parked the car close to the nearest one - "15 Years of Caching" (or so I thought!) After a 20 minute walk/hike, I found it, and then made the 30 minute longer hike to another one, and then another 30 minute walk to this one! The cache is in good order, the log is dry, and the area is clear! I walked right by a big black stick on my way to this one, but then my brain told me the stick did not quite look like a stick should. I had stepped right over it and my foor was inches from it in passing - I turned back around to see said stick again and found it was actually a black snake warming itself in the sun! This brought a little ... excitement? Trepidation? t my search!) Went on to find the cave, and the second cave. Dropped a traveler and picked up a traveler. Thanks for the hide and the fun!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave

spiritwolf922	Found it	2/5/2017	Out caching with Aunt Dot, JamrokShake and How-D on a fine, spring-like day... even though it's February. We had a wonderful time walking the grounds and enjoying the artwork while we hunted for caches. This was the last one for us today. How-D mentioned that he had cleaned out the park, while the rest of us still need one more... but we were tired and hungry by this point and wanted to get some lunch. For this cache, we found point A and made the calculations easily enough, but despite my entering the coordinates into my gps correctly and verifying that they were correct, my device just didn't want to cooperate, so I had to rely on my phone. I'll have to try to figure out where I went wrong. Still, we headed off to find the final and I had to get a little dirty making the grab. Nicely done, but I don't think I'll want to go spelunking in this cave any time soon. TFTC!!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave

Finally got near GZ and I spotted my quest but no cache. Looked for a minute and then spotted the cache. Luckily there were numerous natural tott near by, and I was able to retrieve the container. Cache and log in good shape. This one gets a favorite point. TNLNSL. TFTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave

Smokey48	Found it	2/29/2016	Headed over to the park after the "B Leaped" event to finish the park (at least for a little while). Lots of families out on such a nice day. I had worked this one before but didn't put my solved coords where I could get to them. So went back to the start, did my math, and headed to the end site. Missed the first cachers trail so bushwacked a little and found the cave. Did a quick scan and didn't see what I was looking for and knew it had to be there so looked around and didn't see anyone so I spun around three times and miniaturized myself and jumped down the hole and then found it about where I thought it would be. (I was just checking to see if you were reading this Ethan) Actually after the initial search I grabbed a nature-made TOTT and had the cache in hand (Still muddy). New log started by last finder, so added swag and left the TB in cache. Thanks Forest-Ghost for this hide. Smokey48	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave

Team Tismon	Found it	1/30/2016	I've been here dozens of times and never knew about the second "cave". That's a pretty nice site and makes for a fun cache. I started out near the first waypoint and had to look if there's a cache nearby (there had to have been one near here, right?) and sure enough, you have a nice multi starting at that point. I have some nice photos of the first site, but can't post them since they would give away the answers, but I can post the second ones. Also, the log was too wet to sign so we just took a photo of the cache once we had it. Thanks for the adventure and fun cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave
tricks33	Found it	12/3/2015	Found it! With a little help from the CO we found this cache! Amazing location for a geocache! TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave
EntropyEndeavor	Found it	11/29/2015	Really fun location! The part that seems the craziest to me is that the cache owner managed to find both of the locations for this multi-cache. Stage 1 was easy to get to. The one clue was a tiny bit ambiguous, but we figured it out easy enough. Stage 2 was even more interesting. I made it far harder than it needed to be. Let's just say that I should have payed more attention to the situation before trying to make the find. This was the dirtiest I've gotten from caching so far. My mom released her first trackable here. Please take it on a good adventure!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave

Specter	Found it	12/17/2014	Out caching with Tasmo we are on a mission in the St Louis area to search for clues for a close by puzzle cache and I bet you know which one we are searching for. When we arrived at the park I didn't realize that this was a cache I was needing. We search and found the first part and headed over to the final and started searching I did a real good look at one spot and should have know that it would be there but I missed it. Tasmo headed back to the place and I said something to him and he then mad the find. We signed the log and I found some much needed information. Thanks for a really nice hide.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave
tasmo	Found it	12/17/2014	OCW Specter, we hit Laumeier Park after doing some running around researching a local puzzle cache. We went to the cave and found the information we needed to calculate the location of the next waypoint, and continued on to find some other caches before heading over to the final on this one. This one took a bit, but after Specter yelled over and said, "Check there!", we had to wonder how we missed in the first time we looked. We signed the log and replaced all as found. Thank you for placing this multi, Forest-Ghost!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave
brantole	Found it	12/13/2014	I remember seeing The Lost Treasure series some time ago, but somehow it slipped off my radar. Today I put it back on the radar and found the first location.

buffettmo	Found it	11/8/2014	Brought my two kids, Liv64 and bluesrule74 to the sculpture park today. I knew they would love the structure at the first waypoint so we decided to work on this multi today. We spent some time at the cave and we snapped a few pictures and then did the calculations and headed for the final. We made our way to GZ and I did a search for the second cave. We found that rather easily but we spent about 15 minutes looking for the cache all while I was trying to make sure neither of them did anything that would necessitate a trip to the ER. Finally I had a hunch where we might find this one, so I did the dirty work while they spotted where I should look. We retrieved the cache and signed the log. We enjoyed our adventure! Thanks for helping us find these 2 very interesting spots in the park. This one earns a favorite! Thanks Forest-Ghost!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave

lafitefl	Didn't find it	5/26/2014	My second disappointment of the day. The cave was cool but the "puzzle" ... Well unless I did something wrong (most likely) the coords to stage 2 seemed pretty far away. Not sure how things are done locally I decided not to gamble and moved on, chalking this up to one of the reasons multi's don't get visited nearly as often. Oh well. Interesting cave nonetheless.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave
SCGeoNinja	Found it	5/25/2014	This one was the main reason we came to this park. And I'm really glad we did too! This was a really awesome place to visit. All the pieces of art, and all the cool stuff here to see was great! And this one was a really cool cache! The spot at stage 1 was awesome. Enjoyed sitting down for a quick rest. Neat to see old history like this. The final took us a second to spot, coords were close, but just a hair off, so we both had to wander around, and we finally spotted it at the same time! A neat place, and a fun final. All around made for a really great cache! Thanks for putting this one out! TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3RTMY_the-cave

cbusgo	Found it	5/19/2019	Came up from Clarksville Tn with my son to do some caching in this area. Didn’t know we would be doing it in the rain. Received a new TB Smokey the bear 75th birthday. Now I’m out trying to spread the word about preventing forest fires.Educating everyone on preventing forrest fires. Here's a few ways of doing so. When setting fireworks off, keep a bucket of water near by, never set them off in a dry grassy area. Campfires, should be surrounded by rocks keeping a shovel and water near by. Cigarettes, keep a cup of water or an ashtray near by. Never throwing a cigarette out the car window or on the ground. Comply with all local law and regulation. Check the weather. Only use easily controlled locations for burning. Do not burn anything unusual or combustible. SL TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3TPER_your-week-or-mine

*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	12/7/2018	STATUS UPDATE or OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED Greetings, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last few logs it appears that this cache may be in need of repair or at the very least, a checkup. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little look and TLC. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. Boring snip from the guidelines... CACHE MAINTENANCE "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the ”NEEDS MAINTENANCE” attribute is showing you will need to do the following. CACHES THAT NEED MAINTENANCE Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and may be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I will be looking forward to hearing back from you soon. In the meantime your cache has been disabled.

He needs counties I don't need and vice versa, which means we will not get done this trip. We may never accomplish all these $%#* goals. My short-term goal is to get done with counties and Delorme pages early next year and then finish up Missouri virtuals after that. This one took us a minute, but then Phil came up with this sneaky hide. Many thanks!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3TPER_your-week-or-mine

Any challenge should be able to be verified through my public profile, and all virtual and earth caches answers will be sent by one member of our group (to save emails). We stamped the logs with our individual stampers All challenges which cannot be verified via my public profile will be addressed shortly.

I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. [b] If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches. [/b] If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. From the guidelines... http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint "... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b] normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing." Thanks for your understanding. When you have made all repairs, please remember to post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page.

dc2swhill	Didn't find it	5/11/2013	ocw/ YN2HILL. This was our first stop after a wonderful lunch at Mama Locas. The owner has plugged this cache to me a couple of times and toady Dad and I decided to head out for it. We were able to park close and started our hour long search. Both of our GPS would not settle down. With a couple of hints we had a good idea what the host was. YN2 gave that spot a good search and we both searched just about every hole in the surrounding terrain but we came up empty. Got a message later in the afternoon that confermed that the correct spot had been searched. It has been awhile since my contact had found it so I didnt whant to post a needs maintenance log. I know how caches can get moved around. If you do have a chance to check on it and it is there we would love to come back and make the find. Very cool area. A side note in all the holes we searched I didnt find one snake but I did find my first geo-mouse. He or she was upset I stuck my hand in its home. I asked it where the cache was but it wasnt talking.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3W0Z3_lost-our-marbles-by-the-cave
train1904	Found it	3/15/2013	Spiritguide and I had the nerve to drive by the NT sign. The rope was down anyway. We finally got to gz but it took us awhile. I found that the cache had fallen through and had animal chew marks on it. We signed the log and put the cache back with a stick to hold it in place. Cool place - literally.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3W0Z3_lost-our-marbles-by-the-cave
SpiritGuide	Found it	3/15/2013	We tried to get this cache last fall but the road was closed. When we strived the temperature dropped about 20 degrees durr to the water and cave.

topgun5403 & Co-Pilot Marty	Found it	10/27/2012	Find #6517. Taking advantage of the beautiful fall day to do some cache clean-up northwest of town. Have been wanting to do this cache since it came out and today was the day. Nice hike in and what a neat area! Did a little exploring of the cave before we started the search and once completed, it was time to get to work. It took a while for the GPS to settle down and then we started looking in earnest. After a few minutes we spotted the little rascal. Very well done for your first cache, congratulations! This one also gets a favorite vote as well.

Specter	Found it	9/6/2012	This was on my to do list as soon as I seen it come out. We were planning on a Springfield trip and I knew what I was I was going to do as soon as I could get away. First thing Saturday morning I head out to search for the cache. After driving around what seem like hours I finally find the way into the cache area. I park and make the short hike in and start searching and not doing very will at all. I kind of gave up and decided to get my flashlight and do some cave exploring and it was worth the trip in. After exploring the cave I started my search again and had the log in my hands after about 5 mins. As I was signing the log I look up and Sir Dreward III and darkanimals come walking up, no need for them to search for a log. It was nice meeting and talking with them. Thanks for placing this cache it is getting a favorite point. Specter Sedalia MO. This entry was edited by Specter on Tuesday, 11 September 2012 at 01:29:18 UTC.

Sir Dreward III	Found it	9/6/2012	OCW darkanimals after some disc golf at the Ash Grove Park. We were headed down the access road and saw a truck sitting parked at the end and I thought, "Great there is probably some guys working on the little station thing down here." Well we got all the way down there and there was no one to be seen, so we proceded on into the woods. Lo and behold, we came upon the owner of the truck and he (Specter) was right in the middle of signing the log. Nice of him to find it for us! We chatted a bit then we proceded to check out the cave. TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3W0Z3_lost-our-marbles-by-the-cave
darkanimals	Found it	9/6/2012	We stumbled upon another cacher, Specter, who had the log in hand, so we didn't have to work too hard for this one. Sir Dreward III and I explored the area a bit and cooled off in the cave. This was fun; TFTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3W0Z3_lost-our-marbles-by-the-cave
Shoney1	Found it	9/4/2012	T F T C - - - F T F Shared with Chuck80196. WOW! this is a great location and an excellent first hide by Team Formant. As Chuck mentioned in his log we planned the night before to go for this one today and were about 6 miles out when another cache was published close to where we were when we started our caching day. We decided to keep on going for this one and arrived near GZ, parked and made the short walk in. We made it to the crest of the hill with a great view of the cave and began our search. My GPSr pointed about 35 ft away but Chuck's I-phone indicated we were close on top of the hill. Scanned the area for about 10 minutes when Chuck changed his course and went down and around the hill to the area my GPSr was pointing to. I followed but by the time I got down the hill but not yet around it I hear Chuck yell he had found it. It was time to celebrate and take some photos before heading to the other new cache. We appreciate your efforts in providing this cache for our enjoyment and taking us to this cool location.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3W0Z3_lost-our-marbles-by-the-cave
chuck80196	Found it	9/4/2012	FTF #535! OCW Shoney1. We knew that last night might be a bad time to try for this cache, considering the terrain and difficulty. We really wanted to see this one though because the description was quite a build up! So, we hatched a plan to make a go at it this afternoon. There were no find logs when we started toward Ash Grove so we were excited! Most know that we are FTF hounds so this one had all of our attention until a new cache published in Springfield! We were 6 miles from GZ so we kept on our path but were looking over our shoulders thinking about another cache.... We arrived at the parking area and hurried across the wooded area. Upon our arrival, we both said WOW! This is a really cool spot! We looked high and we looked low and we took pictures and we found a cache with a blank log! This is a great spot. There was no water today but I wondered how much water flows here under normal non drought conditions. Anyway, we enjoyed this spot and will recommend it to others! After a flurry of pictures, we scurried away to go for another FTF! Shared FTF with Shoney1. T4t$!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3W0Z3_lost-our-marbles-by-the-cave

Get your Cache Published Quickly: Cache Listing Requirements . . How to enable your geocache for further review. . . How to do EVERYTHING. STATUS UPDATE NEEDED Greetings, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last note or two, I see this cache might need a little attention. It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page. If it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache. If you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then. If you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database. When everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log removes the "needs maintenance" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute! I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future. HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS Respond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select "Post Note" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process. If you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.

train1904	Found it	2/5/2016	I think I got very lucky when I found this geocache. It appears that much of the fill from the great Christmas flood had washed away much of the soil so I found this geocache probably much lower than it originally was. When I opened it I found that the log was totally soaked. So I had a new baggie and dry log in my pocket. I replaced the log but left the old log in case the owner wants to see it.

scienceteacher42	Found it	12/24/2014	Riding my bike with My Dog Tsuki TB4GRZQ on the South Creek Trail, I saw someone looking around this area. I looked for this cache last summer, but the number of muggles on the trail and the brush in my way prevented me from finding it and I kept planning on looking for it this winter. I had a good idea where to look and so when I saw him looking around the corner, I told him where I thought it was and sure enough he found it easily. Luckily he was willing to share his pen with me so I could sign the log, but I did have my trackable dog for him to log.

sumpteretc	Found it	12/24/2014	This is more like Smurf condominiums. I was daunted by the huge number of hiding spaces, many of them filled with mud and leaves. I was about to give up when scienceteacher42 happened by on her bicycle. She asked if I had found it yet and suggested an area for searching that I had pretty much neglected so far. I worked that direction and, voila! there it was. I signed the log and then let her sign it. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC41Q91_smurf-cave--the-tribute

I arrived near GZ at the culled sac and thought I needed more exercise than that short walk so I parked across Battlefield in that building with all the no trespassing no loitering signs.....I know loving on the edge right?!? Walked up to GZ and remembered the first Smurf Cave and the giant rock that those little guys had to move to get into their home. Right in front there was a rock! That's the obvious place, right? Well, I'll let others decide for them selves. I like the set up a lot! Nice job! L2&AD! T4t$!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC41Q91_smurf-cave--the-tribute
Semipaw	Found it	11/22/2012	FTF #81. After a great Thanksgiving with the family at the house, the kids were getting restless and wanted to go somewhere. So I loaded the four oldest in the car and headed up here to this new cache. Of course, I knew right where this one was located. We parked in a lot nearby and made the short walk down the hill and along the trail under the highway to GZ. It was dark, so I had to use my flashlight to make the find. It took a few moments of poking around, but we got it. The kids enjoyed climbing around while I signed my name under the light of my flashlight. It sure was a warm evening, even with the little bit of rain in the area.

OrigamiFolder	Found it	11/24/2017	I'm a big fan of cave caches so this was a must stop for us. The whole family got in here and took a look around. I thought I was at least half way till further investigation proved it was much deeper than I original suspected. I got pretty muddy but it was so worth it. Thanks for the cache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC41RKE_lick-branch-cave

Triple_P	Found it	2/11/2015	Went to Piedmont to visit a friend of mine for the day. I saw this cache and thought it would be a cool place to stop and get the container. Her and I crawled all the way to the back of the cave/tunnel and didn't see the cache. We both turned around and she headed out and left me for the find. We did find the cache, but it wasn't "half way" back into the cave. The cache is maybe 5 feet from the entrance. Signed the log and moved on for the day.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC41RKE_lick-branch-cave
Fawnspots	Found it	1/17/2015	I am of fair height but was able to squat and shuffle to this one without getting dirty. Gloves would be beneficial though. Saw a cave cricket.

ThatGrif	Found it	8/4/2014	So 87preluede posted on the SLAGA website that he wanted to do a road trip to South eastern MO to place a new earth cache and he wondered if anybody wanted to join him. I asked if we could go after this cache. The reason for this was eravu posted a pic of this cache. We got to the cache site I got the Go Pro cam out and put on the head cam strap Preluede grabbed a flashlight, I probably should have got mine to but I didn't. The start was a little sketchy but after that it was great. Until I knocked off my cam and had to put it back on. I was videoing the entrance and must have gotten carried away as we ended up at the farthest point at the back of the cave. Looked around and went back to the front only to find the cache laughing at us. TFTC and the fun place to take some video This entry was edited by "The Grif" on Friday, 08 August 2014 at 01:59:33 UTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC41RKE_lick-branch-cave

Pastor G	Found it	7/5/2014	OCW Eravau during our annual Saturday caching trip on the Saturday of Camp Meeting at Fredericktown. I am still nursing a knee from arthroscopic surgery, so I did not want to go in. However, Eravau did not want to go back any further by himself, so I VERY carefully lowered myself in and crawled in . He did not have to go too far after I joined him before finding the cache. Very "cool" spot to be sure. Giving it a favorite point!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC41RKE_lick-branch-cave
eravau	Found it	7/5/2014	(#2,591) While we were staying in Cherokee Pass today... far from our homes in Franklin County, Missouri... Pastor G and I decided to do some cache hunting here in this part of southeast Missouri. We drove up to ground zero and parked... then took a couple of pictures outside the little hole in the rock hiding the cache. Since he's recovering from knee surgery... Pastor G told me I could go in and he'd wait for me. I was a little nervous about going into a dark hole in the ground alone... but in I went. It didn't look like it went much further than about 10 feet at first. But then I actually got inside. The cool air felt awesome after sweating through the 80 degree air outside to get in there. I shined my flashlight around to see how big the place was. It still didn't look much bigger... 'til I wiggled a littler further down. Wow! A hallway of sorts... and it looked like it went around 100 feet down and then opened up a bit. It was then that I started getting nervous about just how big of a creature could actually be hidden down in here. I called to Pastor G and asked him if he couldn't actually get in there with me without hurting himself. He reluctantly went back to the car for his gloves and light... and a few minutes later joined me in the hole. I had him post himself at the beginning of the "hallway" as I made my way down it to search for the cache. Just having another human in sight calmed my nerves enough to proceed. After a few minutes... my light fell on the cache and the smile hit my face. I twisted my arm around a couple of different ways before I could finally get a good hold of the container and bring it to where I could open it. After wiping the mud off my hands from opening the container... I pulled out the log. I took nothing from the container... but left my signature, one of my signature item and one of my double-sided Extagz. Then after putting the container back together and back in place... we spent a few minutes making a video of me extracting myself from the "hallway" and taking lots of pictures of the area. This is definitely some of the most fun I've ever had caching! Thank you [b]so[/b] much for placing this awesome cache, UrbanArcher! A well-deserved favorite point is coming your way.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC41RKE_lick-branch-cave

frogtoad	Found it	1/19/2013	Interesting place for a cache. Unfortunately I had not read the hint until this evening, or I would have hid it back where the hint said. I left the cache pretty close to where the hint says, but not exactly, as I wasn't aware of the correct hiding place. When I crawled to the end of the tunnel, I found a sign that said "firearms prohibited". It also looked like someone had made a small fire in the tunnel once, which didn't seem like a very good idea. I'm not sure if those are mosquitoes in there, but I did swallow one, whatever it was (I don't know what mosquitoes taste like) Thanks for the cache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC41RKE_lick-branch-cave

Note to future finders- plan to get dirty by scooting or crawling, don't go alone, and if you are tall like MarkSar, bring a shorter cacher with you to send in. Oh, and there really was a cloud of bugs on December 2nd! We parked a little past at an intersection. Thanks for the cache- a fave!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC41RKE_lick-branch-cave

If you wish to repair/replace the cache sometime in the VERY near future, just contact us (by email), and assuming it meets the current guidelines, we'll be happy to unarchive it.

*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	10/10/2017	STATUS UPDATE NEEDED OR POSSIBLY OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last few logs on this cache it appears that this cache may be in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... CACHE MAINTENANCE "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the ”NEEDS MAINTENANCE” attribute is showing you will need to do the following. CACHES THAT NEED MAINTENANCE Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and may be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I will be looking forward to hearing back from you soon. In the meantime your cache has been disabled.

Shortleaf	Found it	12/31/2013	Beautiful old cemetery. Not sure if my readings were off or what but my gps was telling me I needed to go another 150' into the field on the north... just happened to spot the cache by pure chance as I was contemplating whether or not I should cross the fence, which appeared to be private property. Forgot to bring a pen so I was unable to sign the log. Thanks for bringing us to this neat cemetery!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC44NMW_cave-spring-cemetery

nitsew	Found it	8/18/2013	Found this one before church today. I love that little cemetery/school house. I had been out that way a couple of years ago to get the other cache that is by the schoolhouse. So much history there. Thanks for giving me an excuse to head out that way again. I should have brought my Garmin GPS, as my phone had almost no signal. It said I was 130 feet off when I made the find. Luckily, we found it pretty quickly by just being observant. :) TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC44NMW_cave-spring-cemetery

chuck80196	Found it	8/6/2013	OCW Shoney1. We headed west on a possible FTF run! After coming in 3rd on one new cache and 2nd on the other we decided to hunt for a few more! Our trip took us through Carthage, Webb City and finally Joplin, just to name a few of the cities/towns we visited. 21 finds in all! The coords listed in the "note" are spot on! You should go ahead and change them. For those of you who read logs, it's not the cedar tree. Look a bit to the left, your luck will improve! Nice hide. The container blends very well. We spent considerable time here. Glad to have the smiley! L2$AD! T4t$! 8-06	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC44NMW_cave-spring-cemetery

MountainWoods	Needs Maintenance	5/4/2013	As other logs have mentioned, the listing coordinates for this GC are about 100 feet off. 30 might be acceptable if the CO's GPSr and the searchers' GPSrs were both off by 15 feet. But 100 feet is just too much. The coordinates on this GC need to be corrected. Please check them and do waypoint averaging for future searchers. Thank you.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC44NMW_cave-spring-cemetery
MountainWoods	Found it	5/4/2013	Thanks to topgun5403 & Co-Pilot Marty for the good coordinates. The listing coordinates definitely said that I would have had to cross the fence and go 100 feet into the next field. But I had seen the earlier logs and made a waypoint at the coordinates that they had given. They are pretty good. I also included my coordinates at the cache so that you can use them for waypoint averaging (along with those of topgun5403 & Co-Pilot Marty, and <i>new</i> coordinates that you take at the cache). SL Thanks.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC44NMW_cave-spring-cemetery

We did find though and we thank you for the cache in the area.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC44NMW_cave-spring-cemetery

Team AZMO	Attended	2/17/2013	We pulled into the parking lot to discover only one other cacher there. It wasn’t long before others showed up though. This was our first Flash Mob event. We weren’t sure what to expect but it was fun. We enjoyed meeting some new to us cachers. It is always nice to meet people who share your passion for the sport. The hike after the Flash Mob was fun. It was a long one but well worth it. What a beautiful area. Thanks Ozark Sweetheart for hosting this event. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work.

Also had my bike to do the OCCT trail, Tom Watson Hwy trail and the trail between Waukee and Minburn. I also stopped at a few Virtuals and Earthcaches on my way through North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa. Also found some random caches in different Counties. Thanks to all the CO for placing these for us to find and explore your area. The weather was hot and humid, but did not get any rain until Sunday morning in Watertown, SD. I replaced the wet logs and chewed up/damaged containers. I found most of the ones I was looking for. But had to leave a few DNF's. Thanks for placing these challenges on some great bike trails.

We’ve parted company with Miller and are grabbing counties and virtuals on our way back to Iowa. TFTC. SL. Thanks for placing this hide for my enjoyment, I really appreciate your effort!

glerby	Found it	5/27/2019	“Friends are as companions on a journey, who ought to aid each other to persevere in the road to a happier life.” - Pythagoras Many months ago, there was chatter about attending Geowoodstock XVII. Over the course of time, the chatter became an idea and eventually the idea became a plan. GeoWoodstock adventure 2019!! I pulled out of York, PA on May 20th, stopped to pick up NoBlueCircles in North Carolina, and eventually moocher2notyou in Texas. Over the course of 8 days; I traveled over 5,000 miles, completed a geotrail, a geotour, found the oldest cache in 10 states, celebrated my 2000th find, climbed trees, survived mosquito swarms and tick bites, hiked many miles, completed the GPS Adventures Maze, achieved 12 icons in one day, drove through huge thunderstorms, dodged tornadoes, and witnessed devastating floods. In the end, the journey wasn’t about the destination - it was about the experience, the fellowship, and the joy of sharing time with great friends. We notice this close by virtual after grabbing some gas and decided to stop. I had some ideas of what would be living in the holes, but I was wrong. Thanks for bringing us to this cool location.

The weather was good for most of the day, but we got to see first hand the severe flooding in Iowa that has been going on for over 70 days. Makes you appreciate what you have when you see how others are affected. Still we had a good day as we eventually started to head home to Pennsylvania. After getting gas we saw this one was close by so off we went. We guessed what would be living in those holes but we were all wrong. TFTFC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC474F_cave-homes
NoBlueCircles	Found it	5/27/2019	Greetings from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania! I found this cache while traveling on an epic twelve day, multi-phase geocaching road trip centered around attending GeoWoodstock XVII in Fort Worth, Texas! Over a very rewarding and packed 12 day period – I traveled with family, and then with friends, over 5000 miles through 20 states - successfully tackling many ambitious objectives. Some of the highlights included finding the oldest caches in 10 states, a GPS Adventures Maze, two geo tours, visiting Mingo, 7 webcams, 12 cache icons in a day, over 40 virtuals; as well as a smattering of gadgets, challenges, and other memorable and high favorited caches. Along with glerby and moocher2notyou, we traveled night and day through blazing sunny skies and torrential rain, and passed the time in the car with great conversations, many laughs, selected music, and plenty of fast food, snacks and coffee. We encountered dangerous tornado storms, witnessed devastating flooding, used a ladder to climb many trees, met ticks from all over the country, battled mosquito swarms, and visited many historic and interesting locations. From scenic hikes to quick park and grabs – we encountered the full spectrum of interesting cache locations, styles, and hide types. We had an amazing time throughout our journey – and experienced wonderful group fellowship and teamwork. We are very thankful so many details and aspects aligned perfectly to make this trip so memorable and productive! I spotted this virtual on the map along the route we were traveling, and we decided to make a quick pit stop. We pulled up alongside the road, took a photo of the location, and then I quickly walked through the knee high tick grass to gather the necessary information at the sign. Answer sent before logging.

Casper&Aero	Found it	5/8/2019	Troqueurs32 enverra la réponse sous peu.... Trojans32 will send the answer shortly Nous sommes partis très tôt hier matin de Montréal, le 7 mai, avec nos amis Troqueurs32 pour un périple de Géocaching qui nous amènera à visiter plusieurs endroits... Notre but premier était de participer au Geowoodstock au Texas mais comme on dit, tant qu'à faire le voyage pourquoi ne pas ajouter quelques jours, sinon quelques semaines et en profiter pour faire la découverte de plusieurs caches... Nous ciblerons les caches avec trois caractères, donc de vieilles caches, combler les mois de placement dans nos tableaux respectifs, faire des Webcam, Wherigo, Virtuelles, nous avons décodé plusieurs Géo-Arts sans oublier les caches traditionnelles, Earthcaches, Challenges, Letterbox, Multi, ce qui nous permettra aussi de visiter plusieurs États dont le Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma et le Texas... Hier, nous avons signé des caches dans le Missouri et le Kansas où nous avons fini notre journée... Il a certainement beaucoup mouillé avant notre arrivée puisqu'à certains endroits, le gazon était gorgé d'eau et il fallait être prudents lors de nos recherches.... Aujourd'hui, nous nous dirigeons vers Lincoln au Nebraske et voulions signer plusieurs Challenges... Mais avec toutes les inondations, nous avons dû changer nos plans puisque plusieurs routes étaient fermées... Nous avons donc débuté le Géo-Art Boys Drool que nous finirons demain... Nous signerons CATR32 tout au long de notre périple... CA pour Casper&Aero et TR32 pour Troqueurs32... Merci pour la création de ces caches qui nous permettent d'ajouter des sourires à notre profil, d'atteindre nos objectifs personnels et de passer du bon temps entre amis... Notre log sera le même pour toute la journée et s'il y a une particularité, nous l'inscrirons au début de notre texte... Nous ajouterons des favoris ici et là au gré de notre GPS... MPLC We left very early yesterday morning from Montreal, May 7th, with our friends Troqueurs32 for a geocaching journey that will take us to visit several places ... Our first goal was to participate in Geowoodstock in Texas but as we say, as long as 'to make the trip why not add a few days, if not a few weeks and take the opportunity to discover several caches ... We will target caches with three characters, so old caches, fill the months of placement in our respective tables , Webcam, Wherigo, Virtual, we have decoded several Geo-Arts without forgetting the traditional caches, Earthcaches, Challenges, Letterbox, Multi, which will also allow us to visit several states including Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas ... Yesterday, we signed caches in Missouri and Kansas where we ended our day ... It certainly wet a lot before our arrival because in some places the grass was waterlogged and we had to be careful when our research .... Today, we are heading to Lincoln in Nebraske and wanted to sign several Challenges ... But with all the floods, we had to change our plans because several roads were closed ... So we started the Geo-Art Boys Drool that we will finish tomorrow ... We will sign CATR32 throughout our journey ... CA for Casper & Aero and TR32 for Troqueurs32 ... Thank you for creating these caches that allow us to add smiles to our profile, achieve our personal goals and have a good time with friends ... Our log will be the same for the whole day and if there has a particularity, we will write it at the beginning of our text ... We will add favorites here and there according to our GPS ...

Boreal Walker	Found it	1/20/2019	I decided to take a week off of work in between some military obligations to explore the state of Missouri. I had it in my mind to complete the County and DeLorme Challenges. I came up with a route that would take me through all of the necessary counties that I needed with a short detour to grab a missing DeLorme page. The weather was cold and windy, but that didn't slow me down too much. I worked my way around in an east/west route through the state. I stuck mainly to the state highways, which allowed me to explore more of the country side. I ran across a lot of interesting sites and attractions. I meet quite a few nice people throughout my travels. Thanks to all the COs for placing and maintaining caches for me to find. It is greatly appreciated. I had an idea of what I would be finding here before I ever got here. I had been seeing the loess road cuts for a while now as I drove around the area. I pulled up and read the sign. Yep, that confirms it. TFTVC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC474F_cave-homes

By the end we had covered over 2200 miles while encountering snow, ice covered roads and some cold winds. The further South we got the better the weather became. The second half of the trip was about perfect for driving and caching! We really enjoyed the scenery along the way and the many nice places that these caches brought us. We loved that we could get the dogs out to stretch their legs at many of our stops. Thanks to all of the CO's for adding to our adventure.

*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	8/16/2017	STATUS UPDATE NEEDED or OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last few logs on this cache it appears that this cache may be in need of repair. If it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... CACHE MAINTENANCE "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the ”NEEDS MAINTENANCE” attribute is showing you will need to do the following. CACHES THAT NEED MAINTENANCE Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and may be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I will be looking forward to hearing back from you soon. In the meantime your cache has been disabled. Thanks for your understanding, Thanks, *gln, Mongo and Banjo-Boy Your Missouri Geocache Reviewers How to enable your geocache for further review. How to get your cache published quickly.

From the window of the MCU ML says she thinks I passed it up and as I turn and spot the cache I nearly blundered right into a patch of the wonderful green stuff. Not that I was too worried (yet to have a reaction myself) but I didn't want to spend the next few days scrubbing my skin off and sleeping with the puppies before ML would let me back in the house.

We really didn't plan on searching for any on this series except for one in Arkansas (to add a county) and then tried to get coords on our smartphones with spotty coverage. We finally managed 10 of them but in a haphazard order. Thanks for the hides.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4EFD8_scenic-highway-cave-road

My goal was to make it to #51 and ride the ferry across Bull Shoals. I drove so Sheri had opportunity to write her logs as we went. Mine will be a little more generic. L2$AD! T4t$!

Shoney1	Found it	6/17/2013	T F T C --- F T F. OCW Grunyan and Casey. Day #2 of my FTF quest on the Scenic Highway 125 series. Today's adventure began shortly after 3 p.m. when I called Grunyun to see if he wanted to make a FTF run. He was pretty excited and recruited his wife, Casey, to go along for the fun. After a few misdirected turns, we arrived in the area and began our adventure. This section of Highway 125 always reminds me of being on a roller coaster: sharp turns to the left, then the right, up a hill, down a hill, all within 1/4 of a mile, and it continues on, and on, and on. It was good to be able to stop every little bit to find a cache and take a break from the winding road. We worked very well as a team locating the caches, mainly in cedar trees. Is the cedar the state tree for Missouri, it should be! We saw many interesting panoramic Ozark Mountain views, along with many streams, on our three hour journey. Once again, thank you for all your hard work in placing this series. Looking forward to the third and final section being published soon!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4EFD8_scenic-highway-cave-road
Team Grunyun	Found it	6/17/2013	FTF #38 Shoney called me around 3:30 today letting me know that several caches had published on Hwy 125. After hearing tales of Mr. FTF getting over 20 caches the day before from this series, I jumped on the opportunity. He arrived at my house shortly after and my wife and I loaded up in geo truck and headed that way. Shoney's Garmin played a dirty trick on us and led us down many miles of rough backroads which at one point I'm pretty sure we drove through a river. We eventually made it to where we wanted to be and began our streak of 26 FTFs. I have never even found 26 caches in a day so this was quite an adventure for us. I think by the end of it, Shoney and Casey were tired of hearing me yell "Woohoo!" What a great day, we all had a lot of fun finding these caches and we appreciate all the time you have spent placing them for others to find. Sometime soon I will have to find the first part of this series on my motorcycle. Thanks again!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4EFD8_scenic-highway-cave-road

phenixcachers	Found it	2/10/2017	Hey buddy! Found while team caching with my cachin' buddies Train1904, Spiritguide, and Wherisitnow, on a big tri-state cachin' trip! I was excited when we pulled into this awesome place! I love caves! Heck, I have even explored a couple before! (The technical term for all you cave fanatics would be...."spelunking"---haha) I love the subterranean world of caves. From the cool crisp air, to the way cool formations, to the bats and other creatures, ...in short...caves Rock! (No pun intended)--haha. We all started searching different areas. Turns out three of us had been searching the wrong elevation...haha. Train had the correct elevation and found the cool ammo can! I didn't know what the hint meant before our search. But now that I know "where" the cache is hidden...I absolutely know what the cool, clever hint means! Never had heard "that" being called "Spanish daggers" before.....but I will have to remember that! Pretty cool! Man, we SO wanted to take a tour of the cave, but we were too late, they were closed! Thanks a bunch for the cool cache at this awesome place, buddy! This absolutely deserves a favorite point for the great hide, the container being a cool ammo can,and of course this awesome place!

WeBeTNT	Found it	1/21/2017	A few months back, Yellowdogs asked if we might be interested in heading down south to try and collect a few older caches along with some virtual caches "from way back". Normally heading south isn't our favorite direction since we prefer the cooler temps, but since the average temps for Oklahoma and Texas were in the mid 60's, we had a hard time saying "No" to the offer. The end result to our adventure was more than 150 finds across five days of travel, caching in four states, and 1,404 miles of driving. Thanks to all the CO's for taking the time to place all these caches! Our very first cache in Missouri! We made this waaaaay harder than it needed to be, but that's pretty much how we roll. Once the missus read the hint, we adjusted our search and happily made the find. (And felt pretty stupid, all at the same time.) As we were returning to our geotruck, a nice lady asked if we were Geocaching or if we were here for the tour. As much as we really wanted to take the tour, we were on a tight schedule to get back to Tulsa and had to decline the offer for the tour. Traded a trackable, dropping Forrest who would like to trave from cache to cache. Replaced everything as found once the log was stamped. Gets a favorite from us for being a "first" cache.

yellowdogs	Found it	1/21/2017	We stopped here while on a road trip with WeBeTNT while trying to visit a few states and counties along the way. We way over thought this one and if it was a snake it surely would have bit us! Stamped the log. Thanks for the cache! Sun Shining. Go Caching.

kvenator	Found it	5/30/2014	Wonderful day to go after a few hides. Met up with Doug_HollyNKC to tackle a number of caches in Pleasant Valley Park and had an enjoyable time on the trails. Then we took a break for lunch followed by a fun, casual stroll along one of the area power trails. We decided to call it a day after finishing the trail and I took a side trip after another area hide. Then, on what I had meant to be my route home, I unintentionally found myself at one end of another power trail. Hmmm... park and walk the ~2.6 mile round trip or head on home? Gosh, I'm here, might as well knock it out. Spend the next hour or so grabbing those as well before returning home. Quite a fun filled day. Thanks for adding to it. TFTC!

herbiekid	Found it	12/2/2013	Co-FTF !!!!! When I read the cache description about not for the faint at heart I chuckled. I have done some crazy things to sign a log, but this is near the top of the list for dangerous. If you are afraid of heights or breaking yourself in two stay clear of this one. But if impossible is your thing than this one will be just right up your alley. I enjoy a challenge, this goes beyond that. Ethan, Brent and Joel, you guys are nuts.....I like crazy !!!! Im going to give this one a Fav point because it truly deserves the 5 terrain raiting. Not just for the need of a boat, you need to be a little off to get this one.......OK a little more than a little. Thanks for the fun !!!!!!!

ThatGrif	Found it	12/2/2013	Well we drove almost 2 hours to get here and 10 miles of kayaking to get here for this cache. It did not disappoint at all. Herbiekid and I went up there with little trouble and once in the cave it was fun to look around and explore what was there. Then cam the really fun part getting back out and down safely. It was a little sketchy but we made it with arms and legs intact and no injuries. Thanks for such a fun hide.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4N4H1_extreme-cliff-cave

We did find it, but it was empty. No log, no swag, nothing. At least the info for the trail was there.

train1904	Found it	4/27/2016	I completed this earthcache this afternoon with Spiritguide who was in town on business. I have submitted our answers already. We saw the cave from across the creek and were able to estimate the answers . Water was flowing right on by after last night's rains, but there was no flooding.

I thought Mrs and Jr might want to swim at the hotel, but instead we went for a hike in this great park instead. Jr was hoping for a full blown cave to explore, but this is just a newbie! Another beautiful spot. A couple of walkers passed on while we were here. I read the cache page and we came up with our answers. I messaged the answers. On the way back we saw a family with a dog.

iPajero	Found it	7/17/2015	Enjoyed the short walk along this trail. It is hard to imaging the flood water level was so high while the stream was hardly flowing today. This one is really a 'newbie' cave. It will take millions of years for it to form to be an impressive cave. Our Travel Companion TB31M47 and Cache Mobile TB59EG4 came along for the ride. [b]Greetings from South Africa![/b] A bit on our background: At the outset of our holiday we had found 11656 caches (all done in southern Africa) and this is this first time we are caching on another continent. The logo on our 'all terrain' caching mobile reads "I would rather be lost in the woods than found in the city" and our travel companion TB has traveled over 195 000 kilometers achieving this milestone as we have explored the wide open and untamed expanses of southern Africa. It is, therefore, with some trepidation that we set out caching in the vast expanse of USA with its enormous cities and massive network of freeways in a first world country. Having overcome encounters with dangerous wild animals (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, hyenas and hippopotamus) in game parks, this does give us a degree of confidence that we will be up to any challenge the USA may have for us. A quote that we hold dear reads "Every morning you are handed 24 golden hours. They are one of the few things in this world that you get free of charge. If you had all the money in the world, you couldn't buy an extra hour. What will you do with this priceless treasure?". While in the USA we will endeavor to use the hours we have to discover as much of the country as possible and find some caches along the way.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC52VFX_newbie-cave

dj1974	Found it	7/15/2014	I've been planning to do the Earthcaches along this trail and the two at the museum above for awhile now. Today was a great day to be on the trail, mid-70's in the middle of July is hard to beat, so today was an excellent time to do these. This is a great part of the trail, and the stream along its side is very scenic. The water level was very low today allowing me to get right down into the stream and enjoy its beauty. Thanks for the science lessons.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC52VFX_newbie-cave

kimbotjr	Found it	5/17/2014	We'd been planning to spend some time in the Springfield area so I mapped out a few caches to visit while here. When outside our home area we'll typically focus on a few non-traditional caches, and being that we always enjoy earthcaches, this one was put on the list. It was a great morning for a walk along the paved trail, and the 3 earthcaches along here were perfect for increasing knowledge of the area. Required information has been sent.

nan-d1955	Found it	8/12/2016	Spiritwolf922 and I enjoy geocaching A LOT and carry spare cache containers in case we find a cache in need of repair. Most of the time when we find one that seems to be missing, we usually contact the CO to get permission to replace the cache so the hide can stay in the game. As Spiritwolf mentioned in her log, we were pretty sure we had the right 'concrete cave' and we replaced the cache. The CO may want to go out and camoflage the replacement, but for now it's got some natural camoflage that should help keep it hidden. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC53RM8_concrete-cave

MMaru	Found it	2/6/2015	Working on the Grave Hop cache brought me back here after a DNF last month. No ominous black dog in sight this time... too bad, I've decided to start bringing biscuits with me considering how many dogs I meet caching! :) Last time I was here, I got to the cemetery only to realize that I'd never loaded the cache onto my GPS! I hunted about anyway, but was unsuccessful, so I made sure when I got home to reload this one... or so I thought! It was still not showing on my GPS! Not to be deterred, I recalled a hint and dove in to look for it anyway! Thus began Maria vs. The Thorns: Round Two! I bellowed my mighty battle cry, but they were unimpressed and soon I was whimpering my pathetic battle whine and picking thorns out of my fingers. After strategically retreating, I used a stick to poke around and victory was mine! Thanks for placing and maintaining this cache! I'm glad I went back for it!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5EE3F_cave-springs-cemetery

darkanimals	Found it	1/21/2015	I made my way north from "Stop 81 & 60." I parked at the church and stopped to admire it before heading over to the cemetery. The notorious black dog was relaxing in the sun, but he only gave me a few lazy barks before drifting off again. I spent some time searching around the tree, focusing on what I thought was the best cache hiding spot. Once I expanded my search a little, I stumbled upon the little guy, signed the log, and explored the cemetery for a few minutes. Black dog (I'll assume hes a Zeppelin fan) didn't give me any trouble on the way back, and I headed for the FHT.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5EE3F_cave-springs-cemetery

MMaru	Didn't find it	1/17/2015	I knew I was in for a haunting search when I pulled up to this cemetery - there was a black dog lying calmly in the driveway. Ominous! After I parked, I turned off my auto GPS and took out my etrex only to find that I'd only loaded the coords into my auto and not my etrex! Shoot! Still, I figured it was worth a shot. I tried to recall as much about this cache as I could from memory and set off. Well, as per usual, my car GPS had me all over the cemetery. Except, of course, for where the cache is! I checked around this tree - what a cool sentinel! I also spotted another visitor to the cemetery. He wasn't very friendly, though - kept running away when I approached. Although I came up empty-handed on this one, I enjoyed the hunt and I love visiting cemeteries! Thanks for placing this cache and bringing me out here!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5EE3F_cave-springs-cemetery

train1904	Found it	10/21/2014	I was looking for this one - no dogs but a local drove over to see what I was up to. I said I was interested in Old cemeteries. So he proceeded to tell me the history of the church and the cemetery etc etc. So I walked down to the church with him and took some pictures. It was interesting. After he left I used PAF so I could get done and out of there quickly. A previous hider had hidden it real deep.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5EE3F_cave-springs-cemetery
OzarksJim	Found it	10/19/2014	Find #5574 and last of 2 finds on a beautiful October morning. After getting the FTF's on phenixcachers' "The Other White Meat" cache, I drove here to go looking for this one. I parked next to the church, took a picture of it and submitted it as a potential portal Ingress portal, then walked towards GZ. Boy, I must have really stirred up the dogs in the neighborhood this morning because I bet I could hear at least three of them parking (presumably at me). Once I got to GZ, the search was much tougher than I thought it would be. I could only find one spot that would be a good candidate to hide a cache, but I didn't see anything there. After making maybe 10 trips around the tree, something finally caught my eye in that hiding spot and it was the cache! SL. On my way back to my truck, as my sneakers got soaked from the dew-covered grass, I was greeted by a big black dog that was standing sort of between the cemetery and the church. It was barking very loudly at me and wagging its tail. I just hoped I could make it to the truck before its owners came out to see what all the ruckus was about. Fortunately I made it to my truck and drove away before any irate neighbors showed up. TFTC! ~OzarksJim - Willard, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5EE3F_cave-springs-cemetery

phenixcachers	Found it	10/8/2014	Hey ya cool cachin' dude! Man!--was I ever excited to see your cool new cache here at this cool/historic location! Its only 4.5 miles east of me! (Well as the crow flies and we know that old crow must be half blind because he never flies in a straight line...LOL) I have a bit of geo-cache-hiding history associated with this cool place. Hmmm..come to think of it I love caching so much...I ALWAYS have a geo-story to tell about nearly every cache I've found..haha (the dont call me the "great geocaching storyteller" for nothing, ya know) So gather 'round and let ole' Phenix tell ya all about his story...haha (yep you guessed it boys and girls...its "Phenix Geo-Story Time"..haha) and it goes a lil' sumthin' like this>>>>>haha Back in 2007 I had scoped this cool place out and knew it was screaming for a cache hide...haha I've always wanted to hide one here, mainly in part to the cool historic church thats got alot of local history behind it and cachers usually love local history lessons. I had a perfect spot picked out then (the big cedar in the corner which is NW of your cache) Just had hidden the cache and was starting to take coords, when from the house thats west of the church, comes along a noisy barking dog. He sure was raising a ruckus and giving me the what-for..haha Well I wasnt scared of him, but knew he was drawing attention to probably the other neighbors, so I chickened out on hiding mine and got the heck outta there...haha (After I left the cemetery I went around the corner to the Cave springs Bridge and hid another container there on the bridge, which is still there and active) so, long story short...I'm glad you hid yours here in the cool place that was screaming for a cache hide..haha Today. the geo-mom and I had errands to run in Willard, so that gave me what I like to call "the prime caching opportunity" to cruise out to here and find your cool cache! Last week, we were out at Asher Creek and found bluegillns new cache and I remember you said in your found log you headed south from there and "planted something" of your own..haha In my slightly obsessed/slightly crazed geocaching mind, I just KNEW you probably hid one here in the cemetery (and I was right) I was super excited to be able to find a cache close to the house because its not everyday a new cache pops up close to my house, unless its on the good ole FHT...which is only a couple miles from my house. Found your cool cache but when I approached the object and saw all of the many spots that could hide a micro---I kinda "gulped" and told the geo-mom..."this cache search may get a bit ugly">>>LOL Luckily tho, I found the well hidden cool cache not long after saying those words...haha After finding and replacing the cache, we enjoyed looking at the old headstones (like we always enjoy doing after finding cemetery caches). Speaking of old headstones, most of them (as far as death dates) date back to the late 1800's so there are some very old and very cool old headstones here. I sure am glad you placed one here, buddy and so close to the house! ( I am going on 9 years of caching at the end of this month) and I can tell you I always get super excited searching for and especially finding caches !) I call it the "thrill of the hunt"--and what a thrill caching is! I sure enjoy your caches and their locations, buddy! Keep up the awesome work! Cache on my friend....

mash4077th_jp	Found it	10/8/2014	FTF...I texted CharlesRude last night and asked if he was up for a early morning cache and he said "YUP". I had to work late and didn't get off work till 3am so I wasn't sure I could even get up in time. Well I got up and we hit the road at 5:30am. It was still dark when we got there so we found a place to park for a little bit. The church worked great for this. I set the alarm on my phone for 6:45am. We put our seats back and went back to sleep. The alarm went off and we looked around at that point I could see the cemetery from where we parked. So it must be light enough. We made our way to GZ and with the pic. we didn't need the GPS. We searched for a bit and then I came up with the prize. As I opened the container the top spot on the log was ours. TFTC & FTF SL and headed home to go back to sleep. FTF shared with CharlesRude.

As we took off from our truck we were happy to see some cleared areas to walk. Geohubby and I got to ground zero pretty quickly. Geohubby walked around to get a better look at the area while I stayed at my lowest point..3 ft. Why yes. There it is!! Good coords! Our stats say 127 earthcaches. Hope this all checks out!

Forest-Ghost	Found it	11/22/2016	Being a big fan of earth caches I had meant to go after this one a long time ago. I especially love the fact that the final is near a cave!! Walking over to Elbow cave, the woods came alive and I heard the birds chirping and saw the woodland creatures dart through the woods. It was a wonderful day to be out and in the woods.

RicknJoy	Found it	12/10/2014	I stopped for this cache as I was wandering around the Karst Plan looking at sinkholes. I suppose I should start calling them dolines, now, but I like the term "sinkhole" better! Anyway, when I checked before I left the house this morning, I discovered I had found and logged 191 Earthcaches during my caching career so far. I have at least one more now! TFTC!

ArtieD	Found it	12/8/2014	FTF! Last night, while doing nothing much at all, I was made aware of a new cache in a new area of Columbia. Nice! I figured someone would go for it, but maybe not, since it was dusk. Maybe tomorrow I'll get it, I thought. Well wouldn't you know it, another cache popped up...and another! Now that's what I am talking about! Three new caches in a new area! So, with that in mind, I set myself up for a morning adventure with the hope of getting a FTF hat trick as well! I found this one while doing the EarthCache, since it was along the most logical route I plotted for myself. [b]If you count the new EarthCache here, I qualify with 105 EarthCache finds.[/b] I found ground zero just fine, found the cache container with ease and was greeted by a pristine log book! I dirtied it up with my signature, took the travel bug to move on, put everything away and continued on with my EarthCache duties. Thanks for the challenge!

beladi1	Found it	6/5/2018	I joined up with Iamgrateful to grabbed some caches in the upper part of Cliff Cave Park. First time on the new trails. Last cache in the park. It was a 6 tick day and lots of fun.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HQVP_welcome-to-cliff-cave-park
Iamgrateful	Found it	6/5/2018	OCW beladi1. I am grateful for my friend Marilyn eh. We met up at 9:30 am and had a terrific day caching the upper part of Cliff Cave. Such a cool park...nice new trails...but amazing quiet old trails that I like better eh. This was one of the cool caches we found. Thanks for the fun. Every cache is exciting....a new location, a new experience and a new adventure. It's magic. I am grateful. Thanks for helping me keep my streak alive, thanks for my daily dose of happiness, Tftc and Cheers from Canada eh ;-)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HQVP_welcome-to-cliff-cave-park

vorlon40	Found it	5/19/2018	On my way back to the car I had to pick this easy one up. I felt bad walking across the newly covered areas alongside the new path but I tried not to make too much of an impression. TFTH. My first trip to Cliff Cave Park. I brought my bike to use for the lower half but just barely finished much of the upper half before I ran out of time, the weather started to turn bad and I got tired (after 4 hours and 7.5 miles of hiking). Well, hiking may be a misnomer. There was a lot of bushwhacking since the old trails seem to have gotten harder to find with the new trail construction and the new ones didn't show up on my GPS map. Some of the old trails are so overgrown they are really impassible. I'll have to come back for a 2nd trip. #1540, 16th of 16 found today.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HQVP_welcome-to-cliff-cave-park

Triple_P	Found it	11/17/2017	Drove through the night from my home state of Ohio to St. Louis, MO this morning. I'm here visiting some friends in the Potosi and Farmington area today and Saturday. It's a cool fall day with a small breeze from time to time. The woods were bare making these caches easy to spot. I saw some of them from the trail. It's a breath of fresh air to see the cache owner maintain their caches. That's something people in Cincinnati don't do. Happy to locate all the ones on the bike path. I'm hitting the wooded trail this after for another 11. TFTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HQVP_welcome-to-cliff-cave-park

tree.	Found it	8/20/2017	I was in Missouri for a few days to see the total solar eclipse with htl. While in the area, we thought we would grab some Geocaches too. We went for Cliff Cave Park at first because it looked like a good spot to pick up quite a few, however this ended up being the only cache that we found in the park. The other caches were not positioned how we thought they would be and given how punishingly hot and humid it was, we opted for some alternatives. Nonetheless, we were glad to find at least one here and take in some views of the Mississippi. Thank you for the cache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HQVP_welcome-to-cliff-cave-park

molldoll123	Found it	6/19/2017	My group struggled for awhile to find the right path, but once we did we found this cache pretty easily. I think this is a great cache location for beginners and after only finding "AngryBird Series" caches it was refreshing and opened my mind to different places caches may be hidden.

avrillavignefan2	Found it	6/19/2017	After heading south by the river for our first few caches at Cliff Cave Park, my group and I found this one on our way over to the westernmost trail of the park. At first we walked past the cache and had to work our way back. There was construction going on around it but it was in a spot where the construction itself wasn't being done.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HQVP_welcome-to-cliff-cave-park

gosswow427	Found it	6/13/2017	Some construction around the park led us up a brutal hill only to find that we had completely overshot this cache's location.

Gusisking	Found it	6/13/2017	At first, my team and I hiked up the hill that this cache sits at the bottom of. Don't hike the hill!

PROBOB	Found it	10/15/2016	Flew in to KC from Michigan yesterday and cached my way to St. Louis for today's Geocoinfest mega event. I met up with ACLCoordinator, lincolnsaunt and Detour429 there and we did some post-event caching together. The 3 of them actually found this one yesterday, but didn't mind making a quick stop so I could run over and sign myself in too. TFTC!!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HQVP_welcome-to-cliff-cave-park
C4!	Found it	10/15/2016	A wild and wooly weekend at Geocoinfest 2016 with L7!, the weasel and croling. The weather was beautiful, and the caches were plenty. We signed most logs as "Team F'real" to save space in the logs. Thank you for your contribution to our wonderful weekend!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HQVP_welcome-to-cliff-cave-park
croling	Found it	10/15/2016	Team F’real (The Weasel, C4!, and L7!, and I) met up headed down to Geocoinfest in St. Louis this weekend. The weather was a bit warmer than we were expecting, but that wasn’t going to slow us down. We started the day grabbing some quick park and grab caches on our way to Cliff Cave Park. We saw that this trail had some caches with nice favorite points, so we decided to give it a shot. This turned out to be a really great trail! (Although we really wished we would have had our bikes with us!) The trail was very scenic, there were a lot of great cache containers, and most of the caches were in great shape! After completing the caches along this trail, we decided to head to the main event - Geocoinfest! We toured the City Museum, checked out the vendors, and visited with some other cachers. Afterwards, we headed out into the city grabbing any cache that crossed our path. Lots of park and grabs, but we also visited a few parks in the area. We ended up the day with just over 100 caches and a handful of DNF’s. Great day of caching in my book! Thanks to all of the CO’s that have placed and maintained these caches!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HQVP_welcome-to-cliff-cave-park
The Weasel	Found it	10/15/2016	Out with Croling, C4!, and L7! aka "Team Freal" for a fun filled weekend at Geocoinfest. The weather was perfect for grabbing all sorts of smileys. We prepared well in advance solving puzzles and picking out caches we wanted to grab for this weekend. We completed a few geoarts, several puzzles, some WIG's, some multis, some letterboxes, and of course some tradtionals. In the end, we rounded up around 250 caches and some great stories along the way. Geocoinfest was a blast. I'm glad I left my wallet in the car otherwise I would have gone braoke buying coins. For the eartcaches and virtuals that were found that needed to have answers sent to the CO's, those have been sent by another member of our group. TFTC!!!

Didn’t take too long for it to dissipate though once she was in front of the air conditioner. There were about a million grasshoppers out here and they were very loud.

Really cool looking cave and protection system that has been errected. Thanks for taking me to see this really nice area. Answers emailed for another great earthcache! Had to bring the wife to Springfield-Branson National Airport (SGF) for some testing and an interview...while I was waiting was able to grab some local caches. Loved exploring the backroads around the airport and making some finds. The ticks were definitely out in force and I had to keep removing them from my pants. Thanks for placing caches for me to find!

I had never explored this part of the conservation area, and I enjoyed the stroll down to Watkins Cave. It's a shame we can't go into the cave, but bat preservation is more important. Thanks for setting up this earth cache; I hope to get your others in the Springfield area, too!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HXQ1_watkins-cave
kimbotjr	Found it	1/10/2015	Came up with a cache list to work on while spending part of the weekend in the Springfield area. I started the morning off at 7 (to be read as 7 degrees) and made approximately 40 cache visits on caches that peaked my interest - mostly higher D/T ratings, non-traditionals, and caches with large containers. Nice location for this earthcache. It was a frosty trek over to it, but fortunately is was a short trek. Email with required information has been sent. Thanks for placing.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HXQ1_watkins-cave
topgun5403 & Co-Pilot Marty	Found it	1/10/2015	Find #11,019. Finally getting a chance to get out and do a little caching and taking advantage of the nice day. Nice walk to GZ and a little deja vu once there. We don't remember the name of the cache but there was a traditional here and the container was a magnetic key case attached to the frame. When reading the description and the requirements, we knew exactly where we were headed. Another fun and educational experience. Email with the required information haas been sent. Thanks for your efforts in placing this cache and being a part of our day. Topgun5403 & Co-Pilot Marty Springfield, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HXQ1_watkins-cave
phenixcachers	Found it	12/26/2014	Got a surprise call from my buddy train1904 and we had a great cache talk! It was great hearing from my buddy since its been a month and a half since I seen him and/or heard from him. We started having a great cache talk, and I mentioned if he knew this cool Earthcache was practicall in his backyard..haha He said he knew but hadnt cruised the short mile over to the parking lot for the area and Cave. Watkins Cave is close to my house too ( 6.3 miles as the crow flies--but in all reality its more like 9 miles because we cachers know---that darn crow NEVER flies in a straight geo-line..LOL) We both didnt have anything going on for this morning, so train asked me if I wanted to drive over and meet him in the parking lot so we could tag-team this cool earthcache! I was super excited to do so! I love hiking the trails here in the BDCA and have hiked the trails around the cave for several years now, especially on caching hikes! When I got to the parking lot train was there and after he gave me my awesome Christmas present, we immediatly hit the trail and hiked towards the cave. We carefully did each stage and enjoyed the cave. It sure would be cool to be able to explore it! After getting all the required answers, we started heading back to the parking lot. Train said he would send the required answers for both of us (which he has done). We sure enjoyed our visit to Watkins Cave and really enjoyed your cool Earthcache setup! You, my friend, are the local Earthcache Master---and I have alot of geo-respect for you for that! Hope to chip away at more of your local Earthcaches in the coming New (caching) Year! Thanks a bunch for this cool Earthcache! Happy (Caching) New Year! Cache on my friends.... Scott (phenixcachers)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HXQ1_watkins-cave
train1904	Found it	12/26/2014	This earthcache is less than a mile from my house and I have visited the cave numerous times on geo-runs. I'm just getting over the stomach flu so I had talked to Phenixcachers to wish him Merry belated Christmas. So we agreed to meet up and do this earthcache. Was a great day to be outside, or at least it was when we were there. We walked to the cave, not needing to use the gps. We had a tape measure with us which came in handy. We took our time getting the answers and saw things we had never noticed before - earthcaches do that and that's why I like them. I'm glad you set this up to bring folks to this interesting spot. I have emailed the answers for both of us. I'll add a picture as well as a fave point. Thanks.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HXQ1_watkins-cave
OzarksJim	Found it	12/17/2014	Find #5605 and FTF #222. I did this Earthcache this morning before going to work. The conservation area's hours, according to their web site, are from 4 am to 10 pm, so I know I was here during "legit" hours. I wore a second coat since the temperature was hovering around the freezing mark this morning, and I'm glad I did, because it was really chilly. This cave is only 3.5 miles from my house, and I have been here several times before. There used to be a regular cache (GC1RBYY) located about 34 feet from the Earthcache coordinates. I also came to this cave with my son's Cub Scout den back when he was a Wolf cub. However, despite all the times I've been here, I've never been inside the cave. (I'm not sure I would want to though--I'm rather claustrophobic). I was able to get all the answers to the best of my estimabilities and have emailed the cache owner. Thanks for another great Earthcache! ~OzarksJim - Willard, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5HXQ1_watkins-cave

cjhoffy	Found it	11/13/2017	My husband is out of town for a week, the library was closed Friday for Veterans Day and this weekend wasn't my weekend to work. So I took today off, too. I used this opportunity to work on some local challenges in Arkansas. My main goal was to get 6 Virtuals, and the Arkansas State Star Geoart. There are several others I will be working on as well. I completed the Arkansas State Star yesterday and got the last of the Virtuals I needed yesterday, too. Now it's time to head home and get a few caches on the way for other challenges. Thanks for sharing this cave. I needed three more Earthcaches for a 7 x 100 challenge. Answers have been sent. cjhoffy from Lenexa 2:31:00 PM	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5NTPC_turnback-cave

train1904	Found it	10/10/2015	I had been meaning to do this earthcache for many months but just never got around to it. Now I'm glad I waited because I had it to use on souvenir day. Another reason for doing it now is that the corn is been harvested and it is a clean hike across the field. I also checked on my Cliff geocache which I found in excellent condition. I then got the cave answers and have submitted them already. I'll add a selfie that doesn't show the cave and will add a fave point. Thanks for this geocache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5NTPC_turnback-cave

topgun5403 & Co-Pilot Marty	Found it	3/21/2015	Find #11,284. Taking advantage of a nice day to do some caching around the Springfield area and stopped in here. Easy walk across the field as the warm weather had done a good job of drying things out. There used to be a regular cache out here some time ago, so we knew exactly where our journey would end. Once at GZ, we made our observations and tried to peek down into the cave as best we could. Looked like things dropped off pretty quickly once you would have gotten inside the opening. We enjoyed the learning experience and giving this one a favorite vote as well. Thanks for your efforts in placing this cache and being a part of our day.

kimbotjr	Found it	3/17/2015	Took advantage of today's nice weather to visit a few caches in Missouri. The total finds at the end of day wasn't high, but the quality of caches was good and many of the locations provided some added interest and/or fun to our searches. We had been to this area on a previous occasion but there appeared to be hunting occurring that day, so we decided to return another time. Fortunately, that delay allowed for this earthcache to be added. Email with required information has been sent. Great location for an earthcache, thanks for placing.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5NTPC_turnback-cave
Mesozoic	Found it	3/7/2015	Today was set to be a nice day today so we set out for an adventure and found it with a new earthcache that had been published the day before. I knew the area but had never been over to this area before. With the fresh snow melt over the flowed field it was going to be a MUDDY mess. Unloaded the kiddos and where did they go? Straight running, like a couple of puppies that had been cooped up inside for a day, right into the mud fields of hell! I showed them a “back way” to get to the area, and so after a course adjustment it was through the woods and over the ditch to the earthcache we go. Once we got to area we preceded up the small incline and our smallest picked up a warrior princess attitude as we climbed up the hill. It was funny as hell to watch. We made our observations and sent them to the CO at 11:00 AM and then went around the area in search of some more caches in the area.

Mesozoic	Found it	5/1/2015	Who grew up watching cool Saturday morning cartoons? Captain caveman September 10, 1977 to June 21, 1980. "Captain CAAAAAVEMAAAAAAANNNN!" The one who did the voice of this character was none other than “Mel Blanc” AKA the man of a 1,000 voices, what a talented person, long departed from this life. Technically a cave “natural underground space large enough for a human to enter” it’s deep enough :-) This is a neat area the babbling brook adds a touch of peacefulness to the area. I would have NEVER of know it was here without geocaching and you placing a cache here. Blue ribbon of favoritism well-earned here.

dc2swhill	Found it	4/24/2015	{*FTF*} TFTC! FTF #39. My last FTF was on 6/30/13! I just don't pay much attention anymore. When I get a notification they have been too far away or I haven't been around. Today I used a vacation day before I lost it so I headed out to grab some caches before the rain. I wanted to start with the furthest away from the house which for some reason was in south Ozark. It was about seven miles a way from the next one on the GPS. I was sitting at Glenstone and Chestnut when the email came out. I didn't get in much hurry. I cant anyways the top speed of the truck is about 55-60. Much to my surprise the log was blank. Making the find wasn't too bad but I bet its a mess after a rain. Right at the mouth of the cavern was some fur. Some var-met was a meal for (humum clearing throut) CAPTAIN CAAAAAVE-MAAAAAAAN!!!!! It was cool to see Mr. Shoney. I'm sure he doesn't get beat out on a FTF run very often but I just happened to be on the road. Thanks for the fun.

Back in 2010, the OLR was the very first time we found caches using a GPS instead of a phone. We picked up this wonderful Wherigo on our way home. It was a great time traveling through the area learning the history and seeing the sights. We had to interrupt someone while we were looking for this cache, but he enjoyed visiting with us about this crazy hobby. SL.

train1904	Found it	11/9/2016	I had to be in Joplin this morning for my mom's cardiologist appointment. It went well and I had a little time so decided to do this wherigo. Everything worked well and I found the final without any difficulty. Thanks for the distraction.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC60X0C_historic-joplin--crystal-cave
chewysfolks	Found it	9/27/2016	Our first Wherigo, out tonight with Wood-n-block. Thanks to them for showing us the ropes of Wherigo. Now it makes sense. Thanks for the history lesson.

sarahjanel	Found it	6/28/2016	I am surprised the tourist business was not enough to keep this open. Maybe one day. Thanks for telling us about it and just thinking about what was under us was kind of cool. Glad the phones held out for us to complete the wherigo. I usually do not have much luck with them but today I did. TFTW SL	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC60X0C_historic-joplin--crystal-cave
afoolisharrangement	Found it	6/28/2016	SarahJanel and I were travelling from Oklahoma to Missouri for a couple of days of intense geocaching. We don't have many Wherigos back home in Oklahoma, so we try and do them when we can. This story was very fascinating. Don't you wonder what this giant room of crystals would be like?! I wonder how many places like this exist in the world, but are inaccessible. Thanks so much for the interesting history/geography lesson and the Wherigo!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC60X0C_historic-joplin--crystal-cave
nochange	Found it	6/4/2016	Mamaluvsracin and I decided to celebrate our anniversary by caching the Joplin area since it's been a while! Wish the cave was still open for tours it sounds like a really cool place! Thought I knew where this was going to take us but I was wrong. Had to make one detour bc phone and satellites weren't cooperating but finally got the smiley! Found with Geooh Live	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC60X0C_historic-joplin--crystal-cave
Mamaluvsracin	Found it	6/4/2016	Out on geocaching date with nochange. Celebrating 18 years of marriage. I would have loved to live in those times and get to experience the cave for myself. I bet it was beautiful down there. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC60X0C_historic-joplin--crystal-cave
VikingChris	Found it	5/4/2016	I use the dentist nearby and wondered if there'd be a geocache there sometime, maybe I should've investigated and I could've bypassed the whereIgo. But then I would've missed out on the information about the cave. I halve to admit I drove in circles a little bit and any muggles nearby might have seen an odd cat circling the block. I was a bit paranoid as I know people getting their teeth worked on have a clear view of Ground Zero. Thanks as always for placing in maintaining this where I go	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC60X0C_historic-joplin--crystal-cave
wood-n-block	Found it	4/8/2016	This is really interesting. It would be great to have seen it in it's prime. We give this our favorite vote.

Once at the final it was a quick trip out in the cold. :-) I got confronted by a muggle at the final. He wanted to know if I had any drugs. I got back in the truck and took off. I appreciate your efforts in placing this cache for our enjoyment. Good job and I had a fun time finding it.

Cloak.n.Dagger	Found it	2/12/2016	Love the history, isn't there a museum around here for the cave? I could have sworn there was one...the wig was great but the cache container must have been muggled as only the log baggie was remaining...so I gave it a new fresh real Geocaching log and a cloak.n.dagger style container.

chuck80196	Found it	10/28/2015	I had an unusual Wednesday off work and it coincided with my wife's Bunco night with the girls. So, guess what I did. Yep, I went caching! I had to do some maintenance on one of my caches in Mt. Vernon so I decided to go for the unknown cache there and then head to the Joplin area. On the evening, I grabbed 1 multi cache, 5 Wherigo caches, 3 traditionals, 1 unknown, and 2 letterbox hybrids! I cached in both Missouri and Kansas. I had a great time! Wow! This is very intriguing. It would be really cool if they opened it back up! This one took a few minutes to find. Cache is in good shape. Thanks for the adventure! L2$AD!

bucknuts	Found it	9/27/2015	[blue]With outdoor cycling season over, it's time for some college football and caching trips. I get about 1 free caching weekend a month with the other weekends filled with college games. Last week I was at the MIZZOU game and enjoyed the state so much that this time I had The Bride come join me for a fun weekend staying with some friends in Springfield MO. I just got my GeoJeep back a few weeks ago and this was going to be a true test for it. I was just amazed how well the car is driving. One of the things I have come to enjoy about caching in Missouri is that there are not a lot of gravel roads. Matter of fact the entire trip in Missouri we never went on a gravel road, being from Iowa most of our caching trips are on gravel roads. The Bride and I left on Friday afternoon and cached once we got to the greater Springfield area. Cached until it got too dark (or when I couldn't find them in the dark). Met up with our friends we were staying with and went out for dinner. The next day The Bride and I got up early to do some of the wherigos and others in the area. We cache from sunrise to about 630, Then we went downtown and watched the MIZZOU game on television. That outcome was not what we wanted for sure. I was told we were going to the Tiger Club bar. I walk in and the only people in the place were Buckeye fans, this is my type of place. Watched the game and then headed back for a good nights rest. Got up Sunday morning and cached over to the Joplin area in the morning and afternoon and then headed back to the 515. This was my first trip ever to this area and changed up my normal routine. Normally, I would have gone after all the great challenge caches and the bike trail around the city. Instead this time I focused more on all the great wherigos placed in the community. I will definitely return again to come back for the challenges and to do some biking. Matter of fact me being off my bike for just a couple days to do this caching trip is a long time for me. I did leave my signature [red]bucknuts pencil in a few caches that I was able to do so. For me this turned out not to be a normal big numbers weekend as I only got 60 caches and DNF'd 8 others. I did do the oldest cache in the Springfield area and it was amazing. Thanks for all the great caches in the area. I really appreciate the wherigos and the time and effort that goes into building them. I've made over 40 of them myself and know the extensive work it takes to make them work well. For me I truly appreciate the effort that goes into building them. Thanks for the cache-signed log.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC60X0C_historic-joplin--crystal-cave

Barramus	Found it	9/15/2003	The hardest part for this one was finding the correct parking place. It was a quick hike to the cache, about .22 miles. But the last 75 feet are steep.

Soldiers of Fortune	Found it	9/14/2003	Another awesome cache by Butch. I nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw the cache. Some interesting aviators were found in the area.

After finding the cache, we spent some time in the cave analyzing what was going on in the dirt; bird footprints? Tyler played with the antlion traps awhile. Great view.

Trekkie79	Found it	3/20/2016	Took a few minutes after church today to grab a few of the new caches that have popped up in the area. I haven't been back in this area much in the recent years, though 20 years ago was a different story as I worked in these building for six years. So I parked right in front of a couple of these caches and took regular walks by them all Thanks for the smiley down memory lane.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6DA0G_penny-southwest-yellowstone-cave-

jadefalcon	Found it	3/14/2016	This last one was the easiest of the bunch. However, as I was walking through the parking lot from the other nearby cache, I was approached by someone in a vehicle asking if I was just walking around. Yup However, this always makes me uncomfortable knowing security is nearby and I am being watched. Found this thankfully in short order and replaced as found. Thanks for the fun cache title. Note for future finders - please do not park in the lot directly adjacent to the cache to the east - it looks like it is either being used for an impound lot or some sort of auction site. Park near the hotel to the north or somewhere else. TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6DA0G_penny-southwest-yellowstone-cave-
wanderfish	Found it	3/14/2016	We were actually caching in Leavenworth when my cell went off alerting of four new caches only 15 miles away. We thought with 4 we had a good chance to get at least one ftf. However once we entered the COORDs for the area our 15 miles turned into a 40 minute drive. We thought, what the heck and went for it. After getting 2 FTF's across the way we ran into LSOT&JillC who had already got FTF on this one. Oh well, 2 out of 4 ain't bad for either of us plus it's always nice to meet new cool geocachers and fellow Jeep owners! We are still recovering from over six miles of hiking at Kill Creek Park yesterday. Today, we decided to head toward Leavenworth for some easier caches...(hopefully less walking). We figured with the storm that came through last night we'd let the trails dry up a bit before heading back out that way...(well, that's our story and we're sticking to it). There are a couple of Battleship caches in the area too since we are still working on that series which we started wayyyy back in the day. This was our 17th find of the day around 2pm on a beautiful 71 degree and mostly sunny (now that the fog has burned off) Monday, March afternoon.

cjhoffy	Found it	1/10/2017	I had hoped to spend most of today caching. I didn't even need to make dinner tonight. The hubby and daughter both had other plans. But the wind was deceptively cold today. I didn't dress quite warm enough. I'd had enough of the bluster by 1:00 and decided to go home and run some errands and get a few things done at home instead of putting those things off for another day. I managed to find 9 caches before giving up. Thanks for a quick one. "Southeast" takes care of one last word I needed for a challenge, but I still need an icon that's not Traditional or Virtual. I've finished the challenges the other words could work for. cjhoffy from Lenexa, KS 11:21:00 AM	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6WQV7_southeast-sea-welcome-to-gasville-cave-slug-dollar

Great time of year to visit this area as the bushwacking and stream crossings were particularly forgiving. A side trip to Green's Cave was an awe inspiring bonus. Great day and a fun group...TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
Strider	Write note	1/31/2015	Wow, it's been almost 10 years since I found this with a great group of friends and today I was back with another bunch to find this one again. I brought along a repair kit and a replacement log for this cache and it shouldn't have any trouble with wet logs anymore. But the old log was damaged beyond saving. I was very happy to see that one of my signature items was still in here though. Thanks Butch, [b][i][green]Strider[/b][/i][/green]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
ThatGrif	Found it	5/21/2014	Well I set out on my adventure today to find this cache. I tried to meet up with the cache owner this morning and borrow his UV light for the day but to no avail we couldn't find it. So I went off with the knowledge I may not be able to get it but there was another cache there I wanted to get so all and all it would be a good day. I get to the parking and see Bullet Holes in the sign and parking, Welcome to The Park huh! I get a quick pic of the neat old furnace at the start. Then on to my starting point, pass a small cave on the way up then complete the task to show me waypoint 2. Im thinking to my self I need a machete to get through all these thorns. If you don't want a bushwhack this cache isn't for you, there is a small horse trail that you can sometimes find. I found a few more waypoints then of course comes the UV part!!!!!! The piece I don't have owell I booked it from here to the old archived cache and got a 6.8 mile hike in and one find so I didn't leave empty handed. The ticks are crazy like little armies I would scrap a leg off then they would be on the other leg. Started at 0800 and ended at 1330, then got home just before the rains hit. All and all it was a good day and I will be back to find you Woodswalker Cache So for this cache I found the cache easy enough after not getting the information at waypoint 4 that I needed to go onto waypoint 5. I don't know how in the world I can find a geocache but not find a 150 cave in the cliff?????? I looked and looked but just couldn't find the cave looking back and some of forrest ghosts pictures a see where it was hidden and where I need to go the next time. After I find Woodswalker I will find the cave too	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
eravau	Found it	5/17/2014	(#2,475) I was out in this southern part of Meramec State Park today with major134 in order to place the waypoints of a multicache I had built. This carried us over 5.5 or 6 miles of bushwhacking through the woods... up and down the beautiful hills... along and across the creek at the bottom. At one point in our hike we were passing right by this cache (or at least within a few hundred feet)... so we couldn't help but stop and check on it. I had heard about this cache from Forest-Ghost a couple of months ago... well after I had been out here for my scouting trip for my multi in December. So I had missed my chance when I was out here the first time. But then he made his way out here a month ago when I didn't even know about it and confirmed that it was still here... and since I was there today... there was [b]No Way[/b] I was going to miss out on a great old Butch cache. We didn't find it where we initially looked... but after working our way around some of the rock outcroppings and doing a little butt-sliding on steep dirt... we were soon at ground zero... and the cache was in an obvious spot. major134 dumped out some water (the bag was full) from the log back in the cache... and then provided a baggie for the makeshift log left by Forest-Ghost. We left our signature on the log... and I left one of my signature item for someone to find in the future. Thanks for a great, old cache with an awesome view below, Butch!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
Major134	Found it	5/17/2014	Eravau called me and wanted me to be his guinea pig on his new multi in Meramec State Park, so I headed to all the coordinates and performed the calculations, it's going to be a great multi. Along the way, Tony mentioned this old archived cache that Forest Ghost had just found after nine years. We passed right buy it. I remember Ghost talking about it and I said we've got to get it. Sure enough, it was there. It was difficult getting to it, but we made it. We put the make shift log in a plastic bag and added some paper and Eravau's pathtag. Hopefully more cachers will come for it, it is a dandy, much like his Onondaga SP2. Thanks for the cache, if you still get these notices. Definitely a favorite.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
curlycue109	Found it	4/18/2014	I can't give a better description of the adventure than Forest-Ghost, so I will just say a sincere thank you for such a wonderful day of exploration and discovery that I would never have experienced if not for hunting this geocache. Few things give the same feeling of coming around that trail along the river and looking up to see the beautiful, towering cave and trickling stream. This was an experience I will not forget!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
Forest-Ghost	Found it	4/18/2014	After nine years I am happy to report that Green Cave Overlook III is still here. I had originally been planning on going on a float trip on the meramec river with a friend yesterday but the floating part did not work out. I had my eye on this old archived cache for a very long time and it looked like a really neat hike so we decided to make the long trek. This was by far and away one of the coolest caching days I have ever had if not the best. We parked down at the old iron works and made our way up through the woods. We stayed along the creek but found that in many places the old trail had disappeared so we were bushwhacking through thorn and briars through much of it. The views, wild life and perfect weather made it all completely worth it. We saw many different types of birds along the way also a big black snake and an enormous deer. I had read the cache page but I don't think anything really prepared me for how amazing Green Cave really is. It was worth it alone just to see the cave. With the 150 ft ceiling it was truly a spectacular view. This is one of the coolest missouri caves I have seen to date. After finding the cave and spending some time there we headed back down the trail to find the cache. I did not realize initially that this one would be so far off the path to the cave area. I was very thankful for the hint for I would have probably been searching in the wrong area otherwise. We eventually found a route of attack and made our way to gz. This was a really spectacular view up here. After reaching ground zero I fumbled around different hiding spots for awhile until I finally made the climb further down onto the lower area where I spotted this nice large cache right away. It was shear jubilation at this point. There really is nothing sweeter than finding an old Butch Cache. This was the best of the best, a real adventure and tons of fun. The cache was filled with water so we emptied it out and I dropped in a new log (all I had for paper was a Cahokia mounds pamphlet). Our log is on pg. 11 if it is able to stay dry. I wish I had brought a regular log sheet. If anyone else decides to come out please bring a new log sheet and a very water proof container to keep it in. I will upload some pictures too. Thanks Butch for this amazing adventure and for all of the great caches. They have become legend among SLAGA territory.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
*gln	Write note	7/22/2005	Actually Butch, we weren't required to remove the caches in the State Parks, just get a permit. The MoDNR is very geocache friendly and actually want caches in the parks. I hope that someone decides to place another near here as this spot, like all your others, is a great spot. I hope that you are doing OK. Ever since I started you have been my Geocaching icon, the guy to try to beat to a cache and to be just like. I was hoping that you could show us a few more primo hiking spots before you quit caching altogether. Someone has place another cache at red bluff in your honor and a local cacher replaced your onondoga cache with the blessing of the parks service with the stipulation that they put it right where you had yours. If your other containers need to be picked up, I can probablly arrange that for ya. I wish there were more caches of "Butch Quality" around. Sadly tho, that is not the case. Cheers and thanks for your many contributions to Geocaching in the area and for being a role model for many of us.

Brother R and Nicole	Found it	4/10/2005	Reconciling my logged finds with my cache notebook. Missed this one and backlogging it now. Found on 10 April 05 with Stefanie of TeamMZFD and Coachman12 on an early MOGA morning. This was "the one not to miss" and we made it a point to not leave the area without doing it. Well worth it.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
Team MZFD	Found it	4/10/2005	Got up before the sun to find this cache. I had been watching and reading about this cache since I found out MOGA was going to be here. When I found out they gave us a map showing us the area, I was determined to find it. Coachman12, BrotherR and I headed out at 6am to find this one and try to be back in time for the 9am door prizes. We made it back by 9:30am and most of us still won a prize. This was by far the most expensive cache I have ever done. As Coachman12 stated I tripped on barbdwire and fell. Ended up in the hospital for xrays. The cache was well worth it and I would hike it again.! Thanks for taking me here! Stefanie Team MZFD Mt. Zion, IL	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
COACHMAN12	Found it	4/10/2005	Got up at 0530 to go out and get cache . LONG hike into cache with Brother R and Team MZFD. The hike was worth the effort. This cache is like it should be its about location. the view was beautiful. This was my 200th find. On our way out we Celabrated with a Wild Turkey. Stephanie of Team MZFD got caught on a Barb wire fence and took a fall. Pants ripped and shoulder Bruised but up and back on the trail in no time.

Sniper1	Found it	3/12/2005	I'm familiar with Green's Cave because that's where we always stop for lunch when we float that section of the river, so I've had this on my to do list for a long time. With MOGA coming up next month, I figured it was time to get familiar with the park. Very nice walk in, but the highlight of this cache has to be the views from the cache site itself. Won't do any good to try to describe it. You gotta see it for yourself. i wish I had remembered to bring my camera. TNLNSL. Thanks, Sniper1	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
teeks99	Found it	3/6/2005	We took the overland route from the parking lot near Hamilton Spring. It was a great day for a hike, and the view when we got there was spectacular. Beware, if you try to cut the corner from the stream up to the cache, and not follow the Meramec river past the cave and around, you're going to be running through some dense brush. Stay in the wooded area, not in the fields (there's lots of thorns). If you choose to follow the [horse] trail along the stream all the way to the river, it gets a little tricky near the end, but walking along the river is painless.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
thunder_monk	Found it	2/12/2005	One of the bad things about logging a cache last when you have found it with a group is that there is nothing left to say :P.....A very Longggggggg walk with some interesting scenery along the way but well worth the trip as you stand near the cache and take in the view. I will go back one day and visit the cave too but I am going to leave VERY early in the morning to give myself time to explore. Thanks Butch for a great cache and view...Left a couple of buttons and a couple of splash balls. TNSL Thunder from Rolla #454	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
MO Outdoorfamily	Found it	2/12/2005	After a morning of waypoint setting for M.O.G.A. several of us headed to Sullivan for lunch then back to the park to get in some caching. Since many of the others completed Meremac Cave Tour this morning and hadn't done this one they decided to go for it. Outdoorman63 and I decided to come back for Cave Tour later and joined the group on this perfect day for caching. I even hid one of my event caches for MOGA on the way from the Hamilton Iron Works to Greens Cave. I'm so glad I chose to make this trek, the long hike was very well worth it for the awesome views from the bluffs. As stated before the cache container has seen better days, thanks for volunteering to replace the container Drei. For anyone else checking out this cache page as a potential cache to find while in this park for MOGA, there are already at least 5 caches hidden on the way to this cache and I heard talk of at least 2 or 3 more being placed in this area before the MOGA event. I can't say enough good things about this cache, Thanks for placing this cache here.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
Dreicat	Found it	2/12/2005	Well what can I say about this that has not already been said. One thing that I would say is that I would give myself planty of time to do this one. The hike and the final cache locating was unbelievable. I was great hiking with a group to this one and made the hike a alot more enjoyable. Thanks for plaing this one butch. In the next week or so I am going to replace this cache with a new one so you don't have to worry about it any more. Drei and Sev East Carondelet, IL.

Strider	Found it	2/12/2005	I've had this on my list for a very long time, & today was the day. After working on the MOGA waypoints, we were beat, but ThunderMonk said "Let's do Green's Cave Overlook III", so off we went. There were 6 of us, and Sev the WonderDog. We had a great time, ThunderMonk and Sara both hid Event caches, and we all survived the hike. Even BlueBeadMan. The view from the top is one of the best in the state. We found the cache, then had a nice long sit, and enjoyed the sights. We took pictures, several with the cache camera, and a bunch more with our own. The cache container has a small hole on the top, courtesy of a gnawing animal, so we took all of the loose items that were moldy and ruined, and cleaned out the box. The baggie with the camera & logbook was ok though. Please replace the cache with the top down when you are done. I took a nice trip on a branch as I was leaving, but was away from the edge when it happened. We had a great hike down the hill, and made it back to the parking lot just after dark. Thank you very much Butch, this was the best I've done in a while.

2201	Found it	1/9/2005	Took late afternoon hike to this cache. It's ok just a little moisture inside but not bad considering all the rain lately. I took the straight line from the Hamilton Iron Works and this is a nice hike up and down some good size hills!! Good job and great placement who what a view.

Sullivan Bob	Write note	12/5/2004	My son and I decided to take a hike, so we decided to do the Green Cave Cache a second time. When we found it the first time in Jan. 03 it was my first cache and we came in from Hwy 185 and Hamilton Hollow road. This time we parked at the Hamilton Furnace/Cave parking lot and walked in from there. This may be a somewhat shorter route, but not as easy. We found the cache and it is in fairly good shape. We took a whooppee cushion for my grandkids and left a dollar. I've done 91 caches and this is still my favorite one. I like caches where you have to hike and work a little to get to them. Thanks Again.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
lunar_penumbra	Found it	5/31/2004	I hiked in from near 185 and wish I would have read through the previous logs so maybe I would have decided to wear long pants for the hike through the woods. As it was I found the cache without too much trouble but accumulated lots of scratches from weeds, brush, thorn bushes. Coming in from above, I found the cache easily, and took in the great view, then it took some time to find the path down to the cave. Unfortunately the camera I was using ran out of batteries and even though it might not have been the best idea when out in the middle of nowhere, I borrowed the batteries from my GPS to take a few more pictures before the camera died again. Luckily the batteries still had plenty of juice to get me back. Managed the return to my car more easily by following creek beds and small trails to avoid thorn bushes and brush. I also stumbled upon the old car in the middle of the woods.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
MASTER J	Found it	5/15/2004	Very first find (was with frogtoad)!!!! Was with 3 adults (one was mom, others men from scouting troop). Although one of the men had the GPS, the maps, and the compass, I was the one to actually uncover the cache. We hiked from Iron Works; cut-through was very idiotic and prickly. I took dork glasses (driving lenses), and one of the men left a dollar. 1st find. P. S. The old, dilapidated car was fun!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
frogtoad	Found it	5/15/2004	Wow! Led some first time geocachers on this. Had no idea it would be quite this tough. For anyone doing this by land, we recommend bringing a compass, especially because tree cover makes getting a signal problematic sometimes. We encountered fields of ticks, carpets of poison ivy, and lots of thorn bushes, but all in all decided it was a wonderful hike. With bugs, this would have been no fun, but there were no pests aside from the aforementioned ticks. We hiked in from Hamilton Iron Works, had to cross the stream 4 times taking off boots each time, but we imagine that the stream is usually a bit lower. We enjoyed finding depressions where deer had slept, the varied butterflies and birds and turtles. The view is gorgeous. Unfortunately the cache was quite soaked inside as were most of the treasures. However, on the plus side, the log book and camera were still bone dry due to the zip loc remaining intact. We tried to dry out the items for about 20 minutes, but most of them are still damp. We removed the two books as they were quite ruined. Not sure how it got so wet, as the rubber seal of the container still looks good. Took some broken sun glasses and left a wheresgeorge dollar. The hike back was equally adventurous as we tried to find a north easterly trail from looking at our quite inadequate map. Never found the trail, but did find an old car in the middle of the woods. Maybe there used to be a road there, but there are no traces of it anymore. The car is at N38 11.105 W91 05.245 should you care to venture that way on your return (no trail). Eventually found the road and walked back, total 5.3 mile hike. Thanks for a memorable cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
Know Future	Found it	11/3/2003	Another great river view by Butch! This was a perfect day and a nice hike from the Hamilton Iron Works. Took me about an hour and 15 minutes to reach the cache, and I did some poking around on the way. I took the magnetic key holders and left a BookCrossing book. Be sure to take a minute at Pratt Spring (see Topozone map). Beavers have built a dam to pond the water from the spring and their lodge is back inside the small cave where the spring outcrops. Those clever rascals! Here’s a couple of photos. My next message is not a clue to finding the cache. It’s an idea on how to reach it easier. I’ve encrypted it, in case you don’t want to see it.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii

Tim, Pam & Molly	Found it	10/26/2003	This one has been on the to do list for a long time. Finally got around to doing it today before packing up the trailer and heading home. Started out at the Hamilton Iron Works. Started out following the creek till it got pretty hard so we headed up into the field and found a trail that followed the creek. Molly had a really good time playing in the creek. We followed the trail till it started heading off in the wrong direction so we took off across the field that was the worst part of the hike. I would not do that during the summer. We did jump up a woodchuck in the field. Finally made it to the tree line. At the one valley Molly found some really deep mud and went in up to her stomach, I thought I was gone have to help her out but she made it out on her own. Started up the hill through the woods to find the cache. Ended up too high so we had to work our way down to the cache. Found it without any problems. The cache is in good shape and it’s dry. Loved the view of the river and seeing those old twisted cedar trees. I took a lot of pictures. Didn’t take time to go down to the cave, maybe next year we will float down to it. On the way out we stopped and checked out Plat Spring. This is one of the best caches we have done to this day. We highly recommend it to any body that can handle a four-mile hike. The elevation change wasn’t as much as I was expecting, we only climbed about 187 feet. It was really nice having the new GPS with the TOPO map loaded in it. It helped having the park map along also. TNLN Thanks for a fun cache with a spectacular view Tim, Pam & Molly [This entry was edited by Tim, Pam & Molly on Monday, October 27, 2003 at 6:42:45 AM.]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
dogda	Found it	10/14/2003	Started my way to this cache from 185, from near the suggested parking coordinates. After referring to the park map, I decided to go in a straight line to the cache site. I had to do some bushwacking and a little bit of up and down but overall the hike wasn't too bad. Both creeks I had to cross were basically dry, even after the previous days rain. I approached the cache from above, atop the bluff and found it with no trouble. The view from the cache area is great and the cache was in good shape. Now, where is the cave? I have floated the Meramec River, but not this section so I was not familiar with the cave location. Kind of hard to see the cave entrance from above. Worked my way down the bluff and finally found the entrance. Kind of hard to miss once you are there. This is a really neat cave. Fun to explore. After enjoying the cave I made my way back up the bluff side and back to the car the same way I got there. Total round trip about 4 miles. This is a great cache! Thanks for placing it! dogda	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
myotis	Write note	4/13/2003	Went back today but this time came in the other way (ironworks). This is definately the way to go. It is a much nicer hike. We waded down Hamilton Creek until we got to the river. Tevas or sandals is the way to go. The first time, I did not explore the cave. This time we did. It was one of the neatest caves I ever been in. Took lots of pictures: http://adobe.shutterfly.com/osi.jsp?i=67b0de21b33bfe3ac44d	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
talks funny	Found it	3/21/2003	What a day! We went in from 185. Took the ridge top until we hit private property. We followed the park boundry for a bit. Then we set a direct course to the cache. What can I say? I love long hikes in the woods,and there is something about bluffs that I am in awe of.Great spot, sat there for a while,then we headed in a north westerly direction to the old mining works in Miller Hollow. WE were going to follow the bottoms out, but some idiot left his walking stick buy a pond while he was doing a projection going in. So up we went to recover it. Success! We followed an old road back down that took us to the top of some bluffs overlooking a small lake that was probably created from mining operations.Nice view. After this we walked out through the bottoms to the car. Thank you for a great one! TNLN	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
myotis	Found it	3/8/2003	What I great way to spend my 44th birthday. This was a really nice one with great views. I took lots of pictures. I ended up hiking 6.11 miles to get this one. First I parked a bit down the road from 185. It looked like those gravel roads were the way to go. So I headed down them until I got to a private property sign. Then I had to turn around and back track. I took a short cut by those pits. There was about a 3 foot deep by 3 foot wide pit of water. But there was still shallow water around the deep water. I jumped and missed the deep water, but landed in the shallow water. I got pretty wet, but with it being 77, it felt good. I followed the trails (that had lots of ATV damage). I missed one turn, but figured it out and bushwacked until I found a trail. I then decided to take the fork that went to the river instead of the one that was more directly heading to the cache. I then had to bushwhack a half mile on cliffs above the river. I'm glad I went the long way as there was many nice views. But I would not want to do it in the summer. Lots of rose bushes. And there were lots of mosquitos! I got bit. The spring peepers were also going full steam. My camera records 30 sec sound clips, so I am uplading a sound clip. I was really impressed with the views from the cache. Once I got there, my GPS said I had gone 3.55 miles. It was worth it. I found a more direct route back. Thanks again for a really fun cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
Sullivan Bob	Found it	1/12/2003	January 12, 2003 by Sullivan Bob (first find) My son and I live in Sullivan, MO and we just found out about Geocaching. We have lived here for 35 years and have been hiking the surrounding area for a long time. Geocaching adds a new dimension to our hikes. We came in from Hwy 185 at Hamilton Hollow Road and walked past the blasting pits now a lake. This pit was make when they were thinking about constructing Meramec Lake in the 70's. We were able to walk on old roads (now ATV trails) to within 0.3 miles of the cache-then bushwacked the rest the way. Time for round trip was 2.5 hours. Took nothing. Great view.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
roelsch	Found it	11/17/2002	GeoCaching with Mean Gene. This was the cache-of-the-day (cache-du-jour?). Got a new pair of boots that I just had to try: mixed review -- waterproof, good traction, but not as comfortable as my New Balance shoes. We'd been here two weeks ago just at sunset, so we had to come back in the early afternoon -- and we're glad we did. This was the place to try the boots -- the hike back to the car seemed to be twice as long as the hike in to the cache, although it was actually somewhat shorter since we knew exactly where we were going. I didn't plot out a route from the Hamilton Iron Works to the cache before we left, so we did this one in the field as a test of our topo map reading and compass skills; I'd say we passed! That's quite a cache up there! That's quite a view up there! That's quite a step up there (not what I had imagined at all)! Didn't see any deer hunters, but did see a deer about 30 yards away. TNLN. Thanks, Butch! Maybe next time we'll try Red Bluff Cache? It's on our I-44 TODO list!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
Mean Gene	Found it	11/17/2002	Butch, the Green Cave caches have been on my list for a long time and I finally got to it. I was caching with Roelsch and we came in from the Iron Works. We pretty much followed in Konopapw’s tracks except for the fact that the vegetation was much less dense. The cache was easy to spot once we were standing in front of it. Took two pictures and left nothing. Total time for the 3.2 mile round trip was 2 hours and 20 minutes. Thanks, Butch, for placing this cache. – Mean Gene [last edit: 11/18/2002 5:50:41 AM PST]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii

konopapw	Found it	8/31/2002	6pm This was the last cache on my to-do list today and I wasn't going to be getting to the parking area as early as I had hoped. In fact, I had no idea where the parking area was, so with the help of the GPSR arrow and a few emergency u-turns, I found primitive parking at the 'Iron Works'. I parked at around 5pm. GPSR said cache was about 1.6 miles. I was relieved to see a trail to follow. Little did I know it ended about halfway to the cache! There was a point where I was blazing a path through shoulder-high weeds with sticker bushes nipping at my pants. (not to mention the escort of horseflies the entire way) Found cache after hunting about 10 minutes. Picture #27 is konopapw with bandana drenched with sweat. Took: calculator.

yakman	Didn't find it	6/22/2002	Hey Butch, I failed to find your cache today and I'm not dissapointed at all. Paddled the yak up from the ramp at Meramec SP and I only had to rope through the riffles twice. I tried this in May when the water was up and I didn't get 200 yards before the river sent me packing. Got to the cave and found a trail to the top. Found two standing slab rock/crevices surrounded by cedars within 10 ft of the cache according to my GPSR. No luck. Climbed back down to the cave to cool off and have a frosty beverage. Nature's AC. Reread the hints and tried it again. Still no luck. Who cares? Great view's and a relaxing float back to the park. Thanks for showing me another of Missouri's hidden gems. --Yakman	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii

Island-Dave	Found it	2/2/2002	Great cache location. I remember floating down, camping and exploring the cave here many years ago. Great view from the top of the bluff. Too much water in the cave to enter without boots. Today was my first group cache find. It was great to talk to fellow cachers and hear about their cache adventures. Thanks Earl for making the walk as short as possible. Thanks Bruce for giving us something to talk about. Took a small tape measure and left a surboard key chain. Cache in good shape with lots of treasures. Technically I was the first one here - but only by a few minutes. Thanks - Island-Dave	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
BruceS	Found it	2/2/2002	Walked in from the Hamilton trail head. This was a tough walkin because the creek and the river were up so we could not follow the trails much and had to bushwack the whole way. Timing was right and met up with the bunch that took the easy way in. Nice cache. Got out in front of the rest on way out and was walking with someone and he seemed to confidently turn left. I asked are you sure we should have turned left there and he said you mean you weren't leading. He said this looked like the right way so we continued on for another few hundred yards and things did not feel right. We stopped and I went scouting back to see if we were wrong. Got back to the trail intersection and all the foot prints were going the opposite way than we went. Went back and recovered the others. Moved right along and I think we got back not too long behind the others. - BruceS	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
JoA	Found it	2/2/2002	Greens Cave, This is such a good cache, I sure do hope more people are able to get up here. We found the cache to be chock full of great stuff typical of Butch. We sure are glad that butch has shared his spots with us. In the last 2 weeks we have gotten to cache with a few folks from around town. Going out with a group is really nice. Thanks to all that got together today. I am sure the posts will be interesting. BTW, which way did Bruce go again?

Barramus	Found it	2/2/2002	We all hitched a ride in the van with the under-worlders...thanks for the lift. After going through two security checkpoints, we were set. Had a nice walk in, saw some deer and a turkey. Watch your step near the edge. I.D. was the 1st to the cache, he hikes like Bruce ! Walked down into the cave, it was awesome. Thanks for bringing us here Butch. Bruce begged us for a ride back to his car so he wouldn't have to navigate the sticker bush field. Our party got split in 2 on the way out. But surely they just hiked fast and went to the car, right ? Nope, not there. Hmmm Nearly had to send out the search party but they all turned up pretty quick. They shall remain nameless to protect the innicent. Another great day with the gang ! Barramus & .007	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
*gln	Found it	2/2/2002	Greens Cave, Another fine hike walked all .75 mile each way, visited the cache, and the 1st Greens Cave cache site as well. We went in the cave and took a good look at the waterfall. Coming out of the woods on onto the top of the cave is one grand sight. Whilst we were in the area, we took a gander at the Hamilton cave too. One of these days were gonna put on our old muddy cloths and go into some of these caves. Has anybody seen BruceS? He was behind me then ahead of me but he wasn't back at the van. I think we misplaced him. For fun we went back over to onyx cave and found lots of trees and a big hole in the wall but no old caches.. just old cachers. <P><FONT face=Comic Sans MS color=#4040e0 size=2><STRONG><EM>**Glenn, St. Louis, Mo</EM></STRONG> </FONT>	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC79D_greens-cave-overlook-iii
RGS	Found it	2/2/2002	Went this AM with the Bell Mountain group, sans konopapw and BruceS, but added Island Dave. Took the short way in thanks to Earl and Lannis connections. And who do we meet? BruceS and son at the cache. Great views from the top and went down to the cave for a little exploring. Trip back to the car was 'interesting', but I'm sure someone else will report on that. Since konopapw wasn't there, no elaborate lunch like last week, so we made do with 36 cold White Castles, soda, cake, and cookies.

Daviskw	Write note	1/9/2002	This cache will not be easy to find. The first Greens Cave Overlook cache was stolen. I hope to avoid casual hikers finding this one.

It was great having him along to help with some of the more difficult D/T caches. As an older teenager it brought back fun memories of searching out caches, but at a level he now enjoys (rather than just simple Tupperware in the woods). This was a fun and exciting adventure. Water levels were only about 2" on average, and there was a "rope" to help us up the incline ... although we came prepared. My decent wasn't the most graceful, but I think my back was still recovering from the final 500' excursion in and back from the cache. As always, thanks for finding a unique place for a cache! Cool experience that certainly gets a favorite. #1,975	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
sgerbs	Found it	11/30/2018	Day 2 of our trip to St. Louis saw Dasher52 and I actually in St. Louis. After our morning event, we hit up a few select caches. I needed the D/T rating on this one and I enjoy a good Letterbox-Hybrid so into the abyss we went. This one took some work. I went what I thought was the required distance without finding anything. So I went a bit further and eventually made the find. This one is there and in good shape. Thanks for the adventure and the cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v

GeoWench78	Found it	8/30/2018	AF BEE and I found this one. More correctly, AF BEE donned his "stomp in the mud" boots and headed in...Forest-Ghost style (which is to say without deviating). Thanks for yet another adventure.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
AF BEE	Found it	8/30/2018	OCW GeoWench78 seeking 6 caches (including a birthday cache) to make this a 26 find calendar date...this was the last and the most physically challenging; wasn't sure if the rain yesterday would impact the flow, but no problem today, water flow was minimal...all went well and the inside of the container is dry...TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
Specter	Found it	4/11/2018	I notice this series about a month ago and it looked like it would be hard but fun. I have done Forest-Ghost caches before and have always had fun doing them I asked Tasmo if he was ready for a challenging adventure searching for the the Legend of the sword. Today we would start and attempt to complete this series. What can you say about Crystal Cave will it's dark and wet and did I mention it had water falls but no mud how about that for a cave. We had all the right equipment and training to complete this task without getting lost or getting really wet. Thanks for placing this cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
tasmo	Found it	4/11/2018	OCW Specter on a fantastic April caching day. This was either a very nostalgic cache for me, or maybe a PTSD cache, as I was having flashbacks to our search for the Architect while trying to recover this cache. Usually, I wish I were taller, but whenever I go to places like this, I wish I were about four feet tall, so that I could stand tall. We made our way, as it were, to the spot we needed to be to get a smiley on this cache, and I was extremely surprised to have kept receiving emails and notifications the whole time we were there. I don't know how that's possible, but it's true. Thank you for this cache, Forest-Ghost, and also for bringing back memories of another great cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v

TerriBikes+	Found it	2/27/2018	It seems when I cache with my young geobuddy, Phantom1692, it tends to be on Tuesdays and higher terrain rated caches- so here’s our “Terrain Tuesdays” adventure this week...... Even after last weeks heavy rains, we decided to go ahead and attempt Crystal Cave. Several inches of water flowed out of the tunnel, but that did not deter us from our planned journey, or shake our courage. While my waterproof overalls and hiking shoe/boots kept me dry, Matt’s attire didn’t fare so well. At times we walked through 3-4 inch deep flowing water...and referred to your ‘incline’ as “the waterfall.” The yellow twisted nylon ‘rope’ helped our ascent, but we both saw evidence of and fear it will be cut through sometime, as it continues to rub against the metal where it’s attached. After surmounting the concrete waterfall, the older stone passage was cool to see. But then, the tunnel got smaller and the long crouched trek to the cache was certainly noticed on our lower backs and knees. With the sound of flowing water continuous, other noises were muffled but caused us pause at times. We decided, fingers crossed, that we were just hearing land surface sounds. But once we spooked ourselves thinking we heard something coming at us in the water from far down the dark passage. To lighten the mood we joked about alligators in the sewer ;o...if that’s ‘lightening’ the mood. Matt had to rest on the way out a couple times as he’s 6’3” and his height was more of a disadvantage today than my 5’7.5”. At one point I bumped my head on the ceiling, knocking off my hat with headlamp. The light splashed and hit the floor and a battery rolled out. The sudden decrease in light was a bit eerie. Fortunately, I found the battery underwater and drying it was sufficient to get the wet lamp working again. Back at the waterfall, Matt ‘walked’ down backwards braced by his feet and taught rope. I wasn’t sure that was my best option (even though climbing up was fine) so I just had fun sliding down the water slide .... and still my overalls kept water away from my clothing beneath. Able to stand and not crouch again, we happily made our way back out graffiti entryway, congratulating each other as we did. This was another super adventure, made more challenging for us by the inches of flowing water. I'm sure this is easier in dryer conditions, and recommended....but I’m glad to have had this ‘extra’ fun added on. We took lots of photos and our smileys, and left you with our signatures and a favorite point. Thanks Ethan.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v

ThatGrif	Found it	1/28/2018	I started the Legend series last weekend, I had heard about this one and was eager to go find it. Toady we had the time and gear to go get this one. The start was weird but very easy, for a Ghost cache. We got in and made it to the incline. Really how is there graffiti in here who would see it, hope I don't find them! I went up the incline with the provided rope, I wouldn't really call it rope. They pulled unut up the incline and off we went. Read the hint and just keep going your back will ache but you don't want to do it over just keep going. We go there and it was unmistakable were you need to be. This was a fun hike and the decline was another challenge to get down but we made it and had a great time. Pictures added Thanks for a great cache	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
steve.n.erin	Found it	1/28/2018	The quest continues! Day 5 was an epic adventure that was crazy-fun. I wasn't sure what awaited me, so thank goodness I was prepared with water-resistant hiking shoes and a good waterproof, drop-resistant flashlight. As always, the route to the cache seemed a lot longer than the route back. Although I considered going further! I'm dying to know where I was and where I would have ended up. Thanks Ethan for another incredible adventure! Found with Geooh Live	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
beladi1	Found it	1/27/2018	We gathered our team of adventurers (Brantole, Mike Fitz, SWAseeker, Rempul and myself) after the Potluck to seek the Legend. Our last adventure for the day. We lite our torches and entered the Crystal Cave. The cavern floor and ceiling were wet. Continuing down the passageway we came to a terrain challenge. I had difficulty with this one but with perseverance and help from friend I was able to overcome it. Such a fun adventure.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
Repmul	Found it	1/27/2018	The other knights (SWAseeker & brantole, beladi1, Mike Fitz) & I, gathered at one of the round tables at the SLAGA Winter Picnic. As we feast, we formulated a plan of attack for the Legend Series of caches. Once we had a chance, we snuck out early to try and complete our quest to conquer as many of the Legend Series of caches we can in a day. This was the 4th of 5 caches, within the Legend Series cache that we found today. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
SWAseeker	Found it	1/27/2018	OCW Brantole, Beladi1, Mike Fitz and Repmul (that's lumper spelled backwards) this evening after slipping away from the potluck a bit early. What a great group to cache with and we made fast work with some nice long walks trying to knock out as much of this series as we could before it got too dark. Thanks for placing this cache. P.S. for you vertically challenged individuals out there this one is so much easier for you.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
Mike Fitz	Found it	1/27/2018	I teamed up with beladi1, Rempul, SWAseeker, and Brantole at the SLAGA Winter potluck event to continue our quest for the Legend cache series. We had done "Through the Forest Darkly" a couple of nights before and were eager to continue the series and get as many as we could today. We slipped out of the event and piled into Repmul's vehicle to begin the search on a beautiful January afternoon and as it turned out well into the evening. Had a ton of laughs along the way, great group of cachers and a great series. :) This was our fifth stop of the day, we parked as the sun was setting and suited up for our quest. Entering the cave we gathered the needed information and continued in the dark, dank depths. A little teamwork was required to gain some elevation at one point and Brantole led the way ever deeper until the prize was found. We made our way back out and down the slide to the exit where dark was upon us. On the next and final quest of the day. Thanks for the fun hide Forest-Ghost, gets a favorite from me.

brantole	Found it	1/27/2018	beladi1, rempul, SWAseeker, MikeFitz, & I found the Crystal Cave and thought we should explore to find the Crystals of Time. We thought they might reveal where Merlin hid the Sword to end our quest. We didn't find all the answers, but the cave did provide another clue to aid us in our journey. We have to warn other seekers of the Sword that there will be many challenges to test your worthiness along the way. The Crystal Cave is certainly a location which tested us. First, we were mentally challenged and had to overcome fear of darkness, small spaces, and venturing into the unknown. Second, we were physically challenged and had to overcome smells, rough terrain, and treacherous footing. Our small band of adventurers prevailed and left the cave a little wiser with a stronger bond between each member. Thanks, Forest-Ghost! I don't think I can express how much fun I am having with this series. SO COOL! And I also want to give a shout out of thanks to my fellow adventurers, beladi1, rempul, SWAseeker, MikeFitz, who helped make this possible and fun!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7B0GY_the-crystal-cave-legend-v
C3GPS	Found it	12/30/2017	Set out this morning in the COLD to get this one with Spiritwolf and PaulGracie. Didn't take long to do but if you have any height to you then you will be scrunched. Made our way up the incline with little issue but we were glad there was more than one of us there for that part. Teamwork prevailed and we made our way to the final and found it with no issues.

Iamgrateful	Found it	6/3/2018	OCW Mike Fitz on a spectacular 85F sunny Sunday. What a beautiful park, so much history here and so close to the Mississippi River....I love seeing the river eh. We were on the fence about whether to go for this or not cause of the rain yesterday but Michael said let's look at the trail. All seemed good so off we went. Easy enough hike but we over shot the deer trail by at least 10 metres...ugh. We then went back up to GZ and Michael quickly made the find. Nice. Great cache. A favourite point from me eh. Thanks for the fun. Every cache is exciting....a new location, a new experience and a new adventure. It's magic. I am grateful.

Mike Fitz	Found it	6/3/2018	Out with Iamgrateful on this beautiful early June day, the heat and humidity aren't as bad as the previous few days and a nice breeze helped to keep things pretty decent at least in the shade. We came out to Bee Tree Park where we only had the challenge cache so that gave us 10 caches neither of us had to look for. Saw lots of box turtles wandering the woods and had a great time with nice caches! As usual we made this one harder than it should have been, probably a T4 on the way in and a T2.5 on the way back out. We went down too far going in, hard to see the deer trail with All the foliage.

We followed the cache page instructions to get to the departure point from easy terrain, where PibAndPog waited with Beastly. I went ahead, a little lower on the hillside than needed to make it extra difficult for myself. I found it, though. Cool spot, although I was picturing something a bit more cavernous in my head. I re-hid better than I found it, then discovered the more flat route back to the Rocky staircase. We took the trail farther back to the north and came out surrounded by screaming children.

Made the find quickly, added a little swag, and replaced as found. Thanks for placing, giving you a favorite. On to the next...........	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7HQ80_nims-cave

Had to do some backtracking and we finished after dark and we made about 4 or 5 finds with a cellphone flashlight. We did have people stop to check on us at a couple of spots along our route. We also spotted 2 eagles in a large tree near a cache stop and that was cool. We had a great time out here and glad we got to do this series before the weather gets rougher.

flowten	Found it	11/23/2018	I took four days off for Thanksgiving and told the wife I needed to cache at least one of those days. I wanted to pick some type of high value target and knew this star was in place since the beginning of the month. My son is an OTR driver and is home for the holidays so I asked him if he was up for a trip. He always says yes so off we went. We made a day trip of it and spent more time driving than we did caching. We finished up the series just before the heavy rains came in so things worked out perfect. I know it takes a lot of effort to create a geoart so your efforts are very much appreciated.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7T6F0_-mammoth-cave

Since we had to get back home at a decent hour... we weren't sure if we could get more than the dozen or so caches we needed to get this month's souvenir. But before we knew it... we were two thirds of the way there and just couldn't stop. This made for an incredibly fun afternoon!

I can never remember	Found it	11/10/2018	My caching partner and most excellent friend mjholley and I had to make an emergency trip to southern Illinois this weekend to correct our biggest blunder to date so we had to figure out a way to sweeten the deal for ourselves. Turns out a brand new 71 cache geo-art and a GIFF event was what it took to hook us. We came up with a system for getting these all solved and got through them quickly. We got bogged down by the recaptchas a few times and really, that was the most challenging part of the whole thing so overall I think we did all right. We budgeted our day rather well and we managed to finish this geo-art in 3 hours, right on the button for what we estimated, even with some backtracking and missed turns. We had a great time zipping around the backroads and running into various carloads of cachers along the way. It makes everything doubly cool that this series was hidden on my birthday! All in all a great day with MJH, my favorite road trip partner! Many thanks for the great series! TFT?C!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7T6F0_-mammoth-cave

We took the first letters from each of our geocaching names and signed each log 'C3PN' for CapnSeaBert, CycleKen, Crazy4Moose, Phil 4:13, and Nickel01. We had a great time zigzagging all over the area grabbing caches and even recognized a few spots that had been in the dove series a few years ago. Thanks for hiding these caches and getting us outside on this beautiful clear cold winter like day. We had a fun adventure!

We had our sights set on a few caches along the route but the main focus was getting the new state star geoart. We started the art at 2:15pm and finished at 5:15pm right at dusk.

Flamingo4ever	Found it	11/8/2018	Oh my gosh, I was so excited for the new Geoart. In less than 24 hours I had solved and mapped all of the coordinates for when my sister Breezy406 came up North for the GI FF. I mapped all of the caches so we could rock them out as fast as we could. We had a 9:30 nail appointment so we could get a bright and early start. We had already completed the Dove and when it was archived, I was happy a new art piece placed. These are the types of caches I love to do during the summer... No ticks, bushwacking and poison ivy. I want to thank you for bringing this cache to our geocaching community and maintaining it. Cache on my friends and back to the cache mobile!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7T6F0_-mammoth-cave

ArtieD	Found it	11/4/2018	FTF! So I heard that a new geo-art was published in the St. Louis area, right where the Dove geo-art was. It sounded really neat! So, when they published, I began my work on them. Solving them was no problem, and I got all but the bonus cache solved. Well, it turns out that I began a new gig on night shift due to a promotion at work. Since it is overnight, one of the key ways to maintain on the job is to treat every day like it's a work day, so staying up all night even on a day off is required. Last night I sat there looking at all the caches, seemingly unfound. Hmmm...could I go there and beat my record of 17 FTF's in day? It sure seemed so! What the heck, I thought...let's go for them. I set out at about 12:30 a.m. toward the St. Louis area. Night caching does not bother me, so why not stay up all night going on a grand FTF run? It also happens that early this morning, the time changed, falling back an hour. Good for me! Once in the area, I began to work. The caches were found easily, and I was happy to mark this cache as one of my many FTF's! At some point in the night, I even passed my 700 FTF milestone! Thanks for the excellent series, Strider!

jimd	Found it	8/29/2003	I was about to dive into the underbrush when GuitarNutz walked up. He had us confused briefly with a printout from another cache. That settled we found the cache together. I took the OldNavy tree and left a Bee pez dispenser. He had coords for the State Quarter cache so off we went across the creek. I can't log that as a find since I'm not a paying customer. thanks for the hunt and a very nice park. [last edit: 8/29/2003 8:06:48 PM PST]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D98_smiths-cave

BAMBOOZLE	Found it	7/24/2003	We are in the KC area for a geocaching vacation and to visit family. My father-in-law lives in Gladstone so we took him along to introduce him to the world of geocaching. This was his first cache. He visited several parks in the area today that he had not known about before. This one is very close to his home. There was a lady running her dog in the park when we arrived. She recognized us as Geocahers and said although she is not a cacher herself she knew about it and had found the cache in this park or actually her dog had found it. She wished us luck and went on her way. Nice hide. TNLN Thanks Bamboozle	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D98_smiths-cave
qman2	Didn't find it	7/18/2003	We were within 20 feet of it and gave up. It was 9:00pm by the time we got there. Still enough light until you walked back into the timber. We'll give it another shot in the daylight hours soon!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D98_smiths-cave
KaiserKlan	Found it	7/6/2003	[My first find. My husband has always found them before. Cool. It was more difficult than antipicated due to the overgrowth of brush and brambles.

We walked down the trail and spotted a faint path that led to the old cache. I started manually decrypting the clue and figured it out. Watch out for poison ivy!

cortneyofeden	Write note	6/6/2003	Came to get Key #3 for KC, Where's The Key?, but didn't bother bringing the GPS since we've found the cache before and were pretty confident that we could find it without any help. Apparently I should have read the cache logs. Eventually we found it after a little bit of confusion and widening the search area. Helped to follow Harp's nose, since it's when Ethan followed her that I heard, I found it!

kcdreamer	Write note	5/27/2003	I verified my cache was stolen. I hope by an inadvertant non-geocaching finder. I hid another one today, but off the path further this time.

Freight Pilot	Found it	4/7/2003	Found this cache today. I enjoed the hike, nice place. The cache was easy to find.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D98_smiths-cave
Squeamish	Found it	3/23/2003	Found the cache fairly quickly...then went over and found the cave. The entrance I found wasn't blasted shut at all, and the ceiling went down to about 1 foot high (a very low squeezeway) a short distance from the entrance, so I didn't follow it any farther. This may be just the back (upstream) entrance to a larger cavern, there is no way this was ever large enough to have been a dance club. There wasn't even enough room to stand up. Looking at the topo maps, it would make sense for this sinking stream to come out along the creek slightly to the north, which is probably where the larger entrance that was blasted shut is (was) located.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D98_smiths-cave

Puzzzler	Found it	1/16/2003	Being from out of town, I didn't find the right parking location, so I ended parking on the south side of the park and buskwacking through the woods. Normally this wouldn't be too bad, but today there were 3 inches of snow on the ground. Finally, after crossing the creek, I came upon the regular trail and followed it towards the cache. After reading the hint, and brushing off snow, I discovered the hiding place. Thanks for the fun. Dave	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D98_smiths-cave

cortneyofeden	Found it	12/31/2002	Nice and easy find in a lovely little park. As a caver, it's too bad that they blasted the place closed - there aren't many caves in this part of Missouri. Packed out a bag of trash. Looks like some teenagers had a little party in the park not too long ago. Didn't get all of it, but got a decent number of bottles and cans out of the fire ashes. Took a book (Devil's Advocate) which I'll read and place in another cache, as well as a little green plastic frog. He just begged me to come along so he can sit on my dashboard for a while. Left several stamps and an ink pad, as well as a world marble from the DeLorme's store in Maine.

I wondered how I could sneak in there and get it before them, if I was in Columbia. The answer was obvious - I'd have to go before I went East (in the dark). This is the first cache I have attempted in the dark and there were some unforseen challenges. Not only can you not see the cobwebs, stickers, trails etc., it was foggy to boot. After I found the cache (no-one else was crazy enough to go after it last night), a piece of almost invisible barb-wire reached out and skewered my shoelace right at the base of the tongue. As I did my twirling gymnastic impression, I was wondering what I would fall on, and how long a tetanus shot was good for. This time, though, I didn't fall down or get poked - just twisted up my shoe in the barbwire. I was prepared for once, and used my multitool's wire cutter so I could make my getaway. The good news is that there aren't any boogeymen out here, and the coordinates are right-on Took/Left nothing	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D98_smiths-cave

Soldiers of Fortune	Found it	2/21/2004	As Barry already described this area is a beautiful example of what makes our Ozark Mountains special. This was our second backpacking trip and we are now spoiled due to finding a perfect camp site. It was disappointing finding the chewed-up cache lid because it means that the rest of the cache is now trash somewhere in this pristine area. It would be great to see a cache placed here in a container that can't be destroyed. Thanks Myotis for giving us incentive to visit Rock Pile Wilderness. Dana, Barramus, Zoe and Beauty	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCBFE5_cave-branch-cache
Barramus	Found it	2/21/2004	We've had our sites' set on this cache for a while now. This weekend we set out to do it finally. We parked on top of Little Grass Mountain, the entrance to Rockpile Mountain Wilderness. I remember this trail from doing the Rock Pile Cache 2 years ago. The hike to this cache is about 2 miles farther but not as difficult as Rock Pile cache. We setup camp at Myotis's recommended spot and it was beautiful. There was plenty of water in the creek and a nice flat spot for the tent. Also there was an existing fire ring so having a fire wasn't a problem. After settng up camp we proceeded downstream to get the cache but was sidetracked by the beauty of the area. This is a most awesome area and highly recommended to anyone able to make it here. I've uploaded a few pictures of the canyon area. The sun was setting soon so we decided to hit the cache. About 100' from the cache coordinates we saw something blue in the leaves. Dana reached down and picked up a chewed-up lid from the cache. We searched for the container and logbook but couldn't find anything else. Found the item listed in the clue but nothing there either. We tracked about 5 miles in and about the same going out even though we bushwacked to Rock Pile cache. Hopefully this cache will be replaced. It would make a great group hunt. Barry, Dana, Zoe and Beauty.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCBFE5_cave-branch-cache

Phantom 491	Found it	11/27/2005	While in the area visiting my children I decided to go after this cache. Unfortunately I had entered the wrong coordinates into my GPS. I finally realized my 300 Foot mistake, fixed the coordinates, and headed right to the cache. Great hide, & location.

Jhwk	Found it	8/8/2005	Actually I replaced the cache that had gone missing for some months. The new container is a traditional ammo can filled with goodies, especially a new first to find prize for the next cacher to come this way. Once control of this cache gets passed to me, I will update the coords. for the cache from what is listed above. Based on my multiple readings, you should probably shoot for N 37* 38.868 W 092 01.210. From previous logs, folks seemed to have been confused by the coords. I took the cache out a few weeks ago and placed it in the tiney (tiny) cave, with a new log book and a disp. camera. The old cache container was still there so I packed that out. I think the culprit on this cache may have been some form of animal. Seems to have been "lost" a few times in the past. Hopefully a good ammo can will keep the critters out. I also added Sean's Kayak TB to sweeten the deal.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache

Since there still might be a box at the location, I can not archive it. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. Hope things get fixed up soon. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. [b]If I do not hear from you about fixing up this cache, I will assume that it is abandoned (since you haven't logged into geocaching.com since Tuesday, January 25, 2005 ), and archive the cache. We need to work to maintain the good relationships we have with the forest service in the area. We cannot afford to let our caches turn into litter. ** There is an cacher interested in fixing the cache up.

Jhwk	Didn't find it	6/18/2005	I'm afraid this cache is gone. As the last two visitors noted the container was not there, but I did find one just down the hill, and a small plastic motorcycle that may have been in the cache. Great site - I hope we get it back up and running again. Photos show the "leavings"	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache
rynnlsn	Found it	12/27/2004	I found it with the help of my brother, sister and daughter. I love the area as I am from Kansas this is considerably different. We had the same trouble as the last log, there was no cache that we could find, we took nothing and left nothing, but loved the search any way. Thank you	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache
Three Day Weekend	Found it	9/18/2004	I know I found the correct spot, but apparently, the cache has been muggled. I found a container, clear plastic jug, but there was no lid or contents. Took a while to find this, but that was stupidity on my part. I knew "what" I was looking for, but for some reason I kept looking on top of the likely area. I should have been looking in the "cavey" area. Obviously, I did not sign the log.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache
BWAT	Found it	5/22/2004	What a hike up the hill!!! That cache could be anywhere! Finally....and I mean finally....we found it. Thanks for bringing us to his remote little place. Nice little spring. Thanks Bridge w/a t	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache
Tim, Pam & Molly	Found it	5/22/2004	Found this one with The Brawny Bear and Bridge w/T. This one took some time to find. We looked high and low. Bridge w/T decided to head back to the truck to get the hint and a flashlight. Really liked the area the cache was hidden in. The Bear and Tim enjoyed rinsing off in the spring water after spending almost one hour finding this cache. The log book was a little damp. TNLNSL Thanks Tim, Pam & Molly Washington, Mo.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache
Brawny Bear	Found it	5/22/2004	Nice cache!!! We looked for a long time all around the coords and finally Tim found the opening. Lots of critters hanging around the cache. I liked the spring that was close by. I had a slip on some rocks and fell. I was on flat ground though but nevertheless, it hurt! The cache was in OK shape. We didn't notice any more chewing on the lid. Just a small amount. Lots of Tics in the area... TN - Left Alien Paratroopers The Brawny Bear	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache

Geo Jim	Found it	12/8/2003	11 am.. doing some caches in/near Rolla. Very interesting site - I like it! I decided Geo Jim Jr. was prolly pretty bored though, so I moved him over to the Interstate. Left Squished penny. By the way, the new container has already had about a third of the circumference of the lid chewed away (photo avalible upon request). Not sure how much longer the cache will be secure. I tried to position it to make it more difficult for critters to get at the lid. Geo Jim	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache
jeepers2	Found it	11/15/2003	Cache Rescue: Shaky climb up to the cache location. Found the remains of the treasure and put them in a new container; clear squarish, Mr Peanut plastic jar with blue lid. Complete with a new log book. Dropped off Geo Jim TB. Great hidey hole. Jeepers2 & Memphis	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache
Team Kuebbing	Found it	10/2/2003	Found what was left of the cache, it's in serious need of help. The contents are all that remain of the cache and they were found in several locations of the cave. It may have been a critter that caused the damage but it would have to be a smart one to have gotten all the items as widely dispersed as they were. We gathered all the contents and put them in one location where we suspect the original container was kept. Items include necklaces, toy plane, fish, and other nick nacks. As I said there is no container but there is also no logbook. Hope to see this cache brought back to life after having spent over 2 hours and a quarter tank of gas looking for it thanks to bad directions and a new navigator. It's not your fault Day, could of happened to anyone. The new addition to the search party this outing was SSG Martinez from Ft. Hood Texas in the 1st Cav. He said he won't be joining us again he had a rough go at it. Day and Parrafiallo are now permanent fixtures until Chem BNCOC class 07-03 graduates. Thanks for the hunt.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCB7D_tiney-cave-cache

Garnath	Found it	2/2/2003	WOO HOO first at the cache was there at 1:08 on Groundhog day (think he may have been hiding in the cave) it was a wonderful day had to get out before it snowed again. Fantastic drive and area for a cashe will have to come back when I can drive and walk some more. You had better believe the terrain difficulty it may even be a little low if its wet, took the glass fish left a small lock.

Tollybrew	Found it	7/1/2004	Looking for another one after work before it is gone. Once again another TB for my trip north. This took a little bit more looking. Involved a bit a bushwacking but once near ground zero the cache was fairly easy to find. Grabbed it just as it started to rain. Left compass and took ET TB. Thanks!

Phatty	Didn't find it	6/4/2004	Sad to say I did not find this cache. Looked for at least 15 minutes. Was wearing shorts and flip-flops (poison-ivy???) and was rushed to get back to the Hotel to change for a rehearsal dinner. Was also a little leary at first because the cave was surrounded by POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS tape. All in all it was still nice to find this area tucked away in the middle of town. Thanks. May try again before we leave, but if not will try when in St. Louis again.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
LobsterVac	Found it	6/3/2004	Cool Cave. My son found it with a little help from the younger member of the Wyldeberries while I chatted with the Senior Wyldeberry. Dropped off RoboDog TB	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

Ronimous3	Found it	4/20/2004	This would be a nice park if the city spent more money building it up and cleaning out the cave. A woman was yelling at her kid nearby and I kept thinking she was yelling at me. Needed the hint since there were alot of obvious hiding places nearby. Took the mini deck of cards and the Dave & Busters frisbee, left ninja guy and the volkswagon bug (not TB) BTW, the log is full and needs another. MyhtyMyke	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

FACT Finding Family Four	Found it	4/17/2004	Found it at 9:30 a.m. I wonder if the path through the woods, which starts just past the cave, gets really overgrown in the summer. Took "Chosen Frozen" (snowboarder) TB and Mardi Gras beads for geocaching daughters. Left Korean drum key-chain (from Korea, for real). TFTC!

Motorgirl	Found it	3/7/2004	Third cache on a nice but windy day. Nice park- and the cave area is really cool! Took the Lord of the Rings pin and the lobster- left mini playing cards and a reflector. Motorgirl & Juancho	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
frogtoad	Found it	3/7/2004	Interesting little park to be tucked away like that below a cemetery. There is presently a huge pile of mulch at the entrance to the park, apparently free for the taking, as many nearby residents were pulling up to load up their pickup trucks and vans. Our dog certainly enjoyed nosing around in it. We eventually found the cache after adjusting our initial assumptions about where it would be. The cave was quite muddy. We noticed a manhole cover that drains into it. Thanks for the cache! Took beach ball and small elephant, left cemetery-appropriate wind-up walking skull and ambulance.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
deltawinner	Found it	2/28/2004	Found with GeoPioneer. Last for the day. Had to wait for 4 adventuresome females to hike through the area before we continue looking throught the cache.

A & W	Found it	2/14/2004	There was still a lot of ice in the area, so the going was slow. Interesting cave. Ice was 'growing' like a stalagmite inside the cave due to the water dripping from above. Found the cache without a problem. TNLN. Thanks.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

This was our second time to Sibert's Cave as we came at high misquito time in the summer and did not want to bushwack through the dense curtain of humming wings and sharp proboscis....Took flashlight and key chain wallet, left Lord of the Rings collectors pin and new small matchbox race car in original plastic.

lexxor	Found it	12/22/2003	The weather was nice today. We are visiting St. Louis from Shreveport, LA. We went caching with parents. Found the cave to be larger than we thought.

breilly	Found it	8/16/2003	Nice little park. Wonder if the cave is natural or man-made. My guess is was built to store food for a house that was probably up on the hill long, long ago.

JanS03	Found it	8/3/2003	GPS ran us all over the place, but we finally found it! Who would ever have thought there was a cave here! Thanks. JanS03, LeeS, Pamski, and Italy Woman	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
King Boreas	Found it	7/15/2003	I must be lucky. I went to two Manchester caches and one Chesterfield cache today: [b] ... not a single mosquito ... [/b] Took the Gekko TB, and left a Golden Ameristar Dollar. Thanks for the cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
the Woodman	Found it	7/13/2003	Our first Cache. We live within 2 miles of this, I drive past it every day and never really gave it a look. I like the cave. Had my GPS only a few days, so not very capable yet - found cache by guesswork. Fun stuff! Woodman and wife, Little Buddy	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
Tim, Pam & Molly	Found it	7/13/2003	Nice Park. The mosquitoes were really bad. The GPS didn’t work very good when we got close so we had to look for the signs of a cache. Never knew there that cave was back there. Been by the park a lot of times but never stopped in. Thanks for giving us a reason to stop. TNLN Thanks Tim, Pam & Molly	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

Soldiers of Fortune	Found it	6/7/2003	1/2 Took awhile to find this cache because of the tree cover, but diligence (or hard-headedness) paid off. Took Baby Bear TB and left a TB I picked up in Cincinnati. Thnaks for the cache. Dana w/ Barramus and the pups	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

QRPTim	Found it	6/1/2003	Neat little park. I had no idea there was a cave back there. Brought another family caching with us and I think they are now hooked. Left a car, took a puzzle.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
talks funny	Found it	6/1/2003	I'll be darned if I didn't leave my flashlight in the car! What an idiot! That little cave looked pretty neat! But I was to tired to go back to the car to get a light. The cache was easy to find. Thanks! TNLN	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

Earthworm Jim	Found it	5/4/2003	All the way from Michigan, to visit family, and I can't resist caching for a couple of hours. Rainy day though. I seem to have gotten my Uncle (RecOfficer) addicted to Caching now. Nice little shelter cave, I never get to see caves at any of the Michigan Caches.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
MrB	Found it	5/3/2003	Another neat little park to which I've never been. Cave was cool also. GPS has really been giving me problems today. Was off by 30 feet but I was able to spot the cache anyway. TNLN.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

robertlipe	Found it	3/23/2003	For some reason, I overshot this one substantially. Usually the Magellan averaging doesn't shoot me 250 feet past them, but this time it did, and I can't blame tree coverage, the coords, or cosmic rays. It was a fun hunt even with that and I enjoyed the cave. Thanx.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

Princess & Frog	Found it	3/16/2003	Nice obscure park in a very busy area. Great little walk on a beautiful day & our second find of the day. All the church bells ringing made it an even better find. TNLFrog & doubloon. Wish we had that cave on our property so I could banish Frog to it when he aggravates the Princess! Thanks, Princess & Frog	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
bignose	Found it	3/15/2003	My wife looked in the cave and a flock of bats flew out at her (Red Bats that sing!!!!) Cardinals Good hide, like the location Our 1st find, we were really excited	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
T.Hedwig	Found it	3/15/2003	The new Adopt A Stray store is just a couple hundred feet from the cache. We recommend including a visit there as part of your outing! We never knew the cave existed--always thought the bridge was the entrance to the cemetery. Took nothing but left a foam puzzle. Thanks. T.Hedwig and John [last edit: 3/16/2003 10:36:45 AM PST]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
J Cash	Found it	3/14/2003	You were right - we had no idea there was actually a park (and cave) back there! A nice, easy and enjoyable find. Thanks for putting it there. Left a hot wheel car, took nothing. J Cash, wife and terrier	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
Gusterroids	Found it	3/12/2003	Walked from Play This, Schroeder although cutting across the cemetary was not a good idea after we discovered on the other end that the gate wasn't open on that end. Climbed the short part of the fence to get over. Guess I've kind of noticed the little white bridge in driving by on Manchester Road but never took the time to see what was back there. Cool little cave. Nice little walk in a very urban area.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
Doug-T	Found it	3/6/2003	Visited site about a week ago, but snow cover made search difficult that day. Better luck today. Found almost immediately. Signed log. TNLN Thanks; Shamrock40 [last edit: 3/7/2003 9:25:00 AM PST]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

hikerbob	Found it	2/23/2003	Paked by the bridge and found the path after looking around by the deck for a while. Nice easy walk to the cache and we spotted it quickly. Nice cave for being in the middle of town. Thanks, HikerBob & Michelle	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
Nodrog2	Found it	2/23/2003	A damp gloomy day but wanted to see if the South African coin was still in the cache. Although I live within 3 miles of this park I didn't know it existed. Scouted out the cave and then found the cache easily. Took the coin and left a super ball. A cop was coming in the park just as I left. Probably saw my car and wanted to check on what I was doing on such a lousy day. Gave him Geocaching 101 and he seemed fascinated. Nice spot, Tribble! Thanks!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
GB-Cacher	Found it	2/16/2003	Found this one while it was snowing out. Fresh snow left little tracks from day before. GPS pointing in the woody area, but hint helped to find the cache. Will have to come back to the cave when its warmer. Eery! Left 5 Rand South African coin, took Beany Platypus. Recognised the bridge, but never knew part was back here. GB-Cacher	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
roelsch	Found it	2/15/2003	GeoCaching with Mean Gene. It was umbrella weather for this part of the trip, and boots were helpful for the mushy ground. Nice little park; found the cache easily (thank goodness). Stopped by the cave on the way back to check out the eerie glow on the back wall; just light coming in from a grate-covered vertical shaft. TNLN. Thanks, Tribble157!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
Mean Gene	Found it	2/15/2003	Caching with roelsch. The description was correct – I knew the bridge was there but did not know about the park. It was perfect geocaching weather – cold and rainy. We found the cache quickly then explored the cave. Took nothing and left nothing. Good job. Thanks, Tribble157, for placing this cache. – Mean Gene	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
RMDSAN	Found it	2/11/2003	This was my fourth find. I don't get much chance to get out to geocache much having 2 year old twins. Weather makes it difficult sometimes. But what a great way to get the young'uns aquainted with the great out doors. I did this one in the dark. Made it interesting! lol Actually I found it fairly fast. tnln RMDSAN	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

Rick1812	Found it	2/8/2003	Trip down memory lane for me. This one is about 0.25 miles from my parents’ house. As kids we used to “explore” the Grand Glaze Creek all the time. Wondered when someone would place a cache here. Met Pa and Ma on the way out. (I rarely write a log in, or even open urban caches) Rick	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
pa	Found it	2/8/2003	We met another cacher while we were on our way to the cache but he didn't log here or in the log book. Nice park, neat cave and good cache. Thanks. PA and MA	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave

konopapw	Found it	2/4/2003	It certainly isn't obvious that there's a park at that busy corner. RGS and I saw a vehicle in the parking area. Figured it had to be another geocacher. It was Goshhawk, whom I had not met before. Turns out he has a few things in common with V.P. Dick Chaney. Toured the cave for a second, then moved onto the cache. TNLN (konopapw)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
goshhawk	Found it	2/4/2003	It was a chilly, but beautiful blue sky morning of only 25 degrees when I located this park and headed out for the cache. Enjoyed seeing the cave and the covered bridge. Walked down the trail and found the cache without too much difficulty. TNLN. As I was sitting in the parking area trying to orient my maps to find Scroeder, RGS and Konopapw drove up. It was a pleasure to see Rich again and to meet Paul. Since I still wasn't sure where the next park was, I waited until they finished this cache and then teamed with them on the next one. Thanks for placing this cache.JL Goshhawk	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
RGS	Found it	2/4/2003	11:30 - Still with Konopapw, we stopped here and saw a familiar face. It was Goshhawk, trying to find out how to get to Schroeder's piano. Went to the cache and toured the cave. I remember when the road went through this area before they rerouted it, but never had seen the cave. Then the 3 of us went to look for Charlie and friends. Thanks Tribble, nice area. TNLN Rich	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCCED5_seibert-cave
Island-Dave	Found it	2/4/2003	7:42 AM Cold this morning. I have driven by this park many times but never stopped. This is a nice little park. Neat cave. I guess it was man made. Quick find. LN=TN.

Mesozoic	Found it	3/2/2014	Cool little cave someone should make an earthcache out of this one..... :-) My brother came down yesterday and we headed to Roaring River Trout Park. We then hit the road after caching some nice size trout and went after some geocaches in the area. We targeted a lot of the late GEO*Trailblazer 1’s geocaches.

crystalcachers	Owner Maintenance	12/31/2011	A huge thank you to all the cachers who have looked for this one. The area looks exactly the same as the day this one was hidden - a huge relief as I was concerned about increased impact in this area. The cache was a bit off from its hiding spot but has now returned to its original spot, with a new notebook and some goodies that should make the search worthwhile!

NicknPapa	Didn't find it	12/18/2011	This was our second DNF today. Loved the hike down but when we got to the bottom the GPS went crazy again. It refused to settle on even a vague area, it would point 70 feet one direction and we would take a couple of steps that way and it would change it's mind an point 70 feet in the opposite direction. We tried a brute force approach for a while but gave up on that pretty quick and headed back for the car. I wasn't quite as fond of the hike back up, it was quite a bit easier to keep my footing but it also gave me a pointed reminder that I'm not a teenager any more. Didn't help my pride at all to have Nick standing there looking at like "what a wimp" while I was busy panting like a dog that had just ran a marathon...... We'll try this one again too.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCD209_onyx-cave-cache

the3suttons	Didn't find it	2/7/2009	GPS took us for a ride on this one. We followed a dirt road that from Hwy 62 to Hwy 37... 10 miles long. Needless to say... not the right road. Nice country side. Then we visited another area that we thought the it may or may not be the right area. This was a start to a caching trip to Eureka. Spent alot of time driving around to the bogus GPS direction we decided to move on. Going to come back to this one on a later date.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCD209_onyx-cave-cache

ARCHIVING CACHE As there's been no cache to find for a while, I'm archiving your cache to keep it from continually showing up in search lists and to prevent it from blocking other cache placements. If you wish to repair/replace the cache sometime in the very near future, just contact us (by email), and assuming it meets the guidelines, we'll be happy to unarchive it. Thanks a MILLION, Glenn "Seek quality, not quantity" --Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is:*gln, Mongo and Banjo-Boy	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox
*gln	Post Reviewer Note	2/2/2016	To BE ARCHIVED VERY SOON Greetings, We noticed that your cache has been temporarily disabled for a period of time well in excess of the period of "a few weeks" as contemplated by the cache guidelines published on the Geocaching website. While I feel that Geocaching HQ should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around your cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please, either repair/replace this cache or archive it (using the archive listing link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location. If you plan on repairing this cache, please log a note to the cache (not email) within the next couple weeks so we don't archive your listing for non-communication. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. Many Thanks, Glenn (*gln) Missouri Cache Review Team, *gln, Mongo & Banjo Boy	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox

*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	11/24/2015	STATUS UPDATE NEEDED Greetings, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last note or two I see this cache could use a little attention. It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, its being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page. If it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable it, to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache. If you decide that this project has reached it's end you can archive it to remove it from the active cache database. When everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log removes the "needs maintenance" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute! I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future. HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS Respond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select "Post Note" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process. If you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above. Glenn "Seek quality, not quantity".

den2den2	Found it	3/22/2015	I should have read the cache page before attempting this one. I found it easy enough and discovered the post cards, but didn't understand why there was a blank one and a completed one with a stamp. I felt an obligation to get the card mailed, so I took the completed one, but left the blank one. Now that I have a chance to take a look at the cache write-up, I feel like I messed things up.

It was beautiful, a great day to walk the paths in this park. My caching companion Tony Banks set up a bit of complaining about thorns and plants, but I tried to explain that's how you keep an ammo can or other larger cache going without Muggling. No postcards, I'm sorry to say. You'd have thought I'd be prepared! Maybe I'll stop by again, because this place is worth it.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox

eravau	Found it	8/31/2013	(#1,890) Out caching on this fiery-hot last day of August with Pastor G. It may have still been before 9:00 in the morning... but the heat and humidity had the gnats and the horseflies buzzing around all over the park. There was seemingly no way to escape their annoying presence around your face and ears... but we kept swatting anyway. We had come to the area specifically to seek the earthcache... but with this cache so close to the parking lot... we couldn't pass it up. The most direct route to the cache from the trail seemed a bit overgrown... but a few feet further down the trail opened the brush enough to be passable. We made our way up the hill... and the cache was quickly found in an expected place. I took nothing... but left my signature and one of my signature item. Thanks for the hide, Klammeraffe!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox

I stopped to get this and the Earthcache in this park on my way home. I needed them for Hockabee's Shady Challenge. The gate was closed at the top so I hiked through the slush to the Eartcache then to this one. This is a great park. Love the cave. Thanks for bringing me here.

TImHowardsPlaneteers	Found it	10/20/2012	Found this with shilorax, this was a very interesting state park. Thanks for the cache. We picked up a trackable here as well, which we will be moving along soon. We had never seen one of these postcard caches before, so we will probably be stopping by again with some cards next time we're back on this chunk of 70. TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox
shilorax	Found it	10/20/2012	Stopped to find this cache on our way out to Elephant rocks. While the cache was nice, the highlight was finding a walking stick (the bug!).	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox
rainbow_guyz	Found it	9/30/2012	In Missouri for work-related training. Free time over the weekend so rented a motor car for the two days. Goals for day two: EarthCaches in Illinois and Missouri. I’ve logged EarthCaches in twenty-three states thus far. States to date: CA, HI, MI, NY, WA, OH, WI, AL, IA, PA, GA, KY, VT, CT, RI, MA, NH, ME, WY, CO, UT, KS and MO (Kansas and Missouri yesterday). Illinois will be #24 on the list. Hope to get at least one EarthCache in all fifty states someday. Made the dash over for this smiley face whilst stopped for the “Graham Cave” earthcache (GC28VWC). Dropped off a Travel Bug – a Special Olympics medal meant to spread the word about the organization. The Travel Bug originated in NY and is supposed to travel the world. Also left a collectible pathtag. It is getting dark so this is the last smiley face of the day. TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox
City Slicker	Found it	9/20/2012	We began our trip to Missouri from Cincinnati where I am scheduled to officiate at my nephew's wedding. Due to some physical issues, frequent stops are welcome, and even more so when there are caches nearby to collect. I try to select a spot that has a cache so I can get the blood back into my toes and work out the kinks while I add one more to my tally. We stopped here and it was a quick find for Team Roth, which is how I signed the log for those I found, as well as adding my own name to the log. I like quick and short hikes like this one. Thanks for the refreshing break and another cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox

DellsF4m	Found it	6/3/2012	Out camping at the SP for the event going on that took place Saturday. A few people told me that I hike right by this cache, while en route to completion of the multi-cache placed here at the park. So, after resting up and getting hungry geotykes fed, I was able to go down and find this cache. It's a nice feeling to clean out a park -- even if there is only 3 to find. :) Even picked up some litter en route. So, I am going to count this on my CITO TB. TNLN. TFTC. SL.

We didn't do our homework before we left so weren't prepared with postcards to leave, but did take an addressed one to drop in the mail from Cape Girardeau (not completely sure I understand the process for the postcards).

Our Goal is to get the oldest activate cache MINGO (GC30). It is a 1200+ mile adventure one way. We will also target a few other old caches in our states along the way. With such a long drive ahead, we are limiting ourselves to rest stops caches and a few easier ones along our driving route. A great time with good friends, collecting lots of fun Memories!

We left Wednesday morning at ohhhhh myyyy gooooodnesssss early 5am. This was after a full nights sleep of a whole 2 hours due to getting fun, crazy, adventure off work at 1am... We will return sometime Sunday or Monday. We are heading out to find at least 5 caches placed in 2000 and hit 12 different states on this trip. We will travel about 3500 miles, this is really amazing considering there are 4 kids in the car and everyone is on facebook either playing games or keeping the folks back home amused... This has got to be one of the best caching trips ever!! So far it has been non stop fun since we left. I am sure glad I did not miss this one! This was our last cache of the day... We get breakfast at 6am and then leave for yet I'm sure another fun, crazy, adventure filled day... AWSOME!!! Day 2 of our MINGO adventure... Yes it has become a full circle helarious trip... Tripped getting out of the car this morning is not a great way to start off the day... but yes after getting breakfast and getting started on our adventure to MINGO, at our second cache stop I go to get out of the car and trip on the little lip at the floorboard... everyone got a good chuckle and I was more then used to giving it out.. LOL.. alot more of the banter back and forth just like if you had four kids in your own car, and you know there would be so don't kid yourself with denying it. We had a great day and got the 2 more year 2000 caches today and alot more milage covered. We even found a nice BIG hill in Kansas and I never knew Kansas was anything but flat... WOW... was that a big hill... got the cache and kept going... We passed miles and miles of GIANT windmills... I did figure out whenever Zooming Boomers drives it rains... Hmm I think he should stay a passanger while we are in Colorado... We don't want any SNOW tomorrow...!! :) Well we found MINGO and man it was worse then in the car... Four kids all jumping over the cache like it was an unwrapped christmas present that was ment just for them...!!! OMG, was it a GREAT TIME I am so glad I made the time to come along.. We had to spend at least an hour taking pictures with our cache milestones here and each person with the cache and group photos... Oh yea... Lets not forget the temp was 40 degrees and VERY COLD outside... and YES if your looking at the group photo Levidan DOES HAVE SHORTS ON...!!! CRAZY... we were all freezing by the time we were all done and got back in the car to go on to the next cache, When all of a sudden Levidan hollers out STOP, STOP... I need to get another photo... LOL... that was the best... so after another photo we were on the road again... We headed for mingo2 and then to pizzahut before heading back to the hotel for the night...

Since it wouldn't settle down and it was starting to get dark, I simply used geosense and looked around - Aha! I travel by here every couple of months. I didn't bring my postcards but now I know where the park and the cache are, and want to come back and do the earth cache here also. I'll be sure to put a few postcards in the glovebox so they're already ready for the next trip. Thanks for keeping this up and running!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox

rozebud5	Found it	3/27/2011	Caching in Missouri is a bit different than Colorado. It is definitely squishier and muddier than we are use to. Plus the tree canopy, even without leaves didn't make the GPSr too happy. We got in the right area with the GPS but then had to use geosenses to really find the cache. What caught our eye was purple next to a tree. Turned out to be a bowling ball TB! Of course the boys couldn't just discover it, so we now have a bowling ball to find a place for.

ppcflyersr2	Found it	7/21/2010	Like the others said. The given coordinates was off about 55-60'. I marked this location about 4 times with my Garmin 60CSx and I came up with the coordinate of N 38° 54.188 W 091° 34.636. Other than being off a few feet it was a fun search. My 9 yr old son and I enjoyed the cache and then hiking to the entrance of Graham Cave. The given hint helped a lot. I will try to post a couple of pics of the find.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox
GN&D	Found it	7/18/2010	Thankfully some one had posted new coords, they were within 10' of the cache. Perhaps the owner should update them on the page as it's 93' away from the posted coords.

Papa Lar	Found it	7/5/2010	A fun find. The Cache had an ants nest covering it. Nice to find an older cache. i will upload some pictures soon. We may sop in to camp here sometime. A nice quiet campground. Although not much for swimming. :) Picked up a couple TB's to send along their way. The Coordinates are off a little. See earlier log for closer numbers.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox
benji55545	Didn't find it	5/30/2010	Whacked through some high grass to get to GZ and didn't even find the cache. I wish I'd read old logs before, because it seems the coords are 40 or 50 ft. off. Here's some coords someone posted in a previous log so they're closer to the top: N 38° 54.186 W 091° 34.632. Maybe I'll return at some point. Visited the cave which was cool. Found two ticks on me about 20 minutes later, which was not cool.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox

Fuzzy one	Found it	10/23/2009	WeRV wanted to see this cave and since we were staying just south of there, decided to drive over. Still cold and very wet. We went up to the cave via the trail by the waterfall. It was great! Rain was good for something. Got to cave and WeRV forgot his camera. So back to RV. Decided we would walk some of the trails, and since there was a cache nearby, thought we would try to find it. Still raining. iPhone doesn't work the best out here trying to find these things, but it does get us close. WeRV brought his Garmen running GPS, and using the iPhone to find the coordinates, and by letting Gaarmen tell us where we were, WeRV found this one. On our third trip out we got it. I think we got lucky, but we are counting it as a good find. Signed in and TNLN. This is a very nice state park. Go check it out.Thanks.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox

Marmot had it more like 60 feet to the south, but no matter. Not being sure about the postcard directions and not having any postcards at hand, Marmot took nothing, but left a travel bug.

Unitzoid	Found it	7/26/2009	Moore to the East #3 (5:09 PM) A helpful hint from the logs helped locate this one. It's a bit off from the original coordinates but in a well-fitted spot keeping it out of prying muggle eyes. But do watch out for the spiders - a good walking or regular stick should help out with forging your path to ground zero. Very cool idea. I left a pair of postcards (sorry they're not identical, but they highlight the same location) to keep this cache rolling. I hope one makes its destination one day. ^_^ Took a pair of postcards, left the same.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox
Reform676	Found it	7/18/2009	I grew up in Montgomery Co. and we used to visit Graham Cave State Park often. We were camping here this weekend. Our trial run with a 5th wheel camper we bought a few months ago. We found the cache after a 15 minute search of the area. I prepared and left 2 sets of postcards. There were none in the cache prepared to mail so we took nothing. Thanks for hiding this cache! from Fulton, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCF985_graham-cave-mailbox

I can't find any recent responses about maintaining this cache so for the time being it will be archived and removed from the active cache listings. We are no longer leaving caches stay disabled for extended periods of time. Groundspeak and the geocaching community appreciate your contributions to geocaching and I hope to see this cache back in operation soon. If you can get it back up and running in the next week or so contact me to get it re-listed. Otherwise plan to move it slightly and set up a new cache page. [B][green]Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published.

Mongo	Temporarily Disable Listing	11/13/2012	[b][u][red]OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED[/b][/u][/red] Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last several logs on this cache it appears that this cache is in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the [red][b]”NEEDS MAINTENANCE”[/b][/red] attribute is showing you will need to do the following. http://tinyurl.com/y8n7vuy Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and will be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

TupperMomma	Found it	1/8/2011	My nephew was in town on a visit from Twenty-Nine Palms, California. Over lunch while talking, I asked him if he had heard of Geocaching... He had not, so I explained it to him the best I could (I am a newbie). I told him there is a cache nearby, so after lunch we were on the hunt. I did not need to use the GPS for this hunt as I am from the area & know the location of the tomb. My nephew is the one who actually found the cache container. It was a fun find for both of us, even though we were freezing and it was sleeting on us. Thanks!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

kbh3rd	Write note	5/9/2010	I wasn't planning on going to Potosi today, so I didn't look up this cache before leaving. But when I found myself there I recalled your wonderful short history of Potosi & Moses Austin, which I greatly enjoyed. So I kept my eye out and spotted what I thought must be the tomb while driving along Highway 8 in the middle of town. So we circled around and found it. Not just the Austins' tomb but the whole cemetery & adjoining 178-y.o. church are a treat for history buffs. I didn't look for the cache, but thanks for sending me that way. I put a picture of the tomb in Moses Austin's article on Wikipedia.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

We also got to weehow estensive tis cemetary is. When we were last here, the area was shrouded in darkness and much of the stones were totally unnoticed.

Gmalibby	Found it	8/16/2009	Like so many other loggers, I was out to conquer Washington County, my last of the day and my last of a four day journey. I arrived after dark but decided to try it anyway. Had my own little battle here as I managed to fall on my head. I do it pretty often but had managed the whole trip without falling once. I was squatting down on the cement trying to peer under a rose bush holding the flashlight and the GPS when I got top heavy and tumbled over on my forehead. My thought was..what a perfect place to konk out. Save time and money getting me to the cemetery. Actually I can't even find a bruise. But it makes it memorable for me. Then I discovered when I got back on the road that I had left my Garmin there. So back I went. I was surprised I had not roused the neighbors, but no porch lights came on, no dogs barked, no cop cars cruised by. Thanks for a great adventure and good cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

fiddlish+Reedman	Found it	7/10/2009	Oh, we sweated this cache so much -- it is the only do-able one in the county, and it was the last county we needed. The sigh of relief when we located the container was enormous. We even took a moment to look around -- the history is so interesting. We also noticed that there seem to be an amazing number of churches in Potosi -- and beautiful structures at that. We'd be interested in knowing just how many there are! Thanks for your efforts to research this subject and place the cache. We enjoyed finding it more than you can imagine!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

zeroremorse	Found it	12/31/2008	Visited this site a couple of times before I started GC'ing. This is a micro cache consisting of a black film canister with a scroll for a log. The weather was beautiful for my visit, and I was able to find the cache very easily. Log was wet, so I was not able to sign it. It is very interesting to walk among some of the very old graves adjacent to Moses Austin's tomb. I was able to take several interesting photos while visiting this area. I would like to revisit in the future to sign the log once it dries out a bit. Fun, and educational experience. TNLN TFTC. P.S. I did straighten some of the flags around the tomb.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb
twilight rabbit	Found it	10/29/2008	Grabbed this nice cache after leaving Columbia early this morning on a trip to Florida. Taking the lesser traveled roads when we can, so this leg brought us to this great cache. Thanks for placing it. The log was SOAKED, I think because the container was on it's side, so I left a new sheet that should hold it for a while. I think it will be better if finders will leave the container upright.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

TrooperRob	Temporarily Disable Listing	5/4/2006	I've decided to archive this cache for the time being. Unfortunately, I've had difficulty with people stealing it. When I have time I will try to find a more secure hiding spot at this location, because it is an awesome view.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
YWORRYDOG	Didn't find it	5/2/2006	Thanks for the view, but yes it was gone.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
Dr. Silver Streak	Didn't find it	5/2/2006	I tried to locate this one on my return trip to Springfield from KC. Found the cave and the tree, but no cache. I see a place where the cache may have been, but it looks like muggles have taken it. Sorry!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
aaromash	Didn't find it	4/16/2006	I must have missed the other cachers. I looked for this thing for at least an hour. In a way I was very relieved to find someone else had logged a dnf. I hope this one can come back since I am sure we will be fishing in the area again. (We got 15 catfish between the three of us) [This entry was edited by aaromash on Monday, April 17, 2006 at 12:51:56 PM.] [This entry was edited by aaromash on Monday, April 17, 2006 at 12:53:03 PM.]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
NixaDudes	Didn't find it	4/16/2006	Three of us combed this area for 45 minutes with no luck...wish we would have known it may be missing! The cave was cool and the site a bit scarey...perfect for 2 cocky teenagers in tow. hope you are able to replace or workout a muggle-proof location.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
Hiker Biker	Write note	4/13/2006	I found this cache on a trip around the beginning of March. I went back to Kansas City with a geo-caching friend the first week of April and stopped so she could find the cache and IT WAS GONE!!! So sorry to let you know, but it definitely was not in the same location as it had been before. And it seems like you even had it fastened to the ground if I remember correctly when I found it in March. If you have moved it, that is great, but if you haven't, then it is missing in action. Sorry I didn't tell you sooner, but I kept forgetting.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
tyella	Found it	3/24/2006	The coolest cache of the day! Great view and a neat cave! Didn't see a travelbug in the box.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
sawblade5	Found it	3/22/2006	I found it for my 64th find and it was so far my toughest one to get to. I was fooled by the 1.5 difficulty level which should be a 2 or 2.5 from how well its hidden. But don't be fooled by the level 4 for terrain it is there and its can be dangerous if you don't watch out and hold on tight. T- Arnie TB so he can make his way back up to Nebraska. Also Inch TB made a visit here. PS: On ClarJar's rating system I found the rating for this to be a 2/4.25 so its pretty close to what is above.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
Hiker Biker	Found it	3/6/2006	Found this on my way to Kansas City. I can understand why you might have to be very careful in wet weather. Nice view though. Left Arnie Travel Bug which I picked up in Nebraska and took the Disney Travel Bug.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
7 Hamburglars	Found it	2/1/2006	Traveled the high road and climb down right over it...I first saw a lock and thought it was from the cache but soon saw what "secured" really meant. The notes were so clear and informative I really didn't need the GPSr once I got to the parking area. Nice area, I wish I had a cave to go to like that when I was a teenager! T: Bear TB, pen light L: Robert's TB, McDonald's Gift Certificate. I thought it was too exposed and I place more rocks around the cache. As I was driving out some Amish folks were looking me over...not sure if they had a GPSr in their buggy...could have been mugglers! I think I was stealth enough though. TFTC!

wablocouple	Didn't find it	12/31/2005	4 adults & 2 kids looked for an hour. I believe it is missing. Always want to go to the cave though.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
BSENGLER	Didn't find it	12/28/2005	I think that this cache has either been found by the obvious partiers that go there or has fell down the cliff. We looked for like an hour and a half at this location all up and down the sid eof this cliff and did not find it. If it is still there it was hid really really well we looked in,under,and above everything.I think that there is a reason it hasn't been found in so long. bsengler	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
C&Tenterprises	Found it	11/25/2005	Went looking with my brother and found it after a short search. Very interesting! Left the Buy.com Travel Bug. The cave was neat and I can see why it is a party spot for local teens.

copperhead282	Found it	11/6/2005	Down to St. Clair County to try and find property for sale. Checked geocaching.com prior to leaving and thought I would give this one a try. Copperhead Jr. and the mother did not find the idea to be one they wanted to try so they sent me to go it alone. Great place for a cache and gave me more wonderful pictures to add to my collection. Found cache @ 1445 hrs. The cache was laying out in the open and standing on it's end. It was just a matter of inches from falling down the cliff side and into the Lake. All the contents were still inside and in great shape. I hid the cache away from where I found it so that Trooper Rob could get it back to where it was originally hid. Thanks for a great cache and cache site. TN - LN - SL copperhead282 (Ptrl. Sgt. S.

dbug	Found it	9/10/2005	Nice cache. We found it very easily. took the high road in and found it very easy goiing. We liked the cave, but was afaid of finding snakes. DBug	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
Paul Lamble	Didn't find it	9/10/2005	OUCH! I sought this cache on Saturday morning but had no luck. What I found instead was a very pugnacious wasp guarding the cache. I was stuck twice by this defensive little beastie before I stumbled back in pain and anger. Tell me that the cache is still there and I will return for it in the winter months. Also, if this is the party cave for the locals, how do they get back home after they've had a few beers? That path was treacherous enough sober and in the daylight.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
ljsgofish	Found it	7/24/2005	I agree with harleygirl this was a awesome cache...we found it fairly easily but had to watch the little one on the rocks...10 is about the right age for this not much younger. Took small maracca and let compass, flag pin. and bug wipes. Met a STATE PATROLMAN on the way out...He asked us if we were OK...we told him we had been geo caching and he looked at us like we were from another plane!!! We gave him a flyer that explains the game but I think he is still scratching his head.....HA CRAZY GRANDMA/ljsgofish	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
teamharleygirlsx4	Found it	7/23/2005	AWESOME!!!!!! We loved this cache. It was a fun challenge. The cave was sooooo cool. It reminded me of somethin out of the book Clan of the Cave Bear.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller

theboonieman	Found it	7/6/2005	Wow! I have to admit this place is really cool and we had a great time looking for the cache. Wish there wasn't so much darn poison ivy around.

TheGilby4	Found it	6/11/2005	Minnesota going to Branson for vacation, and this was the highlight of my two and a half year old daughters car ride. Quite risky carry over to the cave, but her smile was worth it. picked up a compass on the trail that people in the log book said they left. We left it again!!! We took a little cat puzzle for our daughter. Thanks for such an awesome cache location, TheGilby3	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
Sola Fide	Found it	6/11/2005	This is a really neat cache. I agree with the owner young children shouldn't go on this one. Cache is in good shape and ready for the next cacher.

Lone White Wing Dove	Found it	5/13/2005	10:30am - W/ Wife - It had rained most of the night and parts were very slick. Wife sent me alone. I found it and brought it back to her under the bridge. It took me about 15 minutes to get it in the slippery, muddy conditions. She decided she wanted to see the cave, so she went with me when I returned it. It took us about 40 minutes to return it and make it back to the bridge! She still doesn't know if she enjoyed the trip or not.

MOphoto	Found it	4/17/2005	Excellent cache. I can't believe there are so few in this area. I grew up and went to school in Osceola, and was back visiting family. May have to place some near in the future as there's so much around to see and do. TNLNSL	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
KaiserKlan	Found it	4/2/2005	Deb and I with Pat McCalman were on a balloon chase after which we stopped on our way home for this cache.

Firefighter's Wife	Found it	1/21/2005	4th & final cache of the day. Found with no difficulty, though the hill was pretty slick from snow meltoff over the last several days. T: Fanny Pack, L: Signature flag sticker, 2 flag pins & an orange blaze vest. FYI, someone had signed the log earlier in the day saying that they had stumbled on the cache accidentally. He traded items & signed the log. Who ever he was did an EXCELLENT job of recovering it. Perhaps a future geocacher in the making.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller

We took the toy Mickey Mouse and left an original poem I wrote for my Dad many years ago. If you find this and read it and would like to read more, you can look on the fanstory.com site for DINY as author.

RecSpecialist	Found it	11/5/2004	Awesome location - always wanted to stop by and check out the cave but never took the chance. Didn't have no problem finding it. Definately not a place to take young ones. Took "Star Wars" puzzle and left a toy truck. RecSpecialist - Rogersville, Missouri	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
larry202br	Found it	9/19/2004	Finally made it back to this one, and found it quite easily. I was misled before by some of the logs, and I was looking way too high before.

outonalimb1	Found it	8/9/2004	RB and family from Lincoln and Omaha NE found this one. Nice place. If you look very carefully you will see a skeleton of a bat still hanging there.

roelsch	Didn't find it	7/19/2004	Geocaching with NGA Dude while on vacation at the Lake of the Ozarks. The terrain and vegetation made this one tougher than we had thought. We negotiated our way to the area of the cache, but didn't find it after a couple of minutes searching. We were falling behind schedule, so we reluctantly abandoned this one. Thanks anyway, TrooperRob! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller

Shbear	Found it	6/26/2004	Great cache, made it harder by not reading previous logs and coming from below. Took the high road out and was fairly simple. The cache was visible from twenty feet away, so hid it better. Other wise in great condition and a wonderful view. Took a key ring and left a geo-button. Thanks.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
ooga booga	Found it	6/20/2004	This is a good little cache. I made the mistake that I think several others have made in that I started too low and had to work my way up, but once I got in the area it wasn't too much trouble to find the cache. I was surprised at how fast the current was moving on the surface of the lake - the twigs and debris floating on top were really scooting right along. I signed in and a did a bit of CITO on the way out, but the place was fairly clean compared to a lot of other local party spots. Thanks!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
GentleWhisper	Found it	6/13/2004	I talked my two traveling companions into stopping for this 'quick' cache on the way back from a KC Royals game. We were definitely not dressed for the occasion. My longtime friend chickened out pretty soon. Her 16 year old friend, who I just met today, wasn't about to quit on her first cache hunt... even though she was wearing flip-flops and isn't an 'outdoors person.' We went the wrong way... up instead of down. But finally figured it out and found the cave and cache. It's a great cache, in good condition, and well stocked. I'm so glad, I didn't want Joy's first caching experience to end with a broken gladware container filled with business cards and expired coupons. Thanks so much, besides finding a great cache, I've also re-learned never to go caching without pants, bug spray and real shoes ... maybe that's just a personal preference... is it kind of itchy in here, or is that just me? P.S. I think Joy really enjoyed her unexpected adventure, she seems interested in caching again.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
P-3 Nav	Found it	6/5/2004	I was looking forward to visiting this cache because I had been reading some information that indicated this arm of Truman Lake was part of a 12-mile-diameter crater from a meteorite impact. I'm no geologist, but the thought of being near such a place excited me. Today was sunny and warm, so the footing was sure. We initially climbed too high. My son found the cache at 1140 as we made our way back down. Took two Junior Trooper stickers, left a foam dog stamp and a WheresGeorge dollar. This part of the lake must be the fast lane. While we were there, several boats ran up the channel at high speed. [b]PiTs Factor[/b] (Poison Ivy, Ticks, Stickerburrs): [b]3-2-1[/b]. I only saw a single bush of poison ivy, but it was right in the pathway near the pipe crossing, therefore hard to avoid. The two of us only saw one tick apiece, and they were just crawling around, and had not attached themselves.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller

byonke	Found it	3/13/2004	We found this with little trouble. The cache was in good condition and well stocked. We took a 'biner, left a Rusty Wallace key chain and signed the log. I've been up and down this highway many times and had never seen this from the road although it is clearly visible. Thanks Brian and Carlin Liberty, MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller
mjrash	Didn't find it	3/10/2004	Just not my day, today finding caches. Parked on the County road just North of the bridges. Took a long stroll from my parking place to the bluff. Didn't read any spoilers so didn't realize the cache was in the vicenity of the cave. As I peered off of the edge of the bluff, I wondered why I was still 32 feet from the coordinates. After exhausting my mom inlaw and myself searching all of the old foundations on the bluff and discussing wheather the former occupants of these dwellings had kids and no yard to play in, just happened onto the trail that cut down the bluff to the cave area. Got down there but did not look past the cedar. Man, Truman has quite a current in it here. Funny, until this day I did not realize that the Lake had a current in it at Osceola.

GN&D	Found it	3/2/2004	Make that [b]4 FTF's[/b] in two days. And this was one heck of a cache! We went down to do 14 caches in our southern region today, but since I know who TR is (although not personally), we took the extra time to shoot over to Osceola and check this one out. We didn't realize we would get a FTF, so that was a bonus. Man this is a great cache, not only because it's an "adrenaline rush type" cache, but the area is beautiful. We highly recommend this cache to all those who pass through the area! The extra trip over there was worth it, and thanks for a great time !!

*gln	Write note	2/29/2004	Congratulations Trooper Rob. Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and hopefully you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been approved!! As a cache placer,* you * have the ability to improve (or degrade) the quality of Geocaching in your area. I hope that this cache will be a positive addition. One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one here guy with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . Looks fun, Enjoy! Cheers & Thanks for your contributions to Geocaching, **Glenn, your friendly neighborhood GC.com Admin.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHT0Y_cave-dweller

Know Future	Archive	1/8/2006	Sorry to have taken so long to respond - had a lot of other projects that had to be taken care of before Christmas vacation, and have only been back a couple of days now. Reviewed the coordinates of your cache, and it appears that the person sending you the note is right. There is a private parcel (about 31 acres) in that area, and the SE and NE corners of your cache are located on that parcel. Close as I can tell without spending a lot of time on it, the cache itself is on National Forest land, but it is so close to the boundary that persons seeking it could easily trespass onto private land. For more detail, you might want to view one of the Forest Service topographic maps, or the Madison county land ownership plat book. Nancy Feakes, Recreation Manager Mark Twain National Forest 573-364-4621 x472 To: nfeakes@fs.fed.us 12/07/2005 10:31AM Subject: Fw: [GEO] mikesdx contacting you from Geocaching.com Hello Ms. Feakes, RE: T-BONE’S SILVER MINE CACHE (GCHYGA) I received this email (see below) the other day. I don't know the sender. I was surprised that this person claims that it is on private property. I know there are private land parcels throughout the Mark Twain forest, but I didn't think there were any in this area. Here are the lat/lon values for all the parts of this cache: SW COR: N 37° 33.200 W 090° 27.113 SE COR: N 37° 33.302', W 90° 26.842' NW COR: N 37° 33.288', W 90° 27.180' NE COR: N 37° 33.384', W 90° 26.898' CACHE: N 37° 33.308', W 90° 26.996' Would it be possible for you to compare these locations to an official land ownership map and tell me which, if any, locations are on private lands? If necessary I will relocate the waypoints or disable the cache. I'd like to know the status of each location before I take any action.

There was no problem with the claim and I walked right by the monument on one of the criss crossings through the woods. I hate to tell you, T-Bone, that area looks pretty used up. If you could commercialize Poison Ivy we could be rich!

roelsch	Found it	6/4/2005	Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on the "One Year After The Fall" tour of southeast Missouri. Logging the Center. We had this one on our route for last year about this time, but never got around to doing it. We put this one in front of [/I]Pop Quiz[/I], figuring that no matter what else happened we'd get to log it this time around.

We started at the SW corner, worked our way counterclockwise around the perimeter and signed the paper work.

Just down the trail we were greeted by the remains of some formerly living creature. Maybe it was a warning to those who try to encroach on the mine.

I mentally slapped myself as I entered a parking lot and began looking around for the cache. A gentleman working at the hardware store immediately knew what I was up to and pointed me in the right direction. Finding the cache was cake after that. Once the log was signed and the cache replaced, I inquired as to a good place to grab a bite to eat. Several were suggested, but one with an interesting name had to be visited at some point during this caching adventure. Took nothing, left nothing.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCM6PM_mine-car

68spatz	Found it	9/4/2010	Neat place. The owner of the property busted us. Very nice lady, talked about the history of the family business as well as the "mine cart" that turned out to be a tar cart. She said they used to light a fire under the cart to heat the tar ( you can see the remains of the smoke stack coming out the front of the cart). Once the tar was heated they would carry the buckets of hot tar up a ladder and seal the roofs around Troy. She said the cart had a lot of memories and was very dear to her. I thanked her for sharing this treasure with us. On the way out we also got busted by the owner of this cache, great guy, had a pleasant talk.

Aparently we weren't careful enough about the muggles because right when we finally found the caches, up came 3 police cars. They said they got a report on 3 suspicious people poking around. Aprently the confidential informant didn't tell the police that one of the people was an 8 year old.

lake_wannabees	Found it	4/2/2008	This was difficult to grab. I pulled up and started checking out the cache site. A lady came out of a nearby store bearing about 20 sacks. She asked if she could help me. I said I was just trying to figure out what the thing was so she dropped her bags and came over to give me more details than I ever wanted. She finally went back to her car but was on the phone so I pulled out the camera to use that as a stall. She ran back into the store about the time I spotted the cache. I had a devil of a time trying to extract it and finally thought if I took a pic and sent it to the owner, maybe that would work. The lady left just as I was ready to pull out. As I made the turn onto the main street I came with another idea of how to extract the cache, circled the block and voila. I finally got the cache out so I could sign it. This was a portent of things to come today.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCM6PM_mine-car

The Webbs	Found it	4/20/2008	What a neat thing! We were hiking with our Spring-Bluff forestry 4-H group and some of the kids found this. None of us had any idea what it was, when we opened it we first thought it was some small child's "treasures". We checked the book hoping to find a name or something to maybe try and track him down to return it. Thankfully there was a very nice letter telling us what it was and about the website. We had no idea that there even was anything like this. We're a family who loves to hike and I'm thinking our 4-H group will be on the lookout for more of these fun treats. We put the log-book in a Wal-mart bag cause the other bag is quite torn and we left a whistle,compass combo.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
roelsch	Found it	3/29/2008	Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on a trip down I-44 on the last Saturday of March, 2008. We'd started this one eons ago, it seems, and were on the wrong side of the river that [i]Streets and Trips[/i] doesn't even acknowledge is there last time – without enough time in the day to find the right way to the cache. No problems this time. We wondered whether we'd run into high water, but had no problems with that. We could see evidence of the high water mark here and there, but overall the park is in good shape. Mean Gene found the cache essentially out in the open next to the boardwalk. A note in the log indicated that the cache was found by River Rangers while they were cleaning up the area, and that they'd [i]almost[/i] tossed the cache in the trash. Luckily they recognized it for what it was and returned it. After we'd signed the log, we returned it to the location that was indicated in the hint. TNLNSL. Thanks, JustJen & Matt! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
Mean Gene	Found it	3/29/2008	Caching with Roelsch down I-44 on a quest for Roelsch’s cache #5000. We started this one back on May 6, 2006 and almost got to the final but Streets and Trips took us to the wrong side of the river and we ran out of time for the day a mere 1500 feet from the cache. We were concerned about the flood at the final given the proximity to the river but it was not a factor. As I approached the coordinates I spotted the cache on the ground next to the walkway. Someone identifying himself as River Ranger found the cache and almost threw it in the trash but signed the log instead. We replaced the cache where the hint indicated. The log is damp and the bag is ripped. Took nothing and left nothing. Good job. Thanks, JustJen & Matt, for placing this cache. – Mean Gene and the Rooter, St. Louis MO	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
Family of Pirates	Didn't find it	3/24/2008	Due to the amazing flood that hit the area most of the roads were closed that would have brought us close to the cache.We are not from this area...and new to geocaching... we learned how important it is to have a proper topo map installed since I found a road that brought me within .5 miles ...after an hour of walking in the woods we discovered that we were on the opposite side of the river ! It was a great day that allowed us to find a group of blue heron nests and it give us a funny story to share.

Once down the hill my GPSr bounce all around but I deduced were the final was. Neat cave at the final. Thanks! Tollybrew	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour

JustJen & Matt	Temporarily Disable Listing	7/24/2007	Received a message that there is a problem with this cache. We will check on it soon.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
J K A Z	Didn't find it	7/16/2007	I think the critter took the cache at crooked tree again. Found the view and tree but no 35mm canister. Found WP 2 from clue. Found the next huge cave and mammoth rock, but no canister here either so couldn't go on to WP 4. Did enjoy the hiking and the caves but not the temp. or MO-squitos. TFTH	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
kingdom treasures	Found it	4/21/2007	The first WP we could not find anywhere in or near the crooked tree. After reading the last log from April 3, it makes me wonder if a critter moved it again? We found the second WP based just on the clues since we did not have the coordinates from the first WP. The last WP was a little confusing about which "paved trail" to take. We did finally find it and took 2 refrigerator magnets and left a YO-YO and a miniature flashlight. We had two kids.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
scoutingitout	Found it	4/3/2007	Down for some climbing and caching. We really enjoyed this cache. The first stage stumped us for quite a while until our future daughter inlaw found it burried in some leaves down hill from the tree. It looked like some critter had left some tooth marks in it. We left it in the crooked tree where we thought it should be. The other stages were in good shape. We enjoyed exploring the caves there were some very nice formations. We were disapointed at the number of them that were broken off. (some people don't know how to leave nature for others to enjoy) We are glad that JustJen and Matt brought us on this little tour. TFTC Dave & Jeri (scoutingitout)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
Three Day Weekend	Found it	10/21/2006	Great series of caves. I really enjoyed the next to last cave the most, except I had to wait on a group of kids playing "Fort" in the cave to leave. Had a good time. Met a group of cavers coming out of the last cave, covered in red clay mud....I wasn't going to get that involved...Thanks for the hide.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
JustJen & Matt	Owner Maintenance	10/17/2006	Meramec Cave Tour Seems this one is still in place. Was just found on the 14th. Spoke to the finders and they told me where they found the WP. It is still in the correct location.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour

Bean & Weasel	Didn't find it	10/7/2006	Six of us were hunting this one. Found the first two easily and all of us hunted for #3 at the Mammoth Rock for a very long time with no success. We hated to give up on it, but sincerely think maybe WP#3 has been muggled. Were sure disappointed we coudn't get to the final stage. Thanks.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour

GB-Cacher	Found it	7/8/2006	This was nicely done! For the finale, I had to come back about 1.5 hrs later due to someone who decided to take a nap very close to the cache coordinates. Once back, coordinates were dead one. TNLN. GB-Cacher	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
moondoggie13	Found it	6/17/2006	Found all caches but WP4 took us awhile to find. The youngest in the group an eight year old figured out the where to look for WP4. All us older cachers tried several times and were not even close..... Thanks for the great hide.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
Muddskipper	Didn't find it	5/30/2006	It was an adventure...I was camping with my sister and husband in the park. We were there to do some caving. We arrived late, cooked dinner and then decided to some night caching. Park employees said we could hike and cave 24/7. We took the long way to find WP #1. Though it was around 11:00 pm, it was still sweltering hot! A bunch or crazy raccoons chased us on the trail. Yikes! I forgot to mention, we left my husband in the parking lot because he was reading a sign. We finally got to GZ and looked around, but no luck. The hint? Back on the PDA with the, now very upset, husband. We did find something though...a sleepy copperhead! We had to walk all the way back to camp because the husband drove the car back. That's what you get when you leave somebody behind without their own GPSr. After a beer, we figured we try again, this time, just my husband and myself. We did the trail the short way and had the hint. Still no cache, but another sleepy copperhead was found where the hint told us to look. We gave up on the cache. I probably won't be back to this spot, but we had an adventure anyway. Look out for those snakes!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
caver79	Found it	5/22/2006	Found Wp's 2 and 3. Spent an hour looking for WP 4, but did not succeed. This was a good time. Although we did not find WP 4, it still lead my husband and I back to the point of our engagement.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour

roelsch	Write note	5/6/2006	Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on the first weekend in May. We got a good start on this one (well, we should have started by taking the trail to the high side) and found three of the four caves. [i]Streets and Trips[/i] doesn't show roadways inside of parks (why not??) and the topo map wasn't much help either. We ended up on the wrong side of the river and out of time, so we'll have to come back to finish this one.

JanS03	Found it	4/20/2005	Caching with PA and MA today along the I-44 corridor. This was our favorite of the day. The caves were fun to visit even if we didn't explore any of them. Didn't realize there were so many caves open for the public to enjoy. Met ShowMe69 between waypoints, and he teamed up with us for the final. Thanks for another fun cache. JanS03 and LeeS...St. Louis, Mo.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
showme69	Found it	4/20/2005	Great job on this one, Jen and Matt. Just wish I would have went the "correct" way on Walking Fern Trail. It would have saved me a little extra walking. lol. I wanted to do this one before taking troutboy98, since you didn't recommend it for small kids, but I think he'll do fine. I'm going to try to take him there this weekend. We'll do a little cave exploring too. Ran into JanS03, LeeS, Pa and Ma out on the trail and we did the last leg together. I took several photos while doing this one. Took nothing, left a survival whistle with compass. TFTC. [This entry was edited by showme69 on Friday, April 22, 2005 at 10:11:51 AM.]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour

Crowesfeat30, Fobidragon, Didg Guy, Lancelot and I combined to look for this one. At one time or another, I been in three out of four of these caves. Nice to visit them again.

Crowesfeat30	Found it	4/8/2005	Found this today caching with Didg Guy, Sniper1 & Fobidragon. Sniper1 had found WP's 1,2 and 3 on another day but was unable to complete the cache because of a group of Boy Scouts hanging out in the area of the final so he watched Didg, Fobidragon & me find the 1st three & then we headed over to the final. Ran into Lancelot on the way there & he joined us for the signing of the log. Thanx!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour

cubs	Didn't find it	3/26/2005	Its seems to be clear that this one does not want to be found by me. I have been here twice and dod not find even the first waypoint on my first visit although I made it to waypoint 3 on my second visit i could not find it so I tried to go to the end because i knew this area, took cave rescue classes here before the trail even existed.

mocrazygirls	Found it	3/13/2005	We looked for the first clue for two weekends. We finally found it and headed to the second. The second clue was very easy. We found the third one really fast.

talks funny	Found it	3/4/2005	I really enjoyed looking for this one. The caves are always fastinating. Last summer we went on a tour of Fishers cave. It was very interesting. With so many people caching these days I am concerned about the impact on the land surrounding the cache areas. The very descriptive hints you give, will help to minimize this. TNLN!

Sullivan Bob	Found it	1/23/2005	I've lived in Sullivan for 35 years and know this park well. By using the last clue I thought I knew exactly where the cache was. So last week I went there and looked around and did not find it (Its turns out I was in the correct place, but it was well camouflaged). So later on I went to the third clue, which I knew where it was and got the coordinates. Today I went back to where I was originally and found it. By the way, a raccoon is using the same spot as a nest and I had to move him before I found it. Took nothing--left nothing. Thanks	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
thunder_monk	Found it	1/2/2005	This is a very cool cache and a FTF to boot. Had a small problem with WP#1 and emailed the cache owner about it. However I did manage to find the other WPs and took the tour. The trails are very nice and the final walk is very secluded and quiet. I took a few pix at the caves and hope to post a couple here. Took a Guardian Angel keychain and left a thunder token and a geocaching button. Thanks Jen and Matt for a very nice and fun cache....Dan (Thunder) from Rolla	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMC16_meramec-cave-tour
*gln	Write note	12/29/2004	Congratulations JustJen & Matt. Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site. As a cache placer,* you * have the unique ability to improve (or degrade) the quality of Geocaching in your area. I hope that this cache will be a positive addition. One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one guy here with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . [red][b] In addition, since we generaly need to ask permission to place caches in areas like this, I am glad you have already done so. [/red][/b] Looks fun, Enjoy!

scw13402	Found it	12/28/2005	Found cache on 12/27/05 at these way points. 37 01.366N & 094 30.990W Just up the incline from gravel walking trail. It's a small OD green army ammo box and it was at base of rock wall behind some fallen rocks. From recorded reports in the log book inside, it has been found a lot by accident. Box was full of goodies. We took two large corn holders and left a keychain. Tried to email owner of the cache but email came back undeliverable. Hopefully the cache will stay there and live on for others to find.

pdjtreckers	Found it	10/22/2005	We were walking to where the cache was and following the Gps when we saw a family that had found it, we thought they were geocachers and we asked them their geocaching name and the mother just said mom and they didn't sign the log so we figured out they weren't geocachers. One of the little boys thought it was a time capsule, lol. Nice trails neat cave.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCQ3BG_cave-caper

Jeeper Rick	Found it	10/8/2005	Had done the other caches in the area and went to look for this one. Spied a marked trailhead but wasn't sure if it was the one.Turned around and parked and as we got out met the gentleman coming from the trailhead sign. I asked if that was the trail and he said, looking at the printout I had, "see this (pointing to the cache owners name)" and pointed to his hat(which had his name on it). Wow it was the cache owner!!! Any way after some small talk and alittle advice we took off to find the cache.My wife used the clue while I climbed up looking for the cache. With the rocks the GPSr sure does some funny things but I did find the cave. I got my wife to come help me look and it took her about three minutes to spot it, I had walked by it three or four times already!Anyway was a great cache and was nice to meet a owner and fellow cacher out in the field, Thanks for the cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCQ3BG_cave-caper

Took us awhile to find the cache...coords were about 30 yards off. I was about ready to give up and grand-daughter found it, and yes, it is in plain sight if viewed from the right angle. We came back the next day and brought some relatives who where unfamiliar with geocaching and they had a good time and found it right off the bat. Left and Illinois pin, band aid and nice folding heart fan. Took two AA batteries, super glue and ping pong ball. Thanks for bringing us here.

DrewNexus	Found it	8/23/2005	I had a lot of fun at this cache, this also is a late log since i haven't been able to get on here in a while. There were eight of us that went. We found the cache, good place to hide. I never knew these trails were there so i really enoyed them. The cave was a lot fun. We ended walking farther along the trail, took the "loop", but we turned a wrong place somewhere. Ended up on top the natures crack, just kept going, took the actual road back to main, then back down to the road, then eventually back to the car. Needless to say it was a long and un expected venture, over 2 hours of walking straight, but we had a lot of fun. Thanks again.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCQ3BG_cave-caper

*gln	Publish Listing	8/11/2005	Congratulations JayK0ETC. Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site. As a cache placer,* you * have the unique ability to improve (or degrade) the quality of Geocaching in your area. I hope that this cache will be a positive addition. [Green][b] In addition, since we generally need to ask permission to place caches in areas like this, I am tickled green that you have already done so. [/green][/b] Looks fun, Enjoy!

Reviewer of the Cache	Temporarily Disable Listing	5/14/2009	[b][RED]DISABLING CACHE[/b][/RED] Greetings, I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled, or has not been found for a period of time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. When you get a chance, please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it (using the [i]archive listing [/i] link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location. If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b] log a note to the cache [/b] (not email) so I don't archive the listing for non-communication. I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. [b]If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.[/b] If the [B][RED]Needs Maintenance[/B][/RED] attribute is showing you will need to also write a [B][GREEN]Owners Maintenance[/B][/GREEN] note to remove it. http://support.groundspeak.com/Support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&_a=viewarticle&kbarticleid=333&nav=0,5,15 Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team, Glenn (*gln) & Reviewer of the Cache (RotC) [b]Missouri Caches Scheduled to be Archived[/b] http://tinyurl.com/87cqw [b]Caches placed on MDC WITH permission!

mysticindiancelt	Needs Maintenance	5/4/2009	Found in cave one little tin, with soaking wet log. Appears to be a green metal tin like mints come in. Nothing else there.

TripCyclone	Needs Maintenance	4/11/2009	This needs maintenance to repair it back to what the owner intended. While in a great spot and fun to retrieve, the log sheets are soaked and I saw no evidence of a stamp for the letterbox aspect. Not sure if the spot this is hiding in is the intended spot either.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCQ77P_cave-springs
TripCyclone	Found it	4/11/2009	Found this one after some searching around. I was about to give up when I happened to spot it. This doesn't look like the original container as there was no stamp to go with it. Log was so badly wet that I didn't think I could get it out, sign, and get it back in without damage. Took a picture as proof.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCQ77P_cave-springs

The Ravens	Didn't find it	11/8/2008	Found while in KCMO after the WWFM IV. It was cold but one must cache on! Heck with the crickets what about the SPIDERS!! We had an escort to this cache site. I didn't get the co-ords entered into our gps60 correctly and it was taking us way to far west... past the house and I think across the road. At the trail head there were boy scouts camping so when we came back to the truck I ask one of the leaders if he might know about the cave(s). He said no but the boys might. Yes they did and 2 of them walked us down the trail to the cave. Unfortunately we didn't find the cache box. I looked for some time and even used the hint to no avail.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCQ77P_cave-springs

I would have considered developing an EC myself but the visitor center was closed so there was nobody to ask permission from. We found the cache without a flashlight but it wasn't easy.

daven728	Found it	2/1/2009	Found with jd575. Nice little walk with the kids and a good run for our beagle. We saw a lot of animal tracks in the snow, but no wildlife.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCQJ96_lead-mine-
jd575	Found it	2/1/2009	What a great area. We went right as the snow was melting, so it was a muddy trip. We expected this though. There was still snow on the road, so we got to see all the wildlife tracks. I SWEAR I saw bear tracks the whole way to the cache. I found a really nice snow track, and was going to take a picture to share, but my dog got excited and stomped all over it right before I could snap the pic. Bummer. I am by no means a mountain man, or even a novice tracker, so I looked up some pictures of black bear tracks online, and they were pretty similar. It definately had a paw with five "toes," and the entire print had a diameter of about 5". I called a conservation agent to let them investigate if they wish. We saw no wildlife today. My guess is because there is a 2 yr old, a 5 yr old, and a beagle puppy with us. I am sure we sound like a freight train rumbling through the woods. We found the cache no problem, and enjoyed the scenery. I am going to post some pics, but some are pretty close to some that have already been posted. I use this area frequently, and I'm quite sure Lead Mine will be the place for my first cache. Thanks for the great walk!!!

I had planned on driving on to Bennett springs for a couple of more cache finds, but ended up spending three hours near this site watching the Bald Eagles feed in the river below. I was glad I brought my binoculars and camera. I also saw the carved face in the tree stump along the road. I decided to drive over to the Lead Mine Cellar Cache that has been archived to verify that it was missing before going home. I poked around for 10 minutes and didn't find it so I'm guessing it is gone. Interesting place.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCQJ96_lead-mine-

travel8r	Found it	2/21/2006	OK, have to clarify directions for those of us who are "challenged" drivers. Do NOT turn in when you see the "Leadmine Conservation Area" sign - continue going straight on that YY that becomes Jughead Road. Sounds easy enough, but I was so excited when I saw the sign, I immediately turned in and I spent a very long time driving around. But boy, did I have fun on those roads with my CRV, dipping through meandering creekbeds flowing over the road! Once I got to the right location, walk was very enjoyable. I am posting a picture of a little "artwork" someone did on a tree about 300 feet before the cache site, still on the path. It is a cute little woodspirit, and it is right in front of a great view.

Knob Creek	Found it	11/4/2005	I had a great day at Lead Mine. Nice walk to the cache. Great views near cache. This cache is a good example of what caching is all about. Special spot, good hike, good container with nice swag all in plastic bags. Good coords also. The fall color was excellent today. When I was about to sign the log, I heard voices coming up the trail. That really suprised me as far back in the woods as I was. I rehid quickly and walked up near the trail. I said hello to some hikers, then I went back and signed the log.

*gln	Publish Listing	9/14/2005	Congratulations shabri9. Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site. As a cache placer,* you * have the unique ability to improve (or degrade) the quality of Geocaching in your area. I hope that this cache will be a positive addition. One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one guy here with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . [Green][b] In addition, since we generally need to ask permission to place caches in areas like this, I am GLAD have already done so. [/green][/b] Looks fun, Enjoy!

travel8r	Found it	2/21/2006	Boy, did I manage to get myself lost out in the Leadmine conservation area! When you finally do find yourself in the right spot for this one, it is only about 100 feet from where you can park. Spring was very neat, and the little glen was absolutely magical - I expected Bambi to come out. The birds and squirrels were so thick in the area, I just had to sit and watch and listen for a while. The whole 3 1/2 hours or so that I was out driving and walking around the area, I never saw another car or person. I did, however, interrupt the squirrel on top of the cache! It has been chewed on, but currently seems to be water tight. TNLNSL, Great little area! Picked up a bag of trash before leaving. Is this the second container that has been chewed on here?? Squirrel was literally on top of it when I found it. Might have to get a metal ammo box. TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCR6J4_lead-mine-cellar

Knob Creek	Found it	11/12/2005	First to find!!!! I was up here last week and didn't realize there was another cache at Lead Mine. I was really happy and suprised to be the first to find. I was deer hunting today. I didn't see any deer while hunting, ( saw a few on the roads in and out) I did find a cache though!!!! Found with my wife and brother, it was his first cache find. Thanks for placing another cache here. I thought the cellar was really neat. It made me wonder about the history of the area. I was glad this cache was close to the road, that way I didn't mess up anyones deer hunt. I like the hike at the other Lead Mine cache though, I just didn't has time to hike today, so it all worked out good. Took nothing, left a White Jeep travel bug.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCR6J4_lead-mine-cellar

wanderfish	Found it	4/12/2015	In town visiting from Lawrence, KS and here for muggle life activities scheduled for last night we decided to make a geocaching weekend of it. Our plans for today are to light up some new Missouri counties on our map, caching our way up to Columbia and start out the first half of the SFT geotrail tomorrow while caching on the way back toward home. Woke up this morning at the normal work day time to get an early start. There's nothing we love more than caching in a new , unexplored neck of the woods! We arrived and found the cache just as the sun started to break through the rain clouds again. This marks our 12th find of the day around 1:30pm on a rainy, 55 degree April Sunday afternoon. Thank you for our 3384th find.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCTVX4_jacobs-cave-cache
Unitzoid	Found it	4/11/2015	Ozark Overture #12 (2:40 PM) Following the discovery of a few caches around Manito Lake, our geocaching group (Arthur & Trillian, Tony Banks, DPHickey and I) contemplated where to go next. I pointed out this listing further down the road; it was an older hide that none of us had yet to visit. We briefly returned to Tipton so that I could pick up my car as my schedule was more detached than the others. Winding roads eventually opened up to a clearing. We parked in the designated location and quickly noted how depressed the area appeared geologically. Quite interesting! We walked to the coordinates and found the cache with no trouble at all. Some time was spent looking over older logs and commenting on familiar handles. Once the container was replaced, we couldn't help but notice the number of fossils on the stones nearby. Some even eluded our identification. Returning to the cars, we considered our next destination. Was there time to seek other nearby hides? Continuing on to Laurie seemed like a good option; many of us hadn't driven this stretch of highway 5. We resolved to find "just a few more" . . . Took nothing, left nothing.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCTVX4_jacobs-cave-cache
Tony Banks	Found it	4/11/2015	Breakfast in Tipton is a good way to start a caching day. I got up early and met up with dphickey, and we drove to meet Arthur in Jefferson City, where he drove us to Tipton. After the event we were joined by Unitzoid, and the 4 of us cached the area signing logs either individually or as UTAD. Thanks for all the work you put in to placing the caches! This was a little out of our way, but after the Tipton caches we didn't feel like going home right away. There were muggles, but they didn't seem to mind us. It was refreshing to see an old style log book where people could write an entry rather than just putting a signature. Near the cache we also found interesting fossils.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCTVX4_jacobs-cave-cache
dphickey	Found it	4/11/2015	OCW Arthur of Arthur and Trillian, Tony Banks and Unitzoid who joined us after the event. Are goal was to attend Old Professors Breakfast event and then clean out as much of the caches in Tipton as would could. In the end we went way south and had an adventure to remember. Find 37 of 42 for the day. After finishing in Tipton Unitzoid pointed out that we were not far from this location and the idea of finding a cache that has been in the wild as long as this one was too good to pass up. After arriving at GZ we quickly found the cache and discovered the container had water in it but the log was dry. Unitzoid did a bit of maintenance and we all practiced signing the log the old way, the water was dumped and a new baggie for the log was produced and placed back in the cache. Then some rock and fossil admiring was done. This began the best part of the day as we hit a few more even further south and each one very unique.

ArtieD	Found it	4/11/2015	OCW Tony Banks, Unitzoid and dphickey on a gorgeous day!

neco_cachero	Found it	8/5/2012	We loved this cache very much because of the area and the discovery. The best thing that we like about geocaching is how this nice hobby has showed us so many amazing places that otherwise we would have never visit. Jacob's Cave was not the exemption and on the contrary a place that we vouch to return later. We did not have much time today and by the time we found the cache the last cave tour already left port so we had to save that one for another time. We visited the rock store and had a great time talking to the owner. Amazing rocks and so many things to look around. The cache itself is awesome although you need to watch out for PI. MothraMandy spotted it for me and boy those leaves were the size of my hand palms. I had to take a long detour above and came from above to find the cache. The thorny bush was not a problem at all after I avoided the PI. Great area for a cache and fantastic cave. SL TFTC !!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCTVX4_jacobs-cave-cache

The added bonus of exploring Little Smittle cave to get the required questions only intensified my wanting to do the cache...and do some splelunking/exploring. Whenever the cave Event was published, I knew I was finally gonna be able to both explore little smittle and complete this cool multi. After exploring little smittle and following it all the way until it ends, we went to the final cache location (which I wont say where..haha)---and as a group, we all ganged up on it, tagged teamed it, and found it quickly.

FRIED OKRA	Found it	7/27/2008	I've been wanting to hit this cache for awhile now. I even drove down here to do it once, but the road into the cave was flooded that day and I was by myself so I decided against it that day. I'm glad I waited because Hot Fried Okra and I had an absolutely wonderful time teaming up to make this a team effort. Thanks Gredgeman for the idea. Gredeman and I made up some fictitious history lessons for Lady Jane while in the cave. I hope your bites don't get infected by the Smittle!!! LOL. The cave was very cool! (pun intended.) We will definately have to bring the kids back for a tour and maybe even go deeper into the cave. I'm with Dredgman - I want to go in the big cave too. It was great to meet Road Trip and his son and Lynn too!!!! I didn't have the cool head lights but used my trusty hand held flashlight. Once we were all far into the cave we all turned our lights out to experience total darkness. Awesome! Nobody got my FTF prize! (First to Fall). I would have loved to give it out. Thanks again SterlingConnie for creating this cavecache! Camdenton, Mo.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave
LadyJane1960	Found it	7/27/2008	Plan event for the day. Find out I have to work. Not changing the date. Decided to wing it. I got to the event about 5 minutes late. Introduced myself to everyone. Change clothes and have a woman hit on me in the bathroom. Can you see how the day is going? Put the parking lot coord in the Tom Tom (again what am I thinking?) Head west toward it. The others get off the highway 15 miles before me. I go in the back way. Find THE parking lot. First problem…… No one is there. Second, No fire rings to count! Third, no picnic tables! Ok, makes no sense. Grab cell…….. figures, no signal! I know they are waiting I just don’t know where. PhotoGuy says .25 miles west. Get back in the car and drive over. Yes I made an entrance and woke all the wildlife up. Get prepared to go. There are 8 of us in the party. One decided she is staying out of Ltlle Smittle as she is not prepared for it. So in we go. It’s rocky then becomes slushy then muckier than mucky then OMG is that COLD!!!!!!!! And you really can’t walk on your tip toes. Looking for boulders in a cave. (makes me wonder) But it was very primitive and untouched. I go nowhere quietly but Hot Fried Okra said she couldn’t hear me at the entrance. Winding our way back, taking pictures. But still no cache! But we have the Little Smittle part of the cache solved. And thank you to Okra & Gredgeman for the Lesson in Indian & Smittle!! Get out of the cave and start heading toward the cache. Climbing the mountain that didn’t need to be climbed we headed back down. Through the meadow where you could actually feel the humidity. Closer to the edge of the meadow you could feel the cool air from Smittle cave. There is a big steel door on it. (how it moves I don’t know) but I didn’t see it til we were right there. Saw the Happy Face on the wall. Found the cache. LOL it was interesting. Only 2 of us had GPS’ers on but all of us found the cache. Droped a coin and a bug T: nothing Thanks to Gredgeman & Tagalong Lynn for the idea of doing this cache together, Fried Okra and Hot Fried Okra for coming and also RoadTrip and his son. Was a pleasure meeting you. Hopefully our paths will cross again! LadyJane & PhotoGuy	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave
Gredgeman	Found it	7/27/2008	This is now my all time favorite cache experience! A group of 8 of us all got together after the OMG lunch by Ladyjane in Waynesville and put our adventure gear on and went for this one today. I think we got really lucky because the water levels were very low. I took alot of pictures as did everyone else. Lynn had a super wonderful time as did I and I think I can speak for the rest of the group as well. Laughing, slipping, sliding along. No bears, no snakes, no mole people, no freaky hobbit from LOR. We went much farther back than where the 2nd find objects were. We were not going to let this be just a quick park and grab experience. The water was quite cold and the natural air conditioning inside was quite an experience. No one won Fried Okra's FTF prize (First to Fall). It even got really good while approaching the final where the big cave is after you exit Little Smittle. The meadow on the approach was very hot and we were all commenting on how we would rather go back to the cave and just chill out a while. Then as you see the giant iron bars on the second cave and that natural air conditioning just seemed to kick back on with each step we took closer. I would love to go in the big cave someday. The keep out unless you want to pay a $50,000 fine makes you really think twice about wanting to sneak in though. This was truly a great experience and I can't say enough about how cool it was for you to create this cache site and bring us all here. We all made good contributions to the final cache container. I will definately be back to this site again.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave
Tollybrew	Found it	7/25/2008	I was dong a cache run in SW MO today and this was the one that took the longest but it was well worth it. It was very humid out today so the caves felt great. The first cave was very muddy but I got the info I needed, hoping I got the right answer for C. As I walked out of the cave my glasses immediately fogged up. I then headed to the final. It took me quite a while to find the final since the vegetation was overgrown. I must have walked past the cache several times before taking a closer look and landing the cache. Thanks for the great cache. It was well done and well worth my time to visit here! Tollybrew	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave

Russ, awhsom, blulady, Ri, and I arrived around 9am, and awhsom led the way into the cave where we slipped and slided our way to the stalagmites. We found that just walking in the creek was the easier, and so we took that path on the way out. It was a great hike, and a great milestone cache for awhsom - congratulations Aaron!!! We sure had a bunch of fun - thanks for an excellent cache! SL/TFTC!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave

ajayhawkfan	Found it	1/19/2008	This was my favorite cache of my trip! I was prepared for a cold wade in the cave. It was 9 degrees when I entered the cave. Steam was pouring out of the top of it. Once inside it felt quite balmy in comparison to outside. I kept my eyes open for bears hibernating. Thank heaven I did not see any. I probably should not have done this alone and in the winter but I am glad I did. The container has been chewed on. The chewing has gone through both bags. I would recommend an ammo box. Thanks for placing a great cache. I left Friday at noon to work on the new Missouri County Challenge. http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=81f5ebc4-c02c-4dd1-8999-b30d2144fc83 I had to visit 16 counties to complete it.

wavejim	Write note	9/12/2007	Found a number of lame micros on my trip to St. Robert. Decided to make a beeline here before it got dark. Found all the clues but did not look at the hint until we left. Did not find the cache all though probably would have if I had looked at the clue. Had a great time finding the clues. This was quite the welcome to Missouri!!! My 16 year old son fell in the slick mud twice, me 0. Took the rest of the crew, my younger kids, to the final coords and had a blast. They must have spent 30 minutes looking in the water for frogs, crawdads, etc. It was a memorable adventure. TFTH	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave

Lacomo	Found it	7/31/2007	Webscouter and I teamed up to find this one today. What a great experience it was. Beauty is only skin deep does not apply when it comes to the Ozarks. This cave is proof of that. Some really breathtaking formations inside this cave. It's worth all the mud and water you have to wade through to get the last clue. We didn't stop there because we wanted to see some more of the cave so we went on back quite a ways. I don't know why more people don't do this cache. It's really not that hard to do. No crawling at all it's all upright walking, that is unless you land on your butt in the slick mud. We found the cache pretty quick after getting to GZ. Like Webscouter mentioned it neads a new container. Thanks for the best cache I've went after so far. I really enjoyed it all from begining to end.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave
webscouter.	Found it	7/31/2007	What a great way to spend an afternoon. I brought lots of light sticks to hang at intersections so we wouldn't get lost in the cave. Never did use them. This is a great cave to explore, lots of neat formations, mud to slip and slide in, water to keep your hands clean and nooks and crannies to check out. We didn't see any bats but we sure looked hard for some. We found that the best way to keep from sliding around was to walk in the water instead of trying to keep up on the mud banks. It didn't seem like we had walked very far when we got to the second clue so we continued on into the cave. The water flows a lot faster than it would seem and there was a fog in the cave that made it a little harder to take a really good picture. But we tried. I saw one small salamander in the creek but the mud I was stirring up quickly obscured it from view. After finding the clues we headed back out the cave and decided to walk to the final and let our pants dry out a bit before getting back in the car. This cache is one of the reasons that I really like to cache, I mean why else would a 40 something year old clamor around in a cave in the middle of the week. Sure makes me feel like an adventurer. The final container has been chewed up a bit but amazingly the log book was dry. Thanks for a great adventure.

Lone Wolf Seeker	Found it	9/24/2006	This was such an awesome cache. This was our first day for couple caching and this one made it very memorable, even when I slipped in the cave and got all muddy.

2NUBees	Found it	9/24/2006	I have been looking forward to doing this cache ever since it came out and today was finally the day I got to go. We met some friends of ours at the TA truck stop in Strafford to fuel up on some breakfast and we then headed off to do some caches. We got the the parking area and headed off into the cave to get the info we needed to do the final leg of this cache. It was a challenge for me, as this was my very first time exploring a cave other than the ride through one. LOL. I had decided that even if we didn't find the final cache the real treasure was going into the cave. I made it out without falling in the mud but one of our party wasn't so lucky...we about fell over laughing so hard. On our way out we saw two bats which were awesome! We got a lot of pictures and a lot of muddy feet but I'm here to tell you, if you want to know what caching is all about, try this cache. It has to be at the top of my BEST CACHE of all times list. We made it to the final leg of the cache and just as we arrived the Muggle family showed up. We did a bit of minimal searching until they left and then we really did some hard searching. I had to read the clue and after a bit longer we were able to find the cache. THANKS SO MUCH SterlingConnie for the BEST adventure in my caching history. If you go prepared to get dirty and wet this is an adventure of a lifetime. T-Coleman Keychain and L-geocaching pencil and Smokey Bear button. Thanks again for an AWSOME CACHE!!!!!!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave
Jhwk	Found it	9/9/2006	Got the chance to go for this cache today while in the area for a horse show. I have to say that I have a new top ten cache. Met with a troop of Boy Scouts from Marshfield, MO, while gathering clues for the final cache. They were having a blast in all of the mud. Cave was cool on such a warm day. Unfortunately, my math skills appear to be challenged, but through brute force and a keen sense of caches, I finally spotted the hide. It's in great shape, but I didn't have anything small enough to tuck in, so TNLNSL. Thanks for a great cache and for memories that will last a lifetime.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave

Sola Fide	Found it	8/12/2006	My Dad (Specter) and I sent the day out caching together. I really needed a day away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. We had a blast going through the caves. View the picture I attached and you will see how muddy you will end up if you decide to sit down while in the cave. Both caves that you are able to explore require that you get a little dirty so bring extra shoes and a change of clothes. As for the caves themselves they are two of the best caves that I have gone through without paying an arm and a leg to go through. Thank you and good job for placing this cache here.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave

Specter	Found it	8/5/2006	FTF. I have been watching this Cache sense it came out and was really surprised that we were the FTF. I ask my son Sola Fide to come with me and I’m really glad I shared this with him we had a very great time. This is really a super area to have a cache there are two very awesome caves to explore and I might add there is MUD lots of MUD in little smittle cave so go prepared. We explored both caves all the way to the back or as far as we could go without getting on our hands and knees or climbing. It’s well worth the trip just to see the area and caves. We searched for about 45 mins before I stumble on to it, I think the rocks and cliff walls was really messing up our GPSr and we just was not getting real good readings. Thanks SterlingConnie for placing this really great cache that we would never have know about if it wasn’t for Geocaching it’s one of the best I have done. I took the honor of being the FTF and my son the co finder took the $5 I left a LED Coleman lantern to use when someone else goes to explore nearby Lowell Cave.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXDZF_smittle-cave

While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time I don?t think we can do so any longer. Therefore, I have archived this cache. If you haven?t done so already, please pick up any remaining cache bits as soon as possible. When repairs to this cache are completed and it is time to have it reposted, it will be no problem. Just drop me a note http://www.geocaching.com/email/?guid=60a6e93a-ef95-469f-ae54-045eef7aa929 and let me know the GC waypoint number of the cache or better yet, the URL of the cache page. You will still be able to access your cache page just as before by going to your ?My Cache Page? and clicking the link of your cache. I will be more than happy to take a look at your cache again to see if it is still is within the guidelines of the Geocaching.com website for cache placement and posting. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future. Thanks for your understanding, Reviewer of the Cache - Geocaching.com Volunteer Cache Reviewer	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave

*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	9/29/2008	NEEDS REPAIR [red] DISABLING CACHE: [/red] Greetings, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last log on this cache, it appears that this cache is in need of repair since the cache is totally missing. It was replaced last time by another cacher from the area. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. Hope things get fixed up soon. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. [b]If I do not hear from you about fixing up this cache, I will assume that it is abandoned and archive the cache. We need to work to maintain the good relationships we have with the parks in the area. We cannot afford to let our caches turn into litter.

Hobbit Taz	Found it	1/6/2008	Took a bit of searching since our GPSr was pointing us about 20 feet away in what seemed like a good spot. Found a small round object but when I poked at it found it was a dried puff ball mushroom ready to explode (glad I didnt poke any harder). Today, was too nice of a day (70's in Jan. after below freezing a few days ago). CribbageWitch had a new bike she was wanting to give a breakin on so thought this would be the park for it. Got a late start since I found my bike was in worse condition than I thought so ended up getting a new bike also before heading down to the park. We made it a 9 for 9 with all the caches on the lower end trail loop (that is until LFrank placed a whole series of them here today which we found out after getting home. - guess it will be another trip - Actually looking forward to it. Thanks for bringing us here).	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave
CribbageWitch	Found it	1/6/2008	Santa (Hobbit Taz) got me a new bicycle for Yule and this was the first day that the weather cooperated so I could get some riding in.

carpendrum	Found it	11/24/2007	We decided to try geocaching while visiting family in the area for the holiday weekend. Ran into County Park volunteers John and Bonnie who had a lot of good things to say about the troop who had worked so hard to clean up this part of the trail. They hadn’t realized there was a cache there, but they were a big help. We left a hiking stick tag from our state park back in Texas. TFTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave
Tollybrew	Found it	11/18/2007	This was my second cache of the day while driving toward 2000 finds. I rode my bike to this one down the dirt trail along the Ol' Miss.

I was out with Inuiva and Eagleye93 today, and as was the theme Eagleye93 zeroed right in on this cache. Thanks to the troop for putting this out here!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave
Mean Gene	Found it	9/3/2007	The Rooter wanted to go bike riding so we headed over to do this one. This was unavailable last time we were here. The parking lot was well over half full and there were thirty or forty folks out on the pave trail. However, we had the dirt trail leading to the cache all to ourselves. We could tell that this place floods periodically but things were dry today. The Rooter found the cache is a totally logical spot. Took nothing and left nothing.

myotis	Found it	6/10/2007	Biked and hiked in Cliff Cave park. Had a really good time and many nice caches. Thanks for all the nice caches. I really liked the dirt trail. Could not belive you cannot see the Mississippi from the Mississippi River Trail. It was nice to see the river instead of the a corn field. I did the trail on my bike. I have a hybrid and had to walk it in a few short places. Overall the trail was in good shape. Wear long pants! I would not do it on a street bike. This one took the longest of all 12 I did today.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave
L Frank	Found it	5/28/2007	The river is back down below the trail, but it left behind a lot of driftwood and gumbo mud. You can walk it, but bikes won't be able to get by the wood until someone with a chainsaw clears it away. T Diabetes TB, L quarter. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave
Gerhardus	Found it	4/19/2007	This morning I hit the pavement at 7:55 and by 8:30 had the cache in hand. Thanks for the replacement on this one. I had struck out finding it once before. Round trip to cache is about 3 miles. Oh yeah the river is within a few feet of the trail at one point. A foot to a 18 inches rise in the river and the trail is covered. The cache will be ok though.

pandyandy	Found it	4/8/2007	Thanks to cds231 and javapgmr for fixing this cache up the day before I am going out there. I helped out a little and added about 5 things to be used for trade for the next finders. I like the way that the caches near the river are up off the ground so they won’t go down stream when the river comes up. Makes sense to me.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave

javapgmr	Found it	4/7/2007	OCW CDS231 on this cold, blustery Saturday in April. We cached the whole lower Cliff Cave area today and walked the whole loop and found all the caches. CDS231 brought a replacement container along and we were able to get this one back up and functioning again. The container isn't the same but at least there's a cache to find and a log to sign. TNLNSL. TFTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave
CDS231	Found it	4/7/2007	Out caching with javapgmr today and we knew we were going to be doing this area. Brought along a small container to replace the evidently lost one so the cache will continue. You are now looking for a small Lock and Lock, square container that is hidden at the original coodinates.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave

Go to your cache page and e-mail *gln from the log there OR email me at Glenn.GeocachingAdmin@gmail.com , referencing the cache URL's, or waypoint numbers. [/green][/b] Good Evening, So sorry to pop in here like this but I have had many complaints about lots of caches that haven't been checked on lately so I have been reading logs and checking up on the caches with several "No Finds" in the last month or so. I haven't seen any replies from you regarding the no finds on your Troop 61 Cliff Cave cache and I am starting to get a sense that this one should be checked on. Sadly, for now, this cache is disabled (which you can enable at any time of course). That should get 'ya few more weeks to check on this before this cache is archived. From the gc.com listing guidelines.. "As the cache owner, you are also responsible for checking on your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – [red] normally a few weeks[/red], in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing.

We walked right by this one but didn't bother to stop and take the time to look for it, since there were three previous NO FINDS and the cache owner didn't respond to my email earlier in the week. Mean Gene was convinced that he'd seen that this one was archived, but I see now that it isn't.

pa	Found it	11/1/2006	The coords were good but it still took a little searching to find the cache. Nice area. Thanks. PA	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave
JanS03	Found it	10/30/2006	Very windy walking the trail today. Other than the wind everything was nice and quiet along the river--no boats or barges in sight anywhere. GPS gave me a bit of a tour of the area before I was able to find the cache. Thanks SPL61. JanS03	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCYZRT_troop-cliff-cave
Strider	Write note	10/30/2006	Hi guys, I was one of the group of 4 cachers with the black & white dog that you passed on your bikes yesterday while heading to your cache. If we'd known what you were up to it would've been the quickest FTF (First to Find) ever. Now we're gonna have to walk back out there again We'll get to it ASAP, but not today, we did the whole loop there, plus several other long cache hikes for over 11 miles of walking. Good luck with your cache, and good luck finding many more. If you ever need any assistance, just drop me or anyone else a note, we are always glad to help.

*gln	Enable Listing	10/30/2006	Looks Good. Congratulations SPL61 . Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site. As a cache placer,* you * have the unique ability to improve (or degrade) the quality of Geocaching in your area. I hope that this cache will be a positive addition. One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one guy here with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . Looks fun, Enjoy! Cheers & Thanks for your contributions to Geocaching, Glenn, your friendly Geocaching.com admin.

Wsmittytoo	Didn't find it	8/18/2001	Tried once more with a crew this time. Rope came in handy since I took my son. What a cliff. I got some good pics and another great adventure. One of the crew had found this one before and we wanted him to verify if this one still existed. Sorry to say it is gone. Too bad. Looking forward to Cave Demons #2. Thanks for the good time.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC677_cave-demons
Todd & Tracy	Didn't find it	8/18/2001	Went with Wsmith and Steve to confirm it's existance, it is gone!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC677_cave-demons
Steve Brown	Didn't find it	8/18/2001	We tried again and discovered that the cache has disappeared. We took Todd with us today. Todd found the cache last spring and verified that it is missing. It has been two great adventures but no cache. I really hate that because I am out of caches to go hunt. This is kind of a dangerous place, so maybe it is best that it has disappeared.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC677_cave-demons
Wsmittytoo	Didn't find it	8/11/2001	This is mine and Brenda's second try at this one. Decided to get with Steve Brown to attempt this one with us this time. We scaled every inch of the cliff and had quite an adventure however still no find. We checked the cave on top of the cave where we thought it should be and no luck. Spread out about 200' in each direction high and low. Nearly lost one of the group when a dead tree was used for leverage. It sure would help to know if this one was still here. Also a couple more clues and a coordinate check would be nice. Heed the advice of the others and DO NOT BRING THE KIDS! Brought rope and it definiately came in handy. The owner surely could help us out here! Will not attempt again without more clues. Thanks. Great adventure anyway.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC677_cave-demons

PuppyChaos	Found it	6/9/2001	Our best advice on this one is be prepared and don't bring the kids. Don't know if there was an easy way which was overgrown or rock slides from the recent rains made this one tougher, but it was a challenge. You might want to bring a rope. This is probably not a good first cache, but we had fun. We met some new geocachers who had read the KC Star article. They had a trophy they were going to try to put in a more family friendly cache. Let us know if you see it. Left a Tom Clancy submarine computer game, bandaids and an Autralian coin(our signature items). Took nothing.

Turken&Hatzs	Write note	5/25/2001	This was our second try looking, but still no find. I think that either everything is too grown over, or the cache has been removed. The only thing I didn't do was actually enter the cave. Not only do I prefer to follow no trespassing signs, I don't feel safe in such caves. We did look from the entrance and didn't see anything that looked like a cache. Maybe we'll try again this fall/winter after things die down.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC677_cave-demons
HiRez_L	Found it	4/25/2001	Another one I forgot to log, have to use my brothers' description . . . April 25, 2001 by rynokc (41 found) Finally, this is my second try at locating this cache. I took Rhonda the first time and she wasn't thrilled about the climb or the entrance. So she stayed grounded this time and Rusty went with me. The cache is in good shape, but the lid doesn't fit the container, so the next person may want to take another container and lid out if you have an extra. The traditional 8 x 11 tupperware would work nicely. Very good place to hide one. We found a painter on the overpass painting some of the skyline, he was pretty good. Took Stone Die and left Taz Pez Dispensor that came from another cache sight. Score: Ryan 5, Rhonda 5 (kinda), and Rusty 6	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC677_cave-demons

smcginnis	Found it	4/14/2001	From Fort Scott, Kansas. This was a fun and interesting one. After looking all around where I thought it should be,(for what seemed like forever). I noticed where it probably was. Then got to where I could see it, but couldn't get too it. Great cache spot. Right in plain site (if your in the right spot). Thanks for a great outing. Took the purple necklace, and left a stone die, (one half of a pair of dice). Thanks again, Steve	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC677_cave-demons
Todd & Tracy	Found it	4/13/2001	Tough, but fun to find. Definitely a challenge and a neat location. It took us a little while to find, as the location could be approached from many different directions. At one point, we probably would have seen it if we looked, but getting there would have proven tough, so we went around and approached it from a different angle. I kinda left Tracy on the cliff. Definitely the hardest one yet, not for one afraid of an adventure! We were the first to find it so the cache was in fine shape. Took a toy dragon and left a pen and a smiley face bracelet. I wish we had brought a flashlight to check out some of the crevices!. (Score Todd 6, Tracy 6)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC677_cave-demons
Tocamare	Found it	4/12/2001	Actually saw it but didn't take, leave, or write anything...Had my 7 year old nephew and didn't think this was the place for a family picnic so to speak. Definitely for the older, chance taking, adult crowd.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC677_cave-demons
