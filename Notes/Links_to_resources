Whole course on Networking Epi projects:
https://statnet.github.io/nme/index.html
Incudes lots of information on visualization of networks and simplifies the math extrememly

logistic regression and accounting for differences in exposure by BB:
https://rpubs.com/bbolker/logregexp
Includes description of how it all works + neat bird example

Interpreting estimates of cloglog
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132627/interpreting-estimates-of-cloglog-logistic-regression
BB explains the results of our functions

ABC vs MCMC
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/214724/how-do-abc-and-mcmc-differ-in-their-applications
Explanation of which is appropriate for us (probably MCMC)

Hazard rate explanation
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/148699/modelling-a-binary-outcome-when-census-interval-varies
probably not relevant to us but good to learn

Link rate explanation
http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dbandyop/pubh8472/Link_Binomial.pdf
Explains the binomial link function 

Complementary Log Log Model
http://www.stat.ualberta.ca/~kcarrier/STAT562/comp_log_log.pdf
very cool cloglog explanation/modeling example and includes logit = probit proof

Poisson to Bernouilli cloglog proof
https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/tag/cloglog
Using the cloglog to see if poisson model is good or not and is actually really cool proof

Gompertz Function
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function
Gompertz is so close to cloglog (Need to learn moreabout link functions)

Modeling discrete survival time
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4360712/
Statsy paper with bernoulli cloglog proof

Intro to SIR binomial (Reed Frost)
http://courses.washington.edu/b578a/readings/bookchap4.pdf
Introduction to Reed-Frost model and discussion of neighboring infections. I dont think it would work because of closed population.
A critical assumption of the model. 

Greenwood Model
https://www.tribonet.org/wiki/greenwoods-contact-model/
description of Greenwood model. I'm unsure if this is applicable or what is even happening through out.
