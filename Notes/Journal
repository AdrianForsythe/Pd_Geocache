- Started to create files in github to try and work out of the repo more
- Nature paper that says Coronavirus is linked to white nose so I can explain to my friends what I do

UPDATE: Different coronavirus but still pretty cool paper
- Decided that for first few simulations only 10 will suffice
- Need to still confirm with Adrian size of validation set after it has been full scraped
