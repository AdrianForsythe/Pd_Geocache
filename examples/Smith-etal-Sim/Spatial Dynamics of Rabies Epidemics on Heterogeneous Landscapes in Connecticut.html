As an epidemic spreads, the front is often jagged and irregular, reflecting
spatial variation in local transmission rates, stochasticity, or reporting
errors. We developed a methodology for quantifying spatial variation in the
rates of disease spread across a heterogeneous landscape. The results have been
discussed in detail in our paper, "Predicting the Spatial Dynamics of Rabies
Epidemics on Heterogenous Landscapes," <b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/http://www.pnas.org/">
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </a> </b> by David Smith,
Brendan Lucey, Lance Waller, James E. Childs, and Leslie A. Real. (To download

HERE.</a>) Here, we have provided supplementary information about the methods,
raw data and computer code, and instructional information. 

<h2> <a name="connecticut">  Step One: Date of First Appearance</a> </h2> 

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/connecticut.html"> <img src="./Spatial Dynamics of Rabies Epidemics on Heterogeneous Landscapes in Connecticut_files/connecticut.jpg" height="181" width="300" align="right"></a> 

<b> Racoon Rabies in Connecticut:</b> Racoon rabies first appeared in
Connecticut in 1990 as part of a large epidemic in the northeastern US
beginning in 1977 near the border between Virginia and West Virginia. In
Connecticut, dead or suspicious raccoons were reported to local health
officials. The animals were collected or captured and sent to state health
offices to test for the presence of rabies. In Connecticut, the location of
rabid raccoons was recorded township by township. Thus, the data reflect
passsive reporting for political units, not ecological relevant units. To
download the raw data for the date of first appearance, or to see an enlarged
view of the figure, click on the image to the right.  

<p> We wanted to develop predictive models for the invasive spread of rabies
across heterogeneous landscapes. To do this, we developed models to predict the
date when rabies was first detected in each of the Connecticut's 169 townships.

</p><h2> <a name="network"> Step Two: The Adjacency Network </a>  </h2> 

<b> Defining a Network: </b> Since the data were aggregated
township by township, we developed a mathematical model for the
spatial spread of rabies on a network defined by the townships
and their adjacency relationships. We generated a file using a
GIS database  of Connecticut townships (illustrated at the right)
to define the relationships. Two townships were defined to be to
be adjacent if they shared more than one point in common along
the border. In the illustration at the left, the vertices of the
graphs are placed at the geographical centers of each of the 169
townships.  An edge connects each pair of townships that shares a
border.  To see an enlarged version of the image at the left or
download the adjacency matrix, click the figure to the left.

<h2> Step Three: Surrogate Variables</h2> We wanted to use data
that was readily availabe that we could use as a surrogates for
the variables associated with raccoon movement population
density. The population density of wildlife is not readily
available, and expensive to obtain for an area as large as
Connecticut. We chose one variable that was associated with
raccoon movement, and one associated with raccoon density. The
two variables were human population density and the position of
large rivers. To download the raw data, click on the image at the
left. 

<p> <b> Human Population Density </b> We used data from the 1990
census for human population density for the townships.  

</p><p> <b> Rivers: </b> Based on a GIS database, we also determined
whether the centers of two townships were separated by a river or
other large body of water.  In the illustration of the network,
the blue edges represent townships that are separated by water.
The red edges represent two townships that are adjacent, but not
totally separated by a large body of water. 

</p><p> <b> Translocation: </b> In the model, rabid raccoons may be
transported long distances aided (deliberately or not) by human
movement. In addition, long-distance migration of young raccoons
may transmit raccoon rabies to a township in advance of the
front.  We sought to quantify the rate that such events occur.  


</p><h2> <a name="model"> Step Four: A Stochastic Model </a> </h2> 

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/model.html"> <img src="./Spatial Dynamics of Rabies Epidemics on Heterogeneous Landscapes in Connecticut_files/model.gif" align="right"></a>

We developed a discrete-event simulator; or in other words, a
simulator in continuous time for which the infection of each
townships occurs at a unique point in time. Each time one
township becomes infected, the probability of infection in nearby
townships increases.  The algorithm determines which township is
infected, and when it becomes infected. The algorithm has six
steps. 

<ol>
<li> For each township, sum the infection rates to compute the <b>Township Rate.</b> 
	<ul>
	<li> A township may become infected through local transmission if adjacent
	townships are infected. Local transmission rates may be higher
	or lower depending on the population density of the neighbor and whether or not
	two townships are separated by a river.  
	</li><li> A township may become infected through long-distance translocation of
	rabid raccoons. 
	</li><li> For each township, the total rate is the sum of the local rate divided
	by the number of neighbors plus the long-distance translocation rate.   
   </li></ul>
</li><li> Compute the <b>Total Rate</b> of change, the sum of all the <b>Township Rates
</b>.
</li><li> Compute the elapsed time, the waiting time to the next event. The waiting 
time is exponentially distributed with expected time 1/<b>Total Rate</b>. In the
simulator, we draw a random variate from this distrubution. 
</li><li> In the simulator, we "force" the edges on the western border of
Connecticut. The time to infection is not simulated, but given by the data.
After computing the elapsed time, we see whether the date when rabies was
observed in one of the forced townships preceded the simulated event. If so,
the borders are forced, and no event is simulated.
</li><li> If no event is forced, we simulate infection. Only one township becomes
infected at a time, so the algorith simply selects one. The probability for any
particular township is its <b>Township Rate / Total Rate</b>. We draw a
multinomial random variate to determine which township is infected. 
</li><li> Finally, once a township has been infected, we update the infection status
and repeate the algorithm until every township is infected. 
</li></ol>

<h2> Step Five: Candidate Models </h2> 

Each candidate model is determined by a rule for determining local rates of
spread, and the rate of translocation. The five candidate models we tested were
<ul>
<li> <b> Null:</b> A simple model with no heterogeneity in the rate of spread. 
</li><li> <b> Human: </b> The local rate of spread was correlated with the natural
log of the population density of the infected neighbor.
</li><li> <b> River:</b>  A river with uniform rates of translocation, but different
local rates crossing rivers.
</li><li> <b> RivHum1: </b> A combination of <b> River </b> and <b> Human </b> with
different slopes and intercepts for local spread crossing, and not crossing
rivers.
</li><li> <b> RivHum2: </b> An extension of <b> River </b>, but the rate of
long-distance translocation was correlated with the log of human population
density.  
</li></ul>

<h2> <a name="results"> Step Six: Fitting the models </a> </h2>  

For each model, and a set of parameters, the <b> Expected </b> behavior of the
model was determined by simulating the model 5,000 times, and taking the
average time to first appearance over the ensemble. 

<p> For each candidate model, we searched parameter space to find the
parameters that minimized the Pearson Chi-Squared statistic, the sum over all
townships of <b> (Observed - Expected)^2 / Expected </b> for all the townships
(ignoring those that were forced). Click <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/model.html"> here </a> for
additional technical details and the computer code. 

</p><h2> <a name="chisq"> Step Seven: Model Selection and Goodness of Fit </a> </h2>  

Ranking the Chi-Squared statistics for the best fit parameters for all five
candidate models is one way to compare the relative goodness of fit. For
example, <b> Rivers </b> had a goodness of fit measure that was 10% lower than
the <b> Null </b> Model. The fit was done separately with and without Putnam, a
clear outlier. 

In addition, we used the Chi-square distribution to estimate the overall
goodness of fit.  A histogram of the residuals shows that they are
approximately normally distributed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/chisq.html">see histograms
</a>).  Moreover, the elements of the are consistent with the assumptions of a
Chi-Square distribution with one degree of freedon. Three townships, South
Windsor ``sw,'' Union ``u,'' and Enfield ``e,'' contribute disproportionately
to the variance; without these three points the mean would be 0.98 and the
variance would be 1.74, consistent with the assumptions.  Since the assumptions
are consistent with the Chi-square distribution with one-degree of freedom, we
used the summed Chi-square statistic with the appropriate degrees of freedom to
generate p-values to test for the goodness of fit.

<p> A good statistical fit required the addition of habitat heterogeneity.  The
goodness of fit measure improved by approximately 10% in the models that
included rivers compared with those did not (see Table, above); this margin is much
larger than the 1% improvement in the goodness of fit measure gained by
incorporating human population density. The relatively large improvement
suggests that rivers play an important role in rabies transmission.  Moreover,
when Putnam was excluded (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/rabies.html#quantitative"> Figure c, bottom graph</a>
), models that did not incorporate rivers were rejected by the goodness of fit
test, while those that did incorporate rivers were not.  A comparison of the
significance values, parameter values, and improvement in the goodness of fit
from the addition of rivers suggests that a predictive model requires a
seven-fold reduction in transmission crossing rivers (fitted parameters are
reported in the table).

</p><h2> Step Seven: Quantitative Interpretation </h2>

In the models that generated the best fit (see the Table), slower local spread
of rabies was strongly associated with river crossings, the global spread by
translocation was relatively frequent, and human population density had very
little effect on the local spread of rabies.  All of the models that
incorporated slowing at rivers had a better fit than the alternative models
that did not include this factor (Table 1).  Using the full data set, all of
the models differed significantly from the observed data. The model predictions
and observations were substantially different in a few townships (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/chisq.html"> histogram</a>  and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/rabies.html#quantitative">  panel c, bottom
graph </a> ).

<p>Even though local transmission accounted for most transmission,
long-distance translocation was frequent. Of the 159 townships not on the
western border of Connecticut, twenty-one townships (13%) recorded their first
case of raccoon rabies when none of the adjacent townships were infected. 

</p><p> Human population density was weakly associated with the rate of local
spread and the rate of translocation (the difference in the rate of spread
between the least and most populated township was 11% in <b> RivHum2</b>  and
14% in <b> RivHum1 </b> ). The fits did improve when human population density
was used to predict the rate of spread, but the improvements were minor and the
improved fit may be artifactual. Any association between the rate of spread and
human population density is consistent with a hypothesis of increased rate of
rabies spread into the townships, but it also supports a hypothesis of more
efficient detection. 

</p><p> Most important, we found that river crossings slowed the spread of rabies
by a factor of seven. The earliest appearance of rabies east of the Connecticut
river may have been due to a rare translocation event rather than a more
predictable local transmission event; the first case of rabies east of the
Connecticut river was detected in South Windsor (``sw'' in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/connecticut.html"> top graph </a> , <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/rabies.html#quantitative">panel b,
bottom graph</a>), far in advance of the front, and the first cases in nearby
townships of Enfield and Union and one adjacent township were observed shortly
thereafter (``e'' and ``u'' in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/connecticut.html"> top graph </a> ,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/rabies.html#quantitative">panel b, bottom graph</a>). Similar but less
dramatic patterns are observed in the townships surrounding Clinton in the
southern, central townships (``c'' in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/connecticut.html"> top graph
</a> , <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127190904/medschool.umaryland.edu/departments/epidemiology/dsmith/rabies.html#quantitative">panel b, bottom graph</a>).

</p><p> To assess the consequences of a seven-fold delay crossing rivers on the
overall dynamics of rabies, we further simulated the epidemic with and without
rivers and with and without long-distance translocation. Rivers delay the
appearance in southeastern Connecticut by approximately 16 months (Figure d,
below) without translocation and by 11 months with translocation. The effect of
rivers was strongest close to the river and declined with the distance from the
river. A river shadow effect was visible (Figure d, below). We attribute this
shadow effect to two properties of these models. First, a small probability of
translocation adds stochasticity that obscures the patterns that would be
formed by local heterogeneity. Local delays associated with river crossings are
reduced if rabid raccoons cross rivers by translocation. Second, patterns
caused by local heterogeneity dissipate because there are multiple routes for
the spread of infection. For example, once an epidemic reaches a river, it may
cross at any of the shared boundaries. After the epidemic crosses the river, it
may spread rapidly down the river to other townships.  Consequently, a long
local delay crossing the river may appear shorter because it is most strongly
affected by the average first event, not the average of all events.
