After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return. Think I have the anwers and will e-mail them shortly. I really enjoyed this EC and wish I was around when it was visited by the stars of the Grand Ol' Opry.

After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return.

After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return. Think I have the anwers and will e-mail them shortly. I really enjoyed this EC and wish I was around when it was visited by the stars of the Grand Ol' Opry.

After walking to GZ and taking a less than flattering picture, I headed to the Visitors Center. Arrived at about 0820 and even though the sign said their hours started at 0800, the door was locked. After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return. Think I have the anwers and will e-mail them shortly. I really enjoyed this EC and wish I was around when it was visited by the stars of the Grand Ol' Opry.

After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return.

After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return. Think I have the anwers and will e-mail them shortly. I really enjoyed this EC and wish I was around when it was visited by the stars of the Grand Ol' Opry. Thanks for bringing me to this spot, the lesson and TFTC."

After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return.

After walking to GZ and taking a less than flattering picture, I headed to the Visitors Center. Arrived at about 0820 and even though the sign said their hours started at 0800, the door was locked. After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return. Think I have the anwers and will e-mail them shortly. I really enjoyed this EC and wish I was around when it was visited by the stars of the Grand Ol' Opry.

After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return.

After walking to GZ and taking a less than flattering picture, I headed to the Visitors Center. Arrived at about 0820 and even though the sign said their hours started at 0800, the door was locked. After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return. Think I have the anwers and will e-mail them shortly. I really enjoyed this EC and wish I was around when it was visited by the stars of the Grand Ol' Opry.

After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return.

We encountered numerous muggles walking 4-foots, lots of ducks, a goose, fish, and a chipmonk. What impressed me the most was just how cold that air was coming from the mouth of the cave.

It seems that Old Man Winter has gone forever...boohoo) here in the East Tennessee hills. My thanks again to all the local fellow geocachers who hide these little guys for the rest of us to find!"

We also made a visit to the Smoky Mountain Knife Works and the Aquarium. Quick one for us. Our MiGO Geocoin (our cache odometer) made the visit with us. We signed the log and took nor left anything.

Last year, Doug_hollyNKC happened to mention how much he liked this cache when he heard I was going to be in the area. I never made it over to the cache last year...and I am happy for that. This year, we traveled down for vacation with me sitting at 3,997 caches. I needed something for my 4,000th cache. I had my options narrowed down to only a few caches. This was one of them. It was a cache I probably would not have looked at if Doug had not mentioned it as we usually do not get over to Branson during the week we are here. Well, the other two options had a slight problem. One requires SCUBA diving and while my wife is certified, I am not, and we did not have all of the necessary gear and did not want to rent it all for a single cache. The other would have required considerably more drive time even though it is closer to where we are staying due to the need to approach from the opposite side of the lake. That left Soldier's Cave, one Doug spoke highly of and had me intrigued. My wife and I both like hiking, so a choice was made. I still needed two more caches. I intended to get them in the park but a wrong turn trying to find the parking area and I ended up getting the nearby virtual for #3998. Once parked, we went through the construction (so nice that they made a path for hikers to do this) and I signed Tipped Over! for #3999 (can't believe I overlooked it but my wife made the find). I passed a few others to get to Soldier's Cave. I had to use my phone to do this. My Oregon is in Nebraska having left it with a friend last week by accident. My eTrex was not working due to dead batteries. This meant that signal was not great along parts of the trail. The hike down the rocks was pretty cool. I was quite impressed by how it had the impression of being positioned more ornately, with winding, curving stairways. We saw a few lizards along the way too. Once done with the stairs, the waterfall area was nice. We saw a picture of what it looks like when it is flowing and that would have been fun to see. The trail was not as easy to follow there but we found the spot and climbed the rocks to continue. Eventually, we found a large cave. It seemed like a good spot but my phone said I was still 120 feet away. My wife stayed behind as I went forward. The phone was not changing and it got further away. I turned back and once at the cave entrance, I joined her in the search. After a few minutes, I happened to get at the right angle, well the right angle to see the cache but not for comfort. I signed the log and then my wife took some photos. After signing, we explored the cave. A pretty neat cave. It seems roomy for a single person, but it would have been cold in the winter. I took some pictures inside the cave as well before we took some more outside. Then we began the hike back. We both were a bit tired from the stairs but we also both enjoyed the hike. Thank you for placing this one here. I will add a favorite point, not just because this is officially my 4,000th find, but because we both had a lot of fun. And a thanks to Doug for recommending this one too me."

We really wanted to get to this cache as I saw it after it was first published and the logs looked intriguing. On our last several trips to Branson we just couldn't get the hike into our schedule with family groups, ice storms, etc. So today was the day, we thought. Unfortunately we have to post a DNF like the last log. Found everything as described and even gave the cave a good search to see if it had been ""misplaced"", but came up empty. Glad we could carry on and get a find on the exciting ""Panther's View"" down the trail."

Day Two - in and around Branson: Out caching with Don't Call Me Sir, KevinP_JF, Lakeshore Cacher, thetruth7, tx Packrat and Mrs. tx Packrat. After the Flash Mob we set out to find this one. It was truly a destination cache for this trip. KevnP_JF, thetruth7, Ms tx Packrat and Don't Call Me Sir served together in Korea and it is only fitting that they find Soldier Cave together. So, the hike began. Down, down, down the steps we went. (That is a LOT of steps!) The trail to the cache site was wet and a bit slick but a slow steady pace made it a go for everyone involved. (8 adults and 3 kids in all.) The cache itself was pretty easy to find. The real ""treasure"" for us was the experience. As was said among our group several times - it was ""epic"". The soldiers took a pic in the cave and explored a bit. We all took in the scenery and the beautiful view of the river. We headed on down the trail to grab another cache and then it was back UP. We stopped at the waterfall and some of the group played around a bit. Then we began the climb back up ALL those steps. I know we will all feel this in the morning (or soon thereafter) but it was totally worth it. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work.

Off we went such a nice walk through the woods then the stairs came, and came, and came. We arrived at the bottom only to find much more trail to go. Arriving at the cave site I was in the lead so Kevin and Tiffany had to come find me. It is hard to imagine living in this cave for so long its a long way anywhere and im sure his trail was no where near as nice as our walk in.

So, we drove our daughter to her friend's hotel and decided to go after this cache in the two hours that we had to kill. I was a little worried about just how difficult it might be do to in the dark, with the rain from today making the steps slick, and the wet leaves adding to the slippery-ness, but my husband said we should go for it anyway. :) So, off we went. He didn't use a light at all, but I constantly burned my flashlight app on my phone along the way, so I would have any falls. We LOVED this cache. Thanks for bringing us here! He enjoyed the cave and talked about the books he read when he was younger. My friend Tallulahtulip told me about this cache over a year ago and said we should go for it, so glad that we did! We tried to take some pictures, but they didn't come out that great. We stayed here for a while, listening to the sounds of bats over the river, then made our ascent where we DNF'd a cache that we probably shouldn't have. We didn't have a lot of time to keep looking, so we had to give up on that one. Thanks for the memories! This entry was edited by go-purdue on Sunday, 28 October 2012 at 16:17:25 UTC."

What we didn't factor in was the humidity and the overlooked fact that we had to park our 14 month old son's stroller at the stairs and hike all 730 odd stairs with him in our arms or on our shoulders. Didn't bring the kiddo backpack to have him ride in! All in all it was a great little hike. Made it down and back in about 30 minutes to ensure we met up with my parents for more Branson sightseeing. Took some time to explore the cave and take some pictures. Thanks for a great natural adventure in the land of lights and corny shows!

The cache , of course. Signed log, TFTC. This entry was edited by ClaraJean on Monday, 16 September 2013 at 00:10:44 UTC.

Last year, Doug_hollyNKC happened to mention how much he liked this cache when he heard I was going to be in the area. I never made it over to the cache last year...and I am happy for that. This year, we traveled down for vacation with me sitting at 3,997 caches. I needed something for my 4,000th cache. I had my options narrowed down to only a few caches. This was one of them. It was a cache I probably would not have looked at if Doug had not mentioned it as we usually do not get over to Branson during the week we are here. Well, the other two options had a slight problem. One requires SCUBA diving and while my wife is certified, I am not, and we did not have all of the necessary gear and did not want to rent it all for a single cache. The other would have required considerably more drive time even though it is closer to where we are staying due to the need to approach from the opposite side of the lake. That left Soldier's Cave, one Doug spoke highly of and had me intrigued. My wife and I both like hiking, so a choice was made. I still needed two more caches. I intended to get them in the park but a wrong turn trying to find the parking area and I ended up getting the nearby virtual for #3998. Once parked, we went through the construction (so nice that they made a path for hikers to do this) and I signed Tipped Over! for #3999 (can't believe I overlooked it but my wife made the find). I passed a few others to get to Soldier's Cave. I had to use my phone to do this. My Oregon is in Nebraska having left it with a friend last week by accident. My eTrex was not working due to dead batteries. This meant that signal was not great along parts of the trail. The hike down the rocks was pretty cool. I was quite impressed by how it had the impression of being positioned more ornately, with winding, curving stairways. We saw a few lizards along the way too. Once done with the stairs, the waterfall area was nice. We saw a picture of what it looks like when it is flowing and that would have been fun to see. The trail was not as easy to follow there but we found the spot and climbed the rocks to continue. Eventually, we found a large cave. It seemed like a good spot but my phone said I was still 120 feet away. My wife stayed behind as I went forward. The phone was not changing and it got further away. I turned back and once at the cave entrance, I joined her in the search. After a few minutes, I happened to get at the right angle, well the right angle to see the cache but not for comfort. I signed the log and then my wife took some photos. After signing, we explored the cave. A pretty neat cave. It seems roomy for a single person, but it would have been cold in the winter. I took some pictures inside the cave as well before we took some more outside. Then we began the hike back. We both were a bit tired from the stairs but we also both enjoyed the hike. Thank you for placing this one here. I will add a favorite point, not just because this is officially my 4,000th find, but because we both had a lot of fun. And a thanks to Doug for recommending this one too me."

We really wanted to get to this cache as I saw it after it was first published and the logs looked intriguing. On our last several trips to Branson we just couldn't get the hike into our schedule with family groups, ice storms, etc. So today was the day, we thought. Unfortunately we have to post a DNF like the last log. Found everything as described and even gave the cave a good search to see if it had been ""misplaced"", but came up empty.

Day Two - in and around Branson: Out caching with Don't Call Me Sir, KevinP_JF, Lakeshore Cacher, thetruth7, tx Packrat and Mrs. tx Packrat. After the Flash Mob we set out to find this one. It was truly a destination cache for this trip. KevnP_JF, thetruth7, Ms tx Packrat and Don't Call Me Sir served together in Korea and it is only fitting that they find Soldier Cave together. So, the hike began. Down, down, down the steps we went. (That is a LOT of steps!) The trail to the cache site was wet and a bit slick but a slow steady pace made it a go for everyone involved. (8 adults and 3 kids in all.) The cache itself was pretty easy to find. The real ""treasure"" for us was the experience. As was said among our group several times - it was ""epic"". The soldiers took a pic in the cave and explored a bit. We all took in the scenery and the beautiful view of the river. We headed on down the trail to grab another cache and then it was back UP. We stopped at the waterfall and some of the group played around a bit. Then we began the climb back up ALL those steps. I know we will all feel this in the morning (or soon thereafter) but it was totally worth it. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work.

Well after reading this cache page description and looking at the pics we had to go for it. So we get to the parking and look at the trail map and the stairs pop out 700 plus stairs to deal with. Off we went such a nice walk through the woods then the stairs came, and came, and came. We arrived at the bottom only to find much more trail to go. Arriving at the cave site I was in the lead so Kevin and Tiffany had to come find me. It is hard to imagine living in this cave for so long its a long way anywhere and im sure his trail was no where near as nice as our walk in.

We are on vacation in Branson, and this was our last night in town. Our daughter got a text from a neighbor girl in our town that she too was in Branson, and they MUST must must meet up! So, we drove our daughter to her friend's hotel and decided to go after this cache in the two hours that we had to kill. I was a little worried about just how difficult it might be do to in the dark, with the rain from today making the steps slick, and the wet leaves adding to the slippery-ness, but my husband said we should go for it anyway. :) So, off we went. He didn't use a light at all, but I constantly burned my flashlight app on my phone along the way, so I would have any falls. We LOVED this cache. Thanks for bringing us here! He enjoyed the cave and talked about the books he read when he was younger. My friend Tallulahtulip told me about this cache over a year ago and said we should go for it, so glad that we did! We tried to take some pictures, but they didn't come out that great. We stayed here for a while, listening to the sounds of bats over the river, then made our ascent where we DNF'd a cache that we probably shouldn't have. We didn't have a lot of time to keep looking, so we had to give up on that one. Thanks for the memories! This entry was edited by go-purdue on Sunday, 28 October 2012 at 16:17:25 UTC."

What we didn't factor in was the humidity and the overlooked fact that we had to park our 14 month old son's stroller at the stairs and hike all 730 odd stairs with him in our arms or on our shoulders. Didn't bring the kiddo backpack to have him ride in! All in all it was a great little hike. Made it down and back in about 30 minutes to ensure we met up with my parents for more Branson sightseeing. Took some time to explore the cave and take some pictures. Thanks for a great natural adventure in the land of lights and corny shows!

Last year, Doug_hollyNKC happened to mention how much he liked this cache when he heard I was going to be in the area. I never made it over to the cache last year...and I am happy for that. This year, we traveled down for vacation with me sitting at 3,997 caches. I needed something for my 4,000th cache. I had my options narrowed down to only a few caches. This was one of them. It was a cache I probably would not have looked at if Doug had not mentioned it as we usually do not get over to Branson during the week we are here. Well, the other two options had a slight problem. One requires SCUBA diving and while my wife is certified, I am not, and we did not have all of the necessary gear and did not want to rent it all for a single cache. The other would have required considerably more drive time even though it is closer to where we are staying due to the need to approach from the opposite side of the lake. That left Soldier's Cave, one Doug spoke highly of and had me intrigued. My wife and I both like hiking, so a choice was made. I still needed two more caches. I intended to get them in the park but a wrong turn trying to find the parking area and I ended up getting the nearby virtual for #3998. Once parked, we went through the construction (so nice that they made a path for hikers to do this) and I signed Tipped Over! for #3999 (can't believe I overlooked it but my wife made the find). I passed a few others to get to Soldier's Cave. I had to use my phone to do this. My Oregon is in Nebraska having left it with a friend last week by accident. My eTrex was not working due to dead batteries. This meant that signal was not great along parts of the trail. The hike down the rocks was pretty cool. I was quite impressed by how it had the impression of being positioned more ornately, with winding, curving stairways. We saw a few lizards along the way too. Once done with the stairs, the waterfall area was nice. We saw a picture of what it looks like when it is flowing and that would have been fun to see. The trail was not as easy to follow there but we found the spot and climbed the rocks to continue. Eventually, we found a large cave. It seemed like a good spot but my phone said I was still 120 feet away. My wife stayed behind as I went forward. The phone was not changing and it got further away. I turned back and once at the cave entrance, I joined her in the search. After a few minutes, I happened to get at the right angle, well the right angle to see the cache but not for comfort. I signed the log and then my wife took some photos. After signing, we explored the cave. A pretty neat cave. It seems roomy for a single person, but it would have been cold in the winter. I took some pictures inside the cave as well before we took some more outside. Then we began the hike back. We both were a bit tired from the stairs but we also both enjoyed the hike. Thank you for placing this one here. I will add a favorite point, not just because this is officially my 4,000th find, but because we both had a lot of fun. And a thanks to Doug for recommending this one too me."

We really wanted to get to this cache as I saw it after it was first published and the logs looked intriguing. On our last several trips to Branson we just couldn't get the hike into our schedule with family groups, ice storms, etc. So today was the day, we thought. Unfortunately we have to post a DNF like the last log. Found everything as described and even gave the cave a good search to see if it had been ""misplaced"", but came up empty.

We are meeting up with some of Dane’s friends from when he was stationed in Korea. They haven’t seen each other since they left Korea all those years ago. Day Two - in and around Branson: Out caching with Don't Call Me Sir, KevinP_JF, Lakeshore Cacher, thetruth7, tx Packrat and Mrs. tx Packrat. After the Flash Mob we set out to find this one. It was truly a destination cache for this trip. KevnP_JF, thetruth7, Ms tx Packrat and Don't Call Me Sir served together in Korea and it is only fitting that they find Soldier Cave together. So, the hike began. Down, down, down the steps we went. (That is a LOT of steps!) The trail to the cache site was wet and a bit slick but a slow steady pace made it a go for everyone involved. (8 adults and 3 kids in all.) The cache itself was pretty easy to find. The real ""treasure"" for us was the experience. As was said among our group several times - it was ""epic"". The soldiers took a pic in the cave and explored a bit. We all took in the scenery and the beautiful view of the river. We headed on down the trail to grab another cache and then it was back UP. We stopped at the waterfall and some of the group played around a bit. Then we began the climb back up ALL those steps. I know we will all feel this in the morning (or soon thereafter) but it was totally worth it. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work. We really appreciate you adding to our caching fun. [/b][/Purple] This entry was edited by Team AZMO on Wednesday, 20 May 2015 at 22:32:40 UTC."

Off we went such a nice walk through the woods then the stairs came, and came, and came. We arrived at the bottom only to find much more trail to go. Arriving at the cave site I was in the lead so Kevin and Tiffany had to come find me. It is hard to imagine living in this cave for so long its a long way anywhere and im sure his trail was no where near as nice as our walk in.

We are on vacation in Branson, and this was our last night in town. Our daughter got a text from a neighbor girl in our town that she too was in Branson, and they MUST must must meet up! So, we drove our daughter to her friend's hotel and decided to go after this cache in the two hours that we had to kill. I was a little worried about just how difficult it might be do to in the dark, with the rain from today making the steps slick, and the wet leaves adding to the slippery-ness, but my husband said we should go for it anyway. :) So, off we went. He didn't use a light at all, but I constantly burned my flashlight app on my phone along the way, so I would have any falls. We LOVED this cache. Thanks for bringing us here! He enjoyed the cave and talked about the books he read when he was younger. My friend Tallulahtulip told me about this cache over a year ago and said we should go for it, so glad that we did! We tried to take some pictures, but they didn't come out that great. We stayed here for a while, listening to the sounds of bats over the river, then made our ascent where we DNF'd a cache that we probably shouldn't have. We didn't have a lot of time to keep looking, so we had to give up on that one. Thanks for the memories! This entry was edited by go-purdue on Sunday, 28 October 2012 at 16:17:25 UTC."

What we didn't factor in was the humidity and the overlooked fact that we had to park our 14 month old son's stroller at the stairs and hike all 730 odd stairs with him in our arms or on our shoulders. Didn't bring the kiddo backpack to have him ride in! All in all it was a great little hike. Made it down and back in about 30 minutes to ensure we met up with my parents for more Branson sightseeing.

Last year, Doug_hollyNKC happened to mention how much he liked this cache when he heard I was going to be in the area. I never made it over to the cache last year...and I am happy for that. This year, we traveled down for vacation with me sitting at 3,997 caches. I needed something for my 4,000th cache. I had my options narrowed down to only a few caches. This was one of them. It was a cache I probably would not have looked at if Doug had not mentioned it as we usually do not get over to Branson during the week we are here. Well, the other two options had a slight problem. One requires SCUBA diving and while my wife is certified, I am not, and we did not have all of the necessary gear and did not want to rent it all for a single cache. The other would have required considerably more drive time even though it is closer to where we are staying due to the need to approach from the opposite side of the lake. That left Soldier's Cave, one Doug spoke highly of and had me intrigued. My wife and I both like hiking, so a choice was made. I still needed two more caches. I intended to get them in the park but a wrong turn trying to find the parking area and I ended up getting the nearby virtual for #3998. Once parked, we went through the construction (so nice that they made a path for hikers to do this) and I signed Tipped Over! for #3999 (can't believe I overlooked it but my wife made the find). I passed a few others to get to Soldier's Cave. I had to use my phone to do this. My Oregon is in Nebraska having left it with a friend last week by accident. My eTrex was not working due to dead batteries. This meant that signal was not great along parts of the trail. The hike down the rocks was pretty cool. I was quite impressed by how it had the impression of being positioned more ornately, with winding, curving stairways. We saw a few lizards along the way too. Once done with the stairs, the waterfall area was nice. We saw a picture of what it looks like when it is flowing and that would have been fun to see. The trail was not as easy to follow there but we found the spot and climbed the rocks to continue. Eventually, we found a large cave. It seemed like a good spot but my phone said I was still 120 feet away. My wife stayed behind as I went forward. The phone was not changing and it got further away. I turned back and once at the cave entrance, I joined her in the search. After a few minutes, I happened to get at the right angle, well the right angle to see the cache but not for comfort. I signed the log and then my wife took some photos. After signing, we explored the cave. A pretty neat cave. It seems roomy for a single person, but it would have been cold in the winter. I took some pictures inside the cave as well before we took some more outside. Then we began the hike back. We both were a bit tired from the stairs but we also both enjoyed the hike. Thank you for placing this one here. I will add a favorite point, not just because this is officially my 4,000th find, but because we both had a lot of fun. And a thanks to Doug for recommending this one too me."

We are meeting up with some of Dane’s friends from when he was stationed in Korea. They haven’t seen each other since they left Korea all those years ago. Day Two - in and around Branson: Out caching with Don't Call Me Sir, KevinP_JF, Lakeshore Cacher, thetruth7, tx Packrat and Mrs. tx Packrat. After the Flash Mob we set out to find this one. It was truly a destination cache for this trip. KevnP_JF, thetruth7, Ms tx Packrat and Don't Call Me Sir served together in Korea and it is only fitting that they find Soldier Cave together. So, the hike began. Down, down, down the steps we went. (That is a LOT of steps!) The trail to the cache site was wet and a bit slick but a slow steady pace made it a go for everyone involved. (8 adults and 3 kids in all.) The cache itself was pretty easy to find. The real ""treasure"" for us was the experience. As was said among our group several times - it was ""epic"". The soldiers took a pic in the cave and explored a bit. We all took in the scenery and the beautiful view of the river. We headed on down the trail to grab another cache and then it was back UP. We stopped at the waterfall and some of the group played around a bit. Then we began the climb back up ALL those steps. I know we will all feel this in the morning (or soon thereafter) but it was totally worth it. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work. We really appreciate you adding to our caching fun. [/b][/Purple] This entry was edited by Team AZMO on Wednesday, 20 May 2015 at 22:32:40 UTC."

We are on vacation in Branson, and this was our last night in town. Our daughter got a text from a neighbor girl in our town that she too was in Branson, and they MUST must must meet up! So, we drove our daughter to her friend's hotel and decided to go after this cache in the two hours that we had to kill. I was a little worried about just how difficult it might be do to in the dark, with the rain from today making the steps slick, and the wet leaves adding to the slippery-ness, but my husband said we should go for it anyway. :) So, off we went. He didn't use a light at all, but I constantly burned my flashlight app on my phone along the way, so I would have any falls. We LOVED this cache. Thanks for bringing us here! He enjoyed the cave and talked about the books he read when he was younger. My friend Tallulahtulip told me about this cache over a year ago and said we should go for it, so glad that we did! We tried to take some pictures, but they didn't come out that great. We stayed here for a while, listening to the sounds of bats over the river, then made our ascent where we DNF'd a cache that we probably shouldn't have. We didn't have a lot of time to keep looking, so we had to give up on that one. Thanks for the memories! This entry was edited by go-purdue on Sunday, 28 October 2012 at 16:17:25 UTC."

What we didn't factor in was the humidity and the overlooked fact that we had to park our 14 month old son's stroller at the stairs and hike all 730 odd stairs with him in our arms or on our shoulders. Didn't bring the kiddo backpack to have him ride in! All in all it was a great little hike. Made it down and back in about 30 minutes to ensure we met up with my parents for more Branson sightseeing. Took some time to explore the cave and take some pictures. Thanks for a great natural adventure in the land of lights and corny shows!

Last year, Doug_hollyNKC happened to mention how much he liked this cache when he heard I was going to be in the area. I never made it over to the cache last year...and I am happy for that. This year, we traveled down for vacation with me sitting at 3,997 caches. I needed something for my 4,000th cache. I had my options narrowed down to only a few caches. This was one of them. It was a cache I probably would not have looked at if Doug had not mentioned it as we usually do not get over to Branson during the week we are here. Well, the other two options had a slight problem. One requires SCUBA diving and while my wife is certified, I am not, and we did not have all of the necessary gear and did not want to rent it all for a single cache. The other would have required considerably more drive time even though it is closer to where we are staying due to the need to approach from the opposite side of the lake. That left Soldier's Cave, one Doug spoke highly of and had me intrigued. My wife and I both like hiking, so a choice was made. I still needed two more caches. I intended to get them in the park but a wrong turn trying to find the parking area and I ended up getting the nearby virtual for #3998. Once parked, we went through the construction (so nice that they made a path for hikers to do this) and I signed Tipped Over! for #3999 (can't believe I overlooked it but my wife made the find). I passed a few others to get to Soldier's Cave. I had to use my phone to do this. My Oregon is in Nebraska having left it with a friend last week by accident. My eTrex was not working due to dead batteries. This meant that signal was not great along parts of the trail. The hike down the rocks was pretty cool. I was quite impressed by how it had the impression of being positioned more ornately, with winding, curving stairways. We saw a few lizards along the way too. Once done with the stairs, the waterfall area was nice. We saw a picture of what it looks like when it is flowing and that would have been fun to see. The trail was not as easy to follow there but we found the spot and climbed the rocks to continue. Eventually, we found a large cave. It seemed like a good spot but my phone said I was still 120 feet away. My wife stayed behind as I went forward. The phone was not changing and it got further away. I turned back and once at the cave entrance, I joined her in the search. After a few minutes, I happened to get at the right angle, well the right angle to see the cache but not for comfort. I signed the log and then my wife took some photos. After signing, we explored the cave. A pretty neat cave. It seems roomy for a single person, but it would have been cold in the winter. I took some pictures inside the cave as well before we took some more outside. Then we began the hike back. We both were a bit tired from the stairs but we also both enjoyed the hike. Thank you for placing this one here. I will add a favorite point, not just because this is officially my 4,000th find, but because we both had a lot of fun. And a thanks to Doug for recommending this one too me."

We are meeting up with some of Dane’s friends from when he was stationed in Korea. They haven’t seen each other since they left Korea all those years ago. Day Two - in and around Branson: Out caching with Don't Call Me Sir, KevinP_JF, Lakeshore Cacher, thetruth7, tx Packrat and Mrs. tx Packrat. After the Flash Mob we set out to find this one. It was truly a destination cache for this trip. KevnP_JF, thetruth7, Ms tx Packrat and Don't Call Me Sir served together in Korea and it is only fitting that they find Soldier Cave together. So, the hike began. Down, down, down the steps we went. (That is a LOT of steps!) The trail to the cache site was wet and a bit slick but a slow steady pace made it a go for everyone involved. (8 adults and 3 kids in all.) The cache itself was pretty easy to find. The real ""treasure"" for us was the experience. As was said among our group several times - it was ""epic"". The soldiers took a pic in the cave and explored a bit. We all took in the scenery and the beautiful view of the river. We headed on down the trail to grab another cache and then it was back UP. We stopped at the waterfall and some of the group played around a bit. Then we began the climb back up ALL those steps. I know we will all feel this in the morning (or soon thereafter) but it was totally worth it. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work.

Off we went such a nice walk through the woods then the stairs came, and came, and came. We arrived at the bottom only to find much more trail to go. Arriving at the cave site I was in the lead so Kevin and Tiffany had to come find me. It is hard to imagine living in this cave for so long its a long way anywhere and im sure his trail was no where near as nice as our walk in.

So, we drove our daughter to her friend's hotel and decided to go after this cache in the two hours that we had to kill. I was a little worried about just how difficult it might be do to in the dark, with the rain from today making the steps slick, and the wet leaves adding to the slippery-ness, but my husband said we should go for it anyway. :) So, off we went. He didn't use a light at all, but I constantly burned my flashlight app on my phone along the way, so I would have any falls. We LOVED this cache. Thanks for bringing us here! He enjoyed the cave and talked about the books he read when he was younger. My friend Tallulahtulip told me about this cache over a year ago and said we should go for it, so glad that we did! We tried to take some pictures, but they didn't come out that great. We stayed here for a while, listening to the sounds of bats over the river, then made our ascent where we DNF'd a cache that we probably shouldn't have. We didn't have a lot of time to keep looking, so we had to give up on that one. Thanks for the memories! This entry was edited by go-purdue on Sunday, 28 October 2012 at 16:17:25 UTC."

Last year, Doug_hollyNKC happened to mention how much he liked this cache when he heard I was going to be in the area. I never made it over to the cache last year...and I am happy for that. This year, we traveled down for vacation with me sitting at 3,997 caches. I needed something for my 4,000th cache. I had my options narrowed down to only a few caches. This was one of them. It was a cache I probably would not have looked at if Doug had not mentioned it as we usually do not get over to Branson during the week we are here. Well, the other two options had a slight problem. One requires SCUBA diving and while my wife is certified, I am not, and we did not have all of the necessary gear and did not want to rent it all for a single cache. The other would have required considerably more drive time even though it is closer to where we are staying due to the need to approach from the opposite side of the lake. That left Soldier's Cave, one Doug spoke highly of and had me intrigued. My wife and I both like hiking, so a choice was made. I still needed two more caches. I intended to get them in the park but a wrong turn trying to find the parking area and I ended up getting the nearby virtual for #3998. Once parked, we went through the construction (so nice that they made a path for hikers to do this) and I signed Tipped Over! for #3999 (can't believe I overlooked it but my wife made the find). I passed a few others to get to Soldier's Cave. I had to use my phone to do this. My Oregon is in Nebraska having left it with a friend last week by accident. My eTrex was not working due to dead batteries. This meant that signal was not great along parts of the trail. The hike down the rocks was pretty cool. I was quite impressed by how it had the impression of being positioned more ornately, with winding, curving stairways. We saw a few lizards along the way too. Once done with the stairs, the waterfall area was nice. We saw a picture of what it looks like when it is flowing and that would have been fun to see. The trail was not as easy to follow there but we found the spot and climbed the rocks to continue. Eventually, we found a large cave. It seemed like a good spot but my phone said I was still 120 feet away. My wife stayed behind as I went forward. The phone was not changing and it got further away. I turned back and once at the cave entrance, I joined her in the search. After a few minutes, I happened to get at the right angle, well the right angle to see the cache but not for comfort. I signed the log and then my wife took some photos. After signing, we explored the cave. A pretty neat cave. It seems roomy for a single person, but it would have been cold in the winter. I took some pictures inside the cave as well before we took some more outside. Then we began the hike back. We both were a bit tired from the stairs but we also both enjoyed the hike. Thank you for placing this one here. I will add a favorite point, not just because this is officially my 4,000th find, but because we both had a lot of fun. And a thanks to Doug for recommending this one too me."

We had been down this trail once before several years ago, but were excited about getting back and exploring the new caches here. We really wanted to get to this cache as I saw it after it was first published and the logs looked intriguing. On our last several trips to Branson we just couldn't get the hike into our schedule with family groups, ice storms, etc. So today was the day, we thought. Unfortunately we have to post a DNF like the last log. Found everything as described and even gave the cave a good search to see if it had been ""misplaced"", but came up empty. Glad we could carry on and get a find on the exciting ""Panther's View"" down the trail."

We are meeting up with some of Dane’s friends from when he was stationed in Korea. They haven’t seen each other since they left Korea all those years ago. Day Two - in and around Branson: Out caching with Don't Call Me Sir, KevinP_JF, Lakeshore Cacher, thetruth7, tx Packrat and Mrs. tx Packrat. After the Flash Mob we set out to find this one. It was truly a destination cache for this trip. KevnP_JF, thetruth7, Ms tx Packrat and Don't Call Me Sir served together in Korea and it is only fitting that they find Soldier Cave together. So, the hike began. Down, down, down the steps we went. (That is a LOT of steps!) The trail to the cache site was wet and a bit slick but a slow steady pace made it a go for everyone involved. (8 adults and 3 kids in all.) The cache itself was pretty easy to find. The real ""treasure"" for us was the experience. As was said among our group several times - it was ""epic"". The soldiers took a pic in the cave and explored a bit. We all took in the scenery and the beautiful view of the river. We headed on down the trail to grab another cache and then it was back UP. We stopped at the waterfall and some of the group played around a bit. Then we began the climb back up ALL those steps. I know we will all feel this in the morning (or soon thereafter) but it was totally worth it. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work.

Well after reading this cache page description and looking at the pics we had to go for it. So we get to the parking and look at the trail map and the stairs pop out 700 plus stairs to deal with. Off we went such a nice walk through the woods then the stairs came, and came, and came. We arrived at the bottom only to find much more trail to go. Arriving at the cave site I was in the lead so Kevin and Tiffany had to come find me. It is hard to imagine living in this cave for so long its a long way anywhere and im sure his trail was no where near as nice as our walk in. This was a great example of why I love geocaching you find places you would never see or know of EVER. Thanks for sharing this spot with us the excerise was just plan fun for this cache.

I was a little worried about just how difficult it might be do to in the dark, with the rain from today making the steps slick, and the wet leaves adding to the slippery-ness, but my husband said we should go for it anyway. :) So, off we went. He didn't use a light at all, but I constantly burned my flashlight app on my phone along the way, so I would have any falls. We LOVED this cache. Thanks for bringing us here! He enjoyed the cave and talked about the books he read when he was younger. My friend Tallulahtulip told me about this cache over a year ago and said we should go for it, so glad that we did! We tried to take some pictures, but they didn't come out that great. We stayed here for a while, listening to the sounds of bats over the river, then made our ascent where we DNF'd a cache that we probably shouldn't have. We didn't have a lot of time to keep looking, so we had to give up on that one. Thanks for the memories! This entry was edited by go-purdue on Sunday, 28 October 2012 at 16:17:25 UTC."

Last year, Doug_hollyNKC happened to mention how much he liked this cache when he heard I was going to be in the area. I never made it over to the cache last year...and I am happy for that. This year, we traveled down for vacation with me sitting at 3,997 caches. I needed something for my 4,000th cache. I had my options narrowed down to only a few caches. This was one of them. It was a cache I probably would not have looked at if Doug had not mentioned it as we usually do not get over to Branson during the week we are here. Well, the other two options had a slight problem. One requires SCUBA diving and while my wife is certified, I am not, and we did not have all of the necessary gear and did not want to rent it all for a single cache. The other would have required considerably more drive time even though it is closer to where we are staying due to the need to approach from the opposite side of the lake. That left Soldier's Cave, one Doug spoke highly of and had me intrigued. My wife and I both like hiking, so a choice was made. I still needed two more caches. I intended to get them in the park but a wrong turn trying to find the parking area and I ended up getting the nearby virtual for #3998. Once parked, we went through the construction (so nice that they made a path for hikers to do this) and I signed Tipped Over! for #3999 (can't believe I overlooked it but my wife made the find). I passed a few others to get to Soldier's Cave. I had to use my phone to do this. My Oregon is in Nebraska having left it with a friend last week by accident. My eTrex was not working due to dead batteries. This meant that signal was not great along parts of the trail. The hike down the rocks was pretty cool. I was quite impressed by how it had the impression of being positioned more ornately, with winding, curving stairways. We saw a few lizards along the way too. Once done with the stairs, the waterfall area was nice. We saw a picture of what it looks like when it is flowing and that would have been fun to see. The trail was not as easy to follow there but we found the spot and climbed the rocks to continue. Eventually, we found a large cave. It seemed like a good spot but my phone said I was still 120 feet away. My wife stayed behind as I went forward. The phone was not changing and it got further away. I turned back and once at the cave entrance, I joined her in the search. After a few minutes, I happened to get at the right angle, well the right angle to see the cache but not for comfort. I signed the log and then my wife took some photos. After signing, we explored the cave. A pretty neat cave. It seems roomy for a single person, but it would have been cold in the winter. I took some pictures inside the cave as well before we took some more outside. Then we began the hike back. We both were a bit tired from the stairs but we also both enjoyed the hike. Thank you for placing this one here. I will add a favorite point, not just because this is officially my 4,000th find, but because we both had a lot of fun. And a thanks to Doug for recommending this one too me."

We really wanted to get to this cache as I saw it after it was first published and the logs looked intriguing. On our last several trips to Branson we just couldn't get the hike into our schedule with family groups, ice storms, etc. So today was the day, we thought. Unfortunately we have to post a DNF like the last log. Found everything as described and even gave the cave a good search to see if it had been ""misplaced"", but came up empty. Glad we could carry on and get a find on the exciting ""Panther's View"" down the trail."

Day Two - in and around Branson: Out caching with Don't Call Me Sir, KevinP_JF, Lakeshore Cacher, thetruth7, tx Packrat and Mrs. tx Packrat. After the Flash Mob we set out to find this one. It was truly a destination cache for this trip. KevnP_JF, thetruth7, Ms tx Packrat and Don't Call Me Sir served together in Korea and it is only fitting that they find Soldier Cave together. So, the hike began. Down, down, down the steps we went. (That is a LOT of steps!) The trail to the cache site was wet and a bit slick but a slow steady pace made it a go for everyone involved. (8 adults and 3 kids in all.) The cache itself was pretty easy to find. The real ""treasure"" for us was the experience. As was said among our group several times - it was ""epic"". The soldiers took a pic in the cave and explored a bit. We all took in the scenery and the beautiful view of the river. We headed on down the trail to grab another cache and then it was back UP. We stopped at the waterfall and some of the group played around a bit. Then we began the climb back up ALL those steps. I know we will all feel this in the morning (or soon thereafter) but it was totally worth it. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work.

Love the caches that take you to interesting places!! SL TFTC!! This entry was edited by Scuba.Green on Wednesday, 27 March 2013 at 20:32:29 UTC."

Off we went such a nice walk through the woods then the stairs came, and came, and came. We arrived at the bottom only to find much more trail to go. Arriving at the cave site I was in the lead so Kevin and Tiffany had to come find me. It is hard to imagine living in this cave for so long its a long way anywhere and im sure his trail was no where near as nice as our walk in.

So, we drove our daughter to her friend's hotel and decided to go after this cache in the two hours that we had to kill. I was a little worried about just how difficult it might be do to in the dark, with the rain from today making the steps slick, and the wet leaves adding to the slippery-ness, but my husband said we should go for it anyway. :) So, off we went. He didn't use a light at all, but I constantly burned my flashlight app on my phone along the way, so I would have any falls. We LOVED this cache. Thanks for bringing us here! He enjoyed the cave and talked about the books he read when he was younger. My friend Tallulahtulip told me about this cache over a year ago and said we should go for it, so glad that we did! We tried to take some pictures, but they didn't come out that great. We stayed here for a while, listening to the sounds of bats over the river, then made our ascent where we DNF'd a cache that we probably shouldn't have. We didn't have a lot of time to keep looking, so we had to give up on that one. Thanks for the memories! This entry was edited by go-purdue on Sunday, 28 October 2012 at 16:17:25 UTC."

Boy did we underestimate the terrain rating! We're used to climbing 500 - 1000 ft to grab caches in the mountains all over AZ. What we didn't factor in was the humidity and the overlooked fact that we had to park our 14 month old son's stroller at the stairs and hike all 730 odd stairs with him in our arms or on our shoulders. Didn't bring the kiddo backpack to have him ride in! All in all it was a great little hike. Made it down and back in about 30 minutes to ensure we met up with my parents for more Branson sightseeing. Took some time to explore the cave and take some pictures. Thanks for a great natural adventure in the land of lights and corny shows! Yet again an opportunity to visit a place we never would have found if it wasn't for Geocaching."

Last year, Doug_hollyNKC happened to mention how much he liked this cache when he heard I was going to be in the area. I never made it over to the cache last year...and I am happy for that. This year, we traveled down for vacation with me sitting at 3,997 caches. I needed something for my 4,000th cache. I had my options narrowed down to only a few caches. This was one of them. It was a cache I probably would not have looked at if Doug had not mentioned it as we usually do not get over to Branson during the week we are here. Well, the other two options had a slight problem. One requires SCUBA diving and while my wife is certified, I am not, and we did not have all of the necessary gear and did not want to rent it all for a single cache. The other would have required considerably more drive time even though it is closer to where we are staying due to the need to approach from the opposite side of the lake. That left Soldier's Cave, one Doug spoke highly of and had me intrigued. My wife and I both like hiking, so a choice was made. I still needed two more caches. I intended to get them in the park but a wrong turn trying to find the parking area and I ended up getting the nearby virtual for #3998. Once parked, we went through the construction (so nice that they made a path for hikers to do this) and I signed Tipped Over! for #3999 (can't believe I overlooked it but my wife made the find). I passed a few others to get to Soldier's Cave. I had to use my phone to do this. My Oregon is in Nebraska having left it with a friend last week by accident. My eTrex was not working due to dead batteries. This meant that signal was not great along parts of the trail. The hike down the rocks was pretty cool. I was quite impressed by how it had the impression of being positioned more ornately, with winding, curving stairways. We saw a few lizards along the way too. Once done with the stairs, the waterfall area was nice. We saw a picture of what it looks like when it is flowing and that would have been fun to see. The trail was not as easy to follow there but we found the spot and climbed the rocks to continue. Eventually, we found a large cave. It seemed like a good spot but my phone said I was still 120 feet away. My wife stayed behind as I went forward. The phone was not changing and it got further away. I turned back and once at the cave entrance, I joined her in the search. After a few minutes, I happened to get at the right angle, well the right angle to see the cache but not for comfort. I signed the log and then my wife took some photos. After signing, we explored the cave. A pretty neat cave. It seems roomy for a single person, but it would have been cold in the winter. I took some pictures inside the cave as well before we took some more outside. Then we began the hike back. We both were a bit tired from the stairs but we also both enjoyed the hike. Thank you for placing this one here. I will add a favorite point, not just because this is officially my 4,000th find, but because we both had a lot of fun. And a thanks to Doug for recommending this one too me."

We really wanted to get to this cache as I saw it after it was first published and the logs looked intriguing. On our last several trips to Branson we just couldn't get the hike into our schedule with family groups, ice storms, etc. So today was the day, we thought. Unfortunately we have to post a DNF like the last log. Found everything as described and even gave the cave a good search to see if it had been ""misplaced"", but came up empty. Glad we could carry on and get a find on the exciting ""Panther's View"" down the trail."

Day Two - in and around Branson: Out caching with Don't Call Me Sir, KevinP_JF, Lakeshore Cacher, thetruth7, tx Packrat and Mrs. tx Packrat. After the Flash Mob we set out to find this one. It was truly a destination cache for this trip. KevnP_JF, thetruth7, Ms tx Packrat and Don't Call Me Sir served together in Korea and it is only fitting that they find Soldier Cave together. So, the hike began. Down, down, down the steps we went. (That is a LOT of steps!) The trail to the cache site was wet and a bit slick but a slow steady pace made it a go for everyone involved. (8 adults and 3 kids in all.) The cache itself was pretty easy to find. The real ""treasure"" for us was the experience. As was said among our group several times - it was ""epic"". The soldiers took a pic in the cave and explored a bit. We all took in the scenery and the beautiful view of the river. We headed on down the trail to grab another cache and then it was back UP. We stopped at the waterfall and some of the group played around a bit. Then we began the climb back up ALL those steps. I know we will all feel this in the morning (or soon thereafter) but it was totally worth it. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work.

Off we went such a nice walk through the woods then the stairs came, and came, and came. We arrived at the bottom only to find much more trail to go. Arriving at the cave site I was in the lead so Kevin and Tiffany had to come find me. It is hard to imagine living in this cave for so long its a long way anywhere and im sure his trail was no where near as nice as our walk in.

So, we drove our daughter to her friend's hotel and decided to go after this cache in the two hours that we had to kill. I was a little worried about just how difficult it might be do to in the dark, with the rain from today making the steps slick, and the wet leaves adding to the slippery-ness, but my husband said we should go for it anyway. :) So, off we went. He didn't use a light at all, but I constantly burned my flashlight app on my phone along the way, so I would have any falls. We LOVED this cache. Thanks for bringing us here! He enjoyed the cave and talked about the books he read when he was younger. My friend Tallulahtulip told me about this cache over a year ago and said we should go for it, so glad that we did! We tried to take some pictures, but they didn't come out that great. We stayed here for a while, listening to the sounds of bats over the river, then made our ascent where we DNF'd a cache that we probably shouldn't have. We didn't have a lot of time to keep looking, so we had to give up on that one. Thanks for the memories! This entry was edited by go-purdue on Sunday, 28 October 2012 at 16:17:25 UTC."

Grabbed a few I missed on the roads and then went hiking. Thanks for the cache The wife was concerned that I would not get back in time for the show. I said I be back in about 30 minutes. So, I made a mad dash down the step only stopping to get by a unleashed dog on the rock seat with it owner. I met a woman on the way back up and she said her mother and my wife were talking up above. So, I got back with plenty time to spare and enjoyed the show later. a favorite from me......"

We both are interested in the local stories and this was quite the adventure. We also found a few of the other smaller caves in the area. Many people taking the steps challenge. We passed old, young and out of breath, perspiring people. Wonderful combination of adventure and exercise. TFTC!"

Boy did we underestimate the terrain rating! We're used to climbing 500 - 1000 ft to grab caches in the mountains all over AZ. What we didn't factor in was the humidity and the overlooked fact that we had to park our 14 month old son's stroller at the stairs and hike all 730 odd stairs with him in our arms or on our shoulders. Didn't bring the kiddo backpack to have him ride in! All in all it was a great little hike. Made it down and back in about 30 minutes to ensure we met up with my parents for more Branson sightseeing. Took some time to explore the cave and take some pictures. Thanks for a great natural adventure in the land of lights and corny shows! Yet again an opportunity to visit a place we never would have found if it wasn't for Geocaching."

Started the the day off with a nice 3 mile hike around the nature center. In a word Awesome. Had to resort to the cache outside the cave as couldn't find the version inside. Was a wonderful hike to the cache other than the 338 steps down and then back up, and that part of the trail was under fallen tree and rockslide. Otherwise loved the experience."
