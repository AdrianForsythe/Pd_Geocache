I just needed this one more earthcache for my 190th so we just had to stop and find Cave Spring. I'm not sure where we are, but glad Parzan has 4-wheel drive as this road nearest cache is really not much of a road at all. We make it to the top and it dead ends into someone's house. It is twisty-turny, snowy, muddy and full of pot holes and very skinny to boot . . .like I said, not much of a road at all, but hey cache is only 300 and some feet so we find a place to pull over and off we go. As we are going into trail a man walks by and warns us about the pitt bull dogs that the people in the house let roam. Parzan is pretty uneasy about this so we head down trail quickly. I'm determined to get this one more earthcache. I told him we are allowed to be here, it is a legit trail around Buffalo Lake, but then again we never did see any lake?!?! We go down trail and then take side trail down to creek and come upon Cave Spring. WOW-I wouldof never known this cave was back in here if it wasn't for this earthcache. You never know what your gonna find going after an out-of-the-way earthcache.

I just needed this one more earthcache for my 190th so we just had to stop and find Cave Spring. I'm not sure where we are, but glad Parzan has 4-wheel drive as this road nearest cache is really not much of a road at all. We make it to the top and it dead ends into someone's house. It is twisty-turny, snowy, muddy and full of pot holes and very skinny to boot . . .like I said, not much of a road at all, but hey cache is only 300 and some feet so we find a place to pull over and off we go. As we are going into trail a man walks by and warns us about the pitt bull dogs that the people in the house let roam. Parzan is pretty uneasy about this so we head down trail quickly. I'm determined to get this one more earthcache. I told him we are allowed to be here, it is a legit trail around Buffalo Lake, but then again we never did see any lake?!?! We go down trail and then take side trail down to creek and come upon Cave Spring. WOW-I wouldof never known this cave was back in here if it wasn't for this earthcache. You never know what your gonna find going after an out-of-the-way earthcache.

I just needed this one more earthcache for my 190th so we just had to stop and find Cave Spring. I'm not sure where we are, but glad Parzan has 4-wheel drive as this road nearest cache is really not much of a road at all. We make it to the top and it dead ends into someone's house. It is twisty-turny, snowy, muddy and full of pot holes and very skinny to boot . . .like I said, not much of a road at all, but hey cache is only 300 and some feet so we find a place to pull over and off we go. As we are going into trail a man walks by and warns us about the pitt bull dogs that the people in the house let roam. Parzan is pretty uneasy about this so we head down trail quickly. I'm determined to get this one more earthcache. I told him we are allowed to be here, it is a legit trail around Buffalo Lake, but then again we never did see any lake?!?! We go down trail and then take side trail down to creek and come upon Cave Spring. WOW-I wouldof never known this cave was back in here if it wasn't for this earthcache. You never know what your gonna find going after an out-of-the-way earthcache.

I just needed this one more earthcache for my 190th so we just had to stop and find Cave Spring. I'm not sure where we are, but glad Parzan has 4-wheel drive as this road nearest cache is really not much of a road at all. We make it to the top and it dead ends into someone's house. It is twisty-turny, snowy, muddy and full of pot holes and very skinny to boot . . .like I said, not much of a road at all, but hey cache is only 300 and some feet so we find a place to pull over and off we go. As we are going into trail a man walks by and warns us about the pitt bull dogs that the people in the house let roam. Parzan is pretty uneasy about this so we head down trail quickly. I'm determined to get this one more earthcache. I told him we are allowed to be here, it is a legit trail around Buffalo Lake, but then again we never did see any lake?!?! We go down trail and then take side trail down to creek and come upon Cave Spring. WOW-I wouldof never known this cave was back in here if it wasn't for this earthcache. You never know what your gonna find going after an out-of-the-way earthcache. Thanks for bringing us here today and the information on Cave Spring also . . . this area is rich in history (as is most of Kentucky) . . . I love this state!!! And, earthcaches too!!!

As we are going into trail a man walks by and warns us about the pitt bull dogs that the people in the house let roam. Parzan is pretty uneasy about this so we head down trail quickly. I'm determined to get this one more earthcache. I told him we are allowed to be here, it is a legit trail around Buffalo Lake, but then again we never did see any lake?!?! We go down trail and then take side trail down to creek and come upon Cave Spring. WOW-I wouldof never known this cave was back in here if it wasn't for this earthcache. You never know what your gonna find going after an out-of-the-way earthcache. Thanks for bringing us here today and the information on Cave Spring also . . . this area is rich in history (as is most of Kentucky) . . . I love this state!!! And, earthcaches too!!!

I just needed this one more earthcache for my 190th so we just had to stop and find Cave Spring. I'm not sure where we are, but glad Parzan has 4-wheel drive as this road nearest cache is really not much of a road at all. We make it to the top and it dead ends into someone's house. It is twisty-turny, snowy, muddy and full of pot holes and very skinny to boot . . .like I said, not much of a road at all, but hey cache is only 300 and some feet so we find a place to pull over and off we go. As we are going into trail a man walks by and warns us about the pitt bull dogs that the people in the house let roam. Parzan is pretty uneasy about this so we head down trail quickly. I'm determined to get this one more earthcache. I told him we are allowed to be here, it is a legit trail around Buffalo Lake, but then again we never did see any lake?!?! We go down trail and then take side trail down to creek and come upon Cave Spring. WOW-I wouldof never known this cave was back in here if it wasn't for this earthcache. You never know what your gonna find going after an out-of-the-way earthcache. Thanks for bringing us here today and the information on Cave Spring also . . . this area is rich in history (as is most of Kentucky) . . . I love this state!!! And, earthcaches too!!!

I just needed this one more earthcache for my 190th so we just had to stop and find Cave Spring. I'm not sure where we are, but glad Parzan has 4-wheel drive as this road nearest cache is really not much of a road at all. We make it to the top and it dead ends into someone's house. It is twisty-turny, snowy, muddy and full of pot holes and very skinny to boot . . .like I said, not much of a road at all, but hey cache is only 300 and some feet so we find a place to pull over and off we go. As we are going into trail a man walks by and warns us about the pitt bull dogs that the people in the house let roam. Parzan is pretty uneasy about this so we head down trail quickly. I'm determined to get this one more earthcache. I told him we are allowed to be here, it is a legit trail around Buffalo Lake, but then again we never did see any lake?!?! We go down trail and then take side trail down to creek and come upon Cave Spring. WOW-I wouldof never known this cave was back in here if it wasn't for this earthcache. You never know what your gonna find going after an out-of-the-way earthcache. Thanks for bringing us here today and the information on Cave Spring also . . . this area is rich in history (as is most of Kentucky) . . . I love this state!!! And, earthcaches too!!!

I just needed this one more earthcache for my 190th so we just had to stop and find Cave Spring. I'm not sure where we are, but glad Parzan has 4-wheel drive as this road nearest cache is really not much of a road at all. We make it to the top and it dead ends into someone's house. It is twisty-turny, snowy, muddy and full of pot holes and very skinny to boot . . .like I said, not much of a road at all, but hey cache is only 300 and some feet so we find a place to pull over and off we go. As we are going into trail a man walks by and warns us about the pitt bull dogs that the people in the house let roam. Parzan is pretty uneasy about this so we head down trail quickly. I'm determined to get this one more earthcache. I told him we are allowed to be here, it is a legit trail around Buffalo Lake, but then again we never did see any lake?!?! We go down trail and then take side trail down to creek and come upon Cave Spring. WOW-I wouldof never known this cave was back in here if it wasn't for this earthcache. You never know what your gonna find going after an out-of-the-way earthcache. Thanks for bringing us here today and the information on Cave Spring also . . . this area is rich in history (as is most of Kentucky) . . . I love this state!!! And, earthcaches too!!!

The page mentions how to get to the cave, when it is open, what is there, etc... Sounds to me like your group wants people (cavers and non-cavers alike) to experience this natural wonder. 2, Why even open it to the public? Your organization has obviously done a great job conserving the cave and its area and if you are concerned about vandalism, why is the area not marked off as private property? I see your point about being concerned about visitors' safety, but I don't think geocaching is your root problem. Either close the area off from the public and cease advertisement of the area or don't complain when other people learn about the cave."

In the past, many caves have been vandaled and ruined by careless people who do not know any better. I would like to speak as a member of the caving community in saying that we strive very hard to keep caves in a natural state. Often it requires gating and physically keeping people out. We even limit our own visitation to many caves due to the sensitive nature of the environment (bats or formations, for instance). There are many reasons to be protective of caves and keep people, who do not understand how dangerous some of them are, out. Ironically, the cave in question, is one of the most dangerous caves in the state. It's alluring entrance looks easy and many have explored near the entrance. However, this cave has KILLED! Period. The water flow in the cave is unpredictable and very dangerous besides many other unforeseen dangers. But, that is only one reason to put up wards against thoughtless visitors. Word of mouth spreads quickly and usually gets to the wrong person(s) and this particular cave has been graffitied (sp?) horribly bad in the past. In fact, there have been arrests made at the site for just that. These people find these caves and destroy them. We are not saying that Geocachers are the vandals, rather that the information of it's location could be passed on to a person without care of it's natural beauty and dangers. It is just better that all caves be kept out of the GeoCacheing trend, for the caves and for those who are unaware of the dangers of going to them.

This cache was never intended to offend any single person or group. It was not intended to do anything except give geocachers a wonderful natural area to visit on their travels. I will aslo state that if the NSS would have posted all of their rules at the cave site, none of this would have ever been an issue. From some of the forums I have read, the NSS even stated this site would make a good place for a cache. I'm not saying that we weren't wrong in not asking permission, although if this would have been originally used as a virtual cache site, there would have been no legal grounds for any opposition, since this cave is listed on a publicly viewed website and since there are no rules stated at the site to say otherwise. You can also say that if there have been so many problems at this location, then the NSS should have posted No Trespassing signs on the property. I still believe that Geocachers help protect and clean-up areas such as this, because most of us don't want to see a place like this destroyed any more than the NSS or any other group does. Vandals come in many shapes and sizes and for anyone to specify that geocachers are vandals, this person needs to look within their own group, since many of them are geocachers. On a personal note, I have been inundated with enough e-mail to consider myself a business, so if anybody has problems, please voice them on the forums not through my personal e-mail. I'm not one to hold a grudge, but I will state that since some of the NSS members have attacked us in such an aggressive manner, I'm glad that I was able to retrieve not only my donation check to the NSS for the Tytoona Cave, but also my check to PCC for the T-shirts and bumper stickers that I bought to place in the cache. Anyway, no hard feelings on this side, but I hope my friends in the business & volunteer communities, enjoyed reading the e-mails I've been sending to them. They usually don't like having their friends threatened. Thanks, The Buzzard's"

I thought I had better pass it along to you and geocaching.com: Hello Tytoona Committee and others concerned: It was brought to my attention that Tytoona Cave is now listed on the Geo Cache website and apparently someone has placed an item in the cave for all the geo cacher's to find. If you're not sure what Geo Cache is, it is where people with GPS units go and hide items in different locations across the United States. Then clues, coordinates and even maps are presented on the web to make the search easy for everyone to find. While it may seem to be a harmless way to enjoy the outdoors with some fun, it also creates problems for others trying to protect sensitive sites. I don't have to tell you that Tytoona has suffered vandal problems in the past and I think we have been doing a good job of protecting Tytoona through property inspections and having the State Police make arrests when needed. This new information of Tytoona being on the Geo Cache really disturbs me! Whoever went in the cave and placed the items then publicized it on the web, did so illegally and with out any permission what so ever. This will also make it easier for vandals to find and locate the cave now. I also feel that Geo Caching in caves is a hobby that exploits caves and has nothing to do with any conservation practices or particular cave interest. The bad consequences to the cave of someone entering and trashing it in the attempt to find a hidden item through Geo Cache is very high and is not only unacceptable but illegal. Tytoona is not only protected as private property through management, it is also protected by the laws of Pennsylvania (Pa. Cave Law). I also believe that the NSS have commented about Geo Caches in the past and that they forbid any Geo cache in NSS owned caves. Therefore, I will make a trip to Tytoona and see if this Geo Cache exists. If it is found, I will remove it as evidence and possibly have the State Police investigate as to prosecution. Right now, I'd say the items can be considered at littering in the cave and I'm sure other laws may have been broken. I welcome any help from the Tytoona Committee in contacting the Geo Cache website, to ask that they remove Tytoona from any listing and that they tell their membership not to use the Tytoona Cave Preserve for Geo Cache purposes. I hope that they will accommodate our request with out any further action needed, especially since they have done well so far at incriminating themselves. You can see the Tytoona Geo Cache website at http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.asp?ID=36175 If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to ask. Yours in Caving, Garrett Czmor, NSS 22709(R)(FE) NSS Manager & Committee Chair for the Tytoona Cave Preserve."
