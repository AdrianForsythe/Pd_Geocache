Keystone	Archive	11/26/2007	Since my prior note, there's been no update or action from the cache owner, so I am archiving this listing.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
Keystone	Post Reviewer Note	11/10/2007	Greetings from Geocaching.com I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled for well in excess of the period of 'a few weeks' as contemplated by the cache guidelines published on Geocaching.com. http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint While Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location. Also, if you haven't done so already, please pick up any remaining cache bits as soon as possible. If there is a good reason for a long delay in enabling this cache, please post an update on the cache page so that everyone will know what's going on. I've placed this cache on a bookmark list, and I will check back in two weeks or so to make sure that the issue has been addressed. If not, then I'll need to archive this cache for lack of maintenance. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching, and I'm looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future. Thanks for your understanding, Keystone Geocaching.com Volunteer Cache Reviewer	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
glorya	Temporarily Disable Listing	8/30/2007	Alright I just found the note that was left for me that says this cache was probably muggled out... darn them anyway!!! The good news is I've been looking for a new container for this cache anyway cause a few other logs say it's been damp or wet a few times...so this'll just get me into gear that much quicker!!! I'll let you all know when it's up and running again! Muggles....*sigh*	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
rustyspinner	Write note	8/25/2007	I am afraid this one might have been muggled. I found a tupperware type container with a bunch of ziplock bags near where the coords took me. It looks like someone emptied it and left the container. Just in case, I looked for quite a while and didn't find the cache. I had a wonderful time exploring the area though and can't wait to go back.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
Grandpa and Grandma	Found it	8/11/2007	We have been wanting to do this one for quite sometime...we finally got there...WOW what a neat area. We were with keystonecanoer, who had been here two previous times, so she knew the area...armed with 3 GPS we circled the area and Grandpa's was right on. Found it without a problem. Thanks for bringing us to the area.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
keystonecanoer	Found it	8/11/2007	Third time must be the charm for me in this cache. In with Grandpa and Grandma, and armed with a clue from two previous finders, we quickly found the cache. It is pretty damp inside - we tried to dry it out, but some of the swag was wet, so the interior will soon be wet again. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
scottyg	Found it	7/25/2007	Here on vacation from NC. found this one with my brother rgusto. This one was a hard find. but we didnt give up and soon had the cache in hand, we spent lots of time climbing around on the rocks after. Great to be back in Pa. Thanks for the cache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
rgusto	Found it	7/25/2007	Found this one after much searching, the coordinates where right on. Out caching with scottyg from NC. Met a group from Wesley Woods out rock climbing. Had not been here for years.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
cupprof	Found it	7/20/2007	The family was together again and found this cache despite the muggles. Had a little trouble finding this due to the satellite signals going in and out, but the youngest member of the clan found this one. TFTC! Great location, had a lot of fun exploring the caves and rocks. Left a matchbox car. Took the Otter Travel Bug for a new excursion.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache

maz884	Found it	7/14/2007	This was a creative hide. Other forest caches are very easy quick finds but this one was a little tricky. Thanks! T - geocache poker chip L - otter travel bug	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
mcm_squared	Found it	6/14/2007	Finally! Enlisted help of a tour guide and made this one a lunch time run. The cache is only 2.5 miles from my house. Of course I had to drive about 15 to get to the cache...... Nice walk in and was glad I brought a tour guide as it was a pretty good hide. Spent some time exploring and checking out the rocks and caves. It's hard to belive that I have never been here before. TFTC M	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
geekygrrl	Needs Maintenance	5/29/2007	Cache was a little wet inside. I dumped the water and dried it out the best I could.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
geekygrrl	Found it	5/26/2007	This was one of those caches that makes you glad to be a geocacher. If not for this sport we never would have gotten to see this cool place-especially since the land is POSTED...That was our first obstacle. (We once again didn't have the cache page!) After driving around looking for other ways in, we decided to stop & ask a local...she told us that the land is only posted to keep hunters out and that the guy who owns it let's people go down as long as they keep it clean. So, down we went. On arrival we quickly realized we were not alone! There was a group of people there with tents set up. They weren't really interested in us anyway, so we went and looked at the caves and then set about looking for the cache. GPS signals were everywhere, but sw6x finally found it. T-smokey the bear zipper pull & elephant L-matchbox car & stamp SL, TFTC After replacing the cache, we went back to check out the caves some more. Suddenly, two more muggles - or geocachers? - appeared. The one asked sw6x if that was a GPSr he had... Thunder started and we headed out of there right quick! FYI, After the cache we stopped down the road at the River Forks restaurant. The buffet was good and the dessert bar was yummy - and the view from the deck was beautiful...even in a thunderstorm! Located 2 miles south of Tionesta on 62 - no address given on website!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
goldsnoop-	Found it	4/29/2007	Finally getting around to logging the end of this GeoRun with Tprints. I'm a little behind. Tprints had a DNF on the very tricky hide. I was off the coordintes working my towards GZ. There I searched for quite a while. Still no smiley. I had to think about some of my ticky wood hides. Then I searched in a new direction and there it was. Great hide. Very enjoyable cache and location. Thanks.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
Tprints	Found it	4/29/2007	Finally got back to make another stab at this one. Started at ground zero and still didn't see anything in the obvious places. Hmmmm, that reminds me of the first time here. Then we spread out with still no luck. As we both made our way back to GZ to intensify our search there, Snoop finally spotted it. Very tricky hide indeed. Coordinates are very good but the hide is excellent. Now it was time to check out the rocks. Quite a drop-off in some places. Yikes! I don't like heights that much but Snoop is even worse I think. This place was great though and I had fun jumping around from one place to another until it was time to move on. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
schabinski	Didn't find it	1/7/2007	WE couldn't find the Geocache but we did find the chair with the hole cut out. Ha Ha. or should I say we found the toilet. Lots of trash laying about and no geocache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
Grammy K	Found it	1/3/2007	Found this one with lknox	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
lknox	Found it	1/3/2007	I was quite surprised, I had little trouble finding it, actually my wife spotted it. It was right where it was supposed to be. We checked out the rocks, I showed her where we took the Boy Scouts to repell off of Kissface rock. Of course she thought we were all nuts. Talked to three kids then watched them enter panther caves they were still down in there when we left. Got back to the car just before dark. Thanks	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
Kaslow	Found it	1/1/2007	I got lucky on this one because a little bit of one corner was showing. Thanks.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
jhwjohn	Found it	12/23/2006	Nice cache close where were staying for Christmas, Henry's Bend! Wasnt very optimistic when starting the hike from the DNFs but I did want to see the caves. It was getting dark and didnt see any caves. But I did find the cache after a few minutes search while the GPS was settling down. After standing still for a few minutes the coordinates were dead on. Nice cache and very nice hike. TFTC! If there was only some snow to go snowcaching, dont get to do that often in FL.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
glorya	Write note	10/29/2006	It's seeming that maybe it's time I got back out there and checked on this cache but the weather has been so lousy lately and getting worse. If a nice day ever comes back I'll be going to check on this. But until then I'm so sorry to those who haven't been able to find it. Actually it kind of surprises me on some of the days a few of you have logged your entry for this...haven't all been very nice days to be out! Even if your a duck!! But I guess I really shouldn't be too surprised should I? I see some of you out there are really die-hard geocachers!! Glorya	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
Rev Mike	Didn't find it	10/21/2006	YYAAARRR !!! This is not only a DNF but is now at the top of my list of DNFs that I need to clear up. We looked for about an hour - no sign of the cache. I even found a camping chair. I will be back soon for this one and I wonder if the owner could take a look to see if everything is in order. Rev Mike	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
Tprints	Didn't find it	10/21/2006	Dang! The cache we were mainly looking forward to but it ends up with a DNF. I think there are just too many leaves on the ground now as we looked for a pretty good long time with no luck. Poked and proded all over the place but never came up with a thing. The only DNF out of close to 60 caches so it was still a productive weekend. Couldn't even enjoy the rocks due to the disappoinment of not finding the cache. That will have to wait until a return trip to hopefully find it. TFTH	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
BusyMamaBee	Found it	9/23/2006	OUt with GKellogg for a quick cache before a meeting. Almost gave up before we go to it! Great location overall!! Thanks! ~Mamabee	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
gkellogg	Found it	9/23/2006	Busymamabee and I went out to grab this cache before a meeting. Great hike - and an awesome place to hide a cache. I know a lot of people that said "I was going to hide a cache there" - I have heard of Panthers Cave all of my life, I know people that have camped here, repelled here, spelunked here and other things that I can't mention here - but I have never been out here before and I can't wait to bring my husband and come out here again!!! I love this sport!!! Oh - forgot to mention that we drove to the general store pulled over to program in the co-ords and we realized that neither of us had brought them with us!! But my uncle (casemt) and busymama's daughter (froghopping) to the rescue, thank goodness for cell phones!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache

~nomad~	Found it	9/16/2006	Went out caching for the afternoon with Fishin Fool and his friend Joe. Found the cache rather quickly.

ajrosie	Found it	9/10/2006	Found the cache and then explored the caves. Not a good cache for those who are afraid of heights (Ms. Daubie). Traded travel bugs.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache
Ms. Daubie	Found it	9/10/2006	I've lived in Oil City all of my life but never made it to Panther's Caves. I really enjoyed this, but my fear of heights kept me from looking over the edge! Ajrosie was much braver than me, though. She acted like a snake and climbed on her belly to the edge! Notice how brave ajrosie looks in the photo; that's the rock she belly climbed.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCXVYE_panthers-cave-cache

This cache is not only going on "and Daughter" and my "FTF" list it will also be on our "Favorites list" as well. Some day I would like to bring Snake Byte and my brother down here to crawl around for awhile. I see also that we only beat Bonnie and Clyde's Gang and BigWags to the FTF by a couple of hours (insert lame victory dance here). We traded a Spiderman wallet for some bubbles. TFTC.

KenGlennR	Found it	8/4/2019	Came up to do the Signature Rock Discovery Tour today and had an incredible experience. Started by going through much of the traditional tour. Before boarding the boat, we were given our gear to put on for the adventure tour. When the boat reached the typical turn around point is where things began to get real fun. We were allowed to get out of the boat, climb over the chains and begin walking towards those damn doors. Tour guides opened the doors to allow us to pass through and continue a more natural cave tour. We waded through water and walked on some slippery mud to many original interesting areas that Lester Howe had established. After our adventure tour, we returned back to the boats where we hitched a ride back with some of the traditional tour boat riders. A really fun afternoon had by all!

cstormg	Found it	7/14/2018	A history making find. I came to the cavern this time for the first ever nude tour, celebrating International Nude Day, June 14th. I am sending CO the answers, and included an edited pic, but could not bring any devices into the cave for obvious reasons. It was a beautiful experience! Find 1357 :) TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache
Edina351	Found it	7/13/2018	Found it :) More later. Answers will be sent soon to CO. Later- this cache has been on my list of "Special Caches" for over 2 years. When planning my ADK vacation, I realized this cache was nearby and added it to my list for the trip. I stayed overnight in nearby Amsterdam Castle, which was one of the most unique and most peaceful stays I've experienced. After leaving the castle (actually a restored armory) this morning, I headed to Howe Caverns, wondering if it would be similar to the Luray Caverns which I visited last year. I arrived and the parking attendant remarked on the kayak in my truck and told me about some great places in the area to kayak! I bought my ticket and waited for the next tour to start, admiring the OCC motorcycle in the waiting area (pretty sure I saw the episode where they built it). Our tour guide was friendly and I told him about the earthcache. He said he'd try to help but it was his 5th day. For his 5th day, he did a phenomenal job. Our group ended up being a small group of 11, with only one small child who was very well behaved. I was thankful to be in this group rather than some of the very large groups we saw of about 25-30 people. I took many photos while gathering the needed info. I really enjoyed the boat ride part of this tour as well as the more confined winding way and the calcium heart. Our tour lasted about 2 hours, as we spent some time waiting for the larger groups ahead to proceed. This gave us a lot of time for exploring and taking pictures, which I enjoyed as it felt much more leisurely and not at all rushed. After the tour, I enjoyed a nice lunch of blackened salmon on ciabatta along with a hot cup of coffee in the cafe. Thanks so much for a great earthcache!

ST.FU	Write note	7/29/2017	I got this Awesome Earthcache coin so i'm Dropping it in all the Earthcaches I found!...Don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The A-Team.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

Harley822	Found it	10/1/2016	We started out with 2 earth caches , Howes Cavern and Secret Cave (Favs), then moved on to grab a quick bite to eat and another cache. We headed out for a state count not a cache count before leaving for home. Vermont was next on out list to be followed by Mass. ( no I will not try to spell it)ending in New Hampshire. We loved caching in the mountains even though we yet another steady rain/drizzle. The valleys and peaks are striking in the yellows and reds and oranges of the early fall color. Too bad we could not be here for the full fall color show. We cached an amazing 10 states in 6 days though we barely scratched the surface of these great states. We have seen oceans, valleys, and mountains and yet we are still amazed at the beauty and serenity of our great country.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

It was so cool literally and we thoroughly enjoyed the tour with our guide Nicole. Josh the boat driver was excellent as well.

Tundra Wolf	Found it	10/28/2015	<b>******************THIS CACHE IS OUR #11,100TH MILESTONE FIND********************</b><p><p>It was a rainy day, but the Wolf Pack of the Southern Tier of NY........including the <i>"little wolves"</i> Jewel & Luna .......was fast approaching our <b>#11,100TH milestone cache.</b> I try to find a special and worthwhile cache for us to do every 100TH cache.......usually dog or wolf themed . I also like virtuals, and in this case I found this Earthcache which is one of the VERY FEW <u>Earthcaches</u> we'd not yet done within probably <u>one hundred miles</u> from the den ! I was going to go this weekend for it, but when I saw several new caches up near Cooperstown (which with a little imagination is SORT OF on the way.....), my first to find lust lead me to haul off and go up today ! Well we got a bit wet and <u>MISSED</u> every dang one of the THREE first to finds we tried for to the local first to find hounds..........but I DID have fun on the cave tour when we met up with our buddy Mrmacman2U and his geodog Meeka ! We also came home with another <b>half dozen</b> smileys and the rain even stopped so I could get a good milestone picture taken with the pack out front !<p><p>I had last taken this tour <b>THIRTY YEARS AGO!</b> It was a trip down memory lane today . So much has not changed at all here (well, the price has TRIPLED since I was here !) It was fun seeing so much I remembered and also noticing a few new things too! We have decided to come back and do the "adventure tour" where you are guided into a part of the cave that has no amenities......like walkways and lights . This gets on the pack's favorite list for sure! The email has been sent, and I will upload the photo shortly. Thanks Monet37 for setting this one up and so giving me a reason to come back here after so many years !!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

Howe cave is now host to both Gemstone mining with Geode cutting and Howe High Adventures; neither of which were around when I was last here. I also learned there was a museum which I had never known before, so made sure to stop and check that out which brought me new insight....So This is were the "original" cave was located and its amazing that with the mining done so close to the cavern that they didn't drill through or "blow" it up!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

Couldn't figure out how to post a pic of myself with my gps because my gps and camera are my cell phone.... I'm posting a pic of my wife in the restaurant on site, and a pic of our feet on the heart in the cave. I hope that is satisfactory. Will email the answers to the questions shortly. Thanks! TFTC!

budget900	Found it	10/11/2014	I made my first trip out here with ska1030 and moxychiq this Columbus Day weekend to enjoy a underground adventure. I have seen pictures of the caverns before but never in person. Obviously, the pictures do not do it justice. Our tour guide was great. He knew the ins and outs about the cave and did not hesitate to answer questions. I really enjoyed the boat ride even though it felt like we were going to tip a few times. The Winding Way was great, even though it was a tight fit in a few spots due to my massive bulk. We added another tour of another awesome spot in NY to our travel resume. Thank you for placing this cache and adding to the days fun by giving us a pop quiz after the tour. Email answers have been sent and I will post pictures soon.

spikep	Found it	5/25/2014	The Maryland Zombie Horde was on their way home for a family thing in Mass. On our way home we decided to stop and do something fun. This earthcache directed us to a great afternoon. The owners gave us one heck of a discount for being veterans and our daughters were excited about the prospect of taking a boat ride underground! Considering how crowded the place was, we didn't have to wait long and we were watching the intro movie and riding the elevator down. We've been to many a cavern before but this one was probably the best of them all and the longest. After our tour, we had a nice lunch, grabbed some items from the gift shop before getting back in the car for the rest of the 7 hour car ride. We got in around midnight and passed out. Thanks for bringing us here and putting in the time to have this one published. E-mail sent with answers.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

Castleraine	Found it	10/11/2013	We are off for a nice little vacation and we spent half of our first day at Howe Cavern. What an AWESOME tour it was. We ended up doing the Lantern Tour, where for the last half of the tour, all the cave lights are turned off, and you are given a candle in a tin can basically, and it was so beautiful to walk through and see it the way Lester Howe first saw it many years ago. Unfortunately you have to be 16 or older to do this tour, but there is always family flashlight Sunday!

City Slicker	Found it	9/22/2010	Out with Dliming & TomTurtle scouring the area today. Stopped in on this one and there was very little to see without paying for the entire tour. The only entry we had access to was only 15 feet deep before we encountered locked doors. There was nothing but hillside limestone to view from our vantage point and lack of access. If it were not for the fact we could anticipate the answers for one of the questions, we would not have been able to answer any of the questions from a first-hand perspective.

myotis	Found it	9/4/2010	Had a nice trip. Been wanting to check this place out. While I do not know why the cache owner is banned, I do not like the caches being active when we cannot contact the owner. I had techinical dificulties getting myself in the picture. If I could have contacted the owner, I would have sent him the answers and explained why I was not able to get a picture with myself in it and asked permision to log it. But I cannot do this. So besides the picture of the entrance, I am also posting a scren shot of my OR 550T. It shows my track there and it shows the picture icon at the dripstone entrance. I have also uploaded a second screenshot that shows my track for Sept 4, 2010 to demostrate I was there on September 4, 2010.

Meanwhile, I'm still on the road for vacation and don't have the pictures available. I'll get them posted in the next week or so. Thanks for the cache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave
G.O. CREW	Found it	7/24/2010	Found with our mom Scrappy T. We had a lot of fun exploring the cave and gem mining. The first one we did had a crying baby during the whole time and that wasn't so fun.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave
Scrappy T	Found it	7/24/2010	As previously stated by others, unable to email answers to owner. We absolutely loved this cave. We did both walking tours, walked to the original entrance location, and the kids did the gem mining. I was also fascinated with the cemetary that is directly above Crystal Palace. The history at all earthcaches makes these type of caches my favorites. Will post pic soon after downloading from my camera. TFTEC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave
Abby the Explorer	Found it	7/21/2010	Solved this one today, and finally uploaded photo to change log to a found it! We really enjoyed the caves! We took both tours and liked the longer one better. We have the answers to the questions, and are willing to e-mail, but we are not able to. Thanks for the fun earthcache!

bryangela	Found it	7/5/2010	My wife and daughters took a day trip down to see these caves and do some caching along the way. We took the longer "Drip Trail" tour first (a great tour) and then did the Crystal Palace tour second (a little anticlimactic feeling after the first one.) We talked about going back down some time and doing a "real" cave expedition some time (on hands/knees with lanterns, gloves, etc.) I did one of those as a teen I have fond memories of doing that. Posting the pictures here but, like a previous finder, don't know how to post the answers; it won't let me email the owner.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave

smileformiles	Found it	2/27/2010	Went caving with a scout group. We did the regular tours plus several additional things to wind up real muddy. This cave has beautiful formations! We also went to the lower cave a quarter mile away and sloshed through water up to our knees. Some of the boys went into "the bathtub" which was up to their chests! Too cold for me to do that.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave
Odyssey Posse	Found it	2/21/2010	Hannah and I stopped by here to do this neat EC today. The sun was out, but the cave was cool and dark. This place is such a treasure! Thanks for the great EC!

bitter/sweet	Found it	2/7/2010	N9TDC & I went on a two-day excursion to Southern Indiana over the weekend of February 6th & 7th. Our destination was Harmonist Labyrinth, which has been a four+ year goal of ours, & marking Posey County & 12 additional counties off of our 2010 caching “to-do” list. As customary, we got sidetracked along the way, but we did manage to find caches in about a half-dozen or so counties. We had such a fantastic journey, which is what geocaching is all about - having an extraordinary time, finding fascinating places & things, learning a little geology, bonding & creating memories. Seeing N9TDC's face light up as he reminisced in Evansville & Vincennes, towns he once called “home,” & listening to him talk to old friends on his ham radio were reasons enough to take the trip - everything else we saw & did was icing on the cake! We went to breakfast at one of N9TDC's favorite spots, the Kat-A-Corner, in Sullivan, Indiana, visited the breathtaking labyrinth in New Harmony, went to an awesome old cemetery & Harmonie State Park, drove by N9TDC's very first apartment, got “glazed,” went to the Casino Aztar (which was, by far, the low point in our trip!), ate dinner at N9TDC's favorite early 1990's hang out, the Nisbet Inn in Haubstadt, Indiana, did a little fossil hunting, took a 70-minute tour of the awesome Marengo Cave (which was, by far, the high point in our trip!), saw a curious chainsaw garden which is featured in the book, Weird Indiana (well deserved) & a limestone kiln & walked a short way along the Knobstone Trail. I am glad I wasn't able to read all of Cav Scout's Marengo Cave description until after our visit, because I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have trekked anywhere in the dark that was the home of cave rats! Thank you so much to all of the cache owners for putting out &/or creating your caches. You gave me the type of weekend that I believe weekends were made for! I apologize for logging all of our cache finds on the 7th! >:( / 0:-)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave
JEEPSTAFF	Found it	1/15/2010	Hey, I cut through the gift shop and said hello as I headed toward the natural entrance..poor Trooper had to wait in the jeep while I got to explore.

Knobhiker	Found it	1/10/2010	I had an amazing opportunity to see ice formations in the cave entrance. The formations were little like normal ice formations. There were flat top stalagmite icicles, very round edged ice flows, and great stalagtite-like icicles from the ceiling. Please check out my photos!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave
go-purdue	Found it	11/8/2009	We decided to visit this cave this weekend, and take our nine year old son, our four year old son, and our 1 and a half year old daughter. We did the Dripstone Trail Tour, and enjoyed it a lot! I was a little difficult to keep the little kids from tripping, falling, and getting scared sometimes, but we did it. I will be sending answers soon for the questions, but will attache a few photographs. Thanks for bringing us here!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1YDDD_marengo-cave
SyGuy&Lyds	Found it	10/16/2009	Wow, what a great cave. We really enjoyed our visit from Columbus Ohio. Took 33 Boy Scouts , Troop 200, and set up camp on the grounds at Marengo Cave. Also visited French Lick for the Train Museum to get our Railroad Merit Badge. Wrapped up the weekend with the new indoor water park in French Lick. Thanks for the Earth Cache. I see your passion!!

Phred312	Found it	2/24/2019	I started the day with the intention of going to the Knobs State Forest. The water was too high to allow access so I had to alter my plans. I have been looking at this series of caches around Buffalo Lake for about 2 years. Evidently today was the day. Never having been here before, I didn't know what to expect but there was a lot of water coming out of the ground. Impressive. Took pictures. Left smiling. Thank you.

coolhipwithit	Found it	2/14/2010	Whooo-Hoooo - my 190th earthcache and 3600 geocache!!! I just needed this one more earthcache for my 190th so we just had to stop and find Cave Spring. I'm not sure where we are, but glad Parzan has 4-wheel drive as this road nearest cache is really not much of a road at all. We make it to the top and it dead ends into someone's house. It is twisty-turny, snowy, muddy and full of pot holes and very skinny to boot . . .like I said, not much of a road at all, but hey cache is only 300 and some feet so we find a place to pull over and off we go. As we are going into trail a man walks by and warns us about the pitt bull dogs that the people in the house let roam. Parzan is pretty uneasy about this so we head down trail quickly. I'm determined to get this one more earthcache. I told him we are allowed to be here, it is a legit trail around Buffalo Lake, but then again we never did see any lake?!?! We go down trail and then take side trail down to creek and come upon Cave Spring. WOW-I wouldof never known this cave was back in here if it wasn't for this earthcache. You never know what your gonna find going after an out-of-the-way earthcache. Thanks for bringing us here today and the information on Cave Spring also . . . this area is rich in history (as is most of Kentucky) . . . I love this state!!! And, earthcaches too!!!

Meow	Found it	12/16/2008	FTF!! on a snowy day. I saw this one pop up - but it was snowy out. Soon I became tired of housework, and Henry wanted to go for walk, and I knew there were new EC's to be found. I figured (correctly) that one I got off my street the road would be OK, so I put on extra socks and snow boots and off we went. Henry was so crazy! He loves the snow! He ran and ran and ran faster! Then he took a few dips in the creek and didn't care at all that he had icicles hanging from his fur. What a nice little cave spring! Henry went in the cave and looked around. Thanks for a nice Earthcache and a pretty walk in the snowy woods today. Meow and Henry	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1JVG5_cave-spring

While we feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other cachers from hiding new geocaches around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Therefore we are archiving this cache so that someone else can place a cache in the area and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

I also changed the terrian level to a 3.5 if anyone else thinks it needs to be lower let me know. I just didn't want anyone to get hurt as it is a hill. Cache is well and still stocked!

calethix	Found it	7/30/2006	That cave was awesome. I'd say I'm mildly claustrophobic and I made it through ok. I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to get out the exit but seeing daylight shine through gave me the incentive I needed. I forgot my good flashlight at home but luckily had a small one I threw in my goodie bag of things to leave at caches. I couldn't believe how cool (literally) it was in the cave. I think it was over 90 and very humid today. I sure missed the cool air of the cave when I got back outside. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave
wrchili	Found it	7/30/2006	I went geocaching today with calethix. He decided to walk through the cave and I walked the trail. We found this cache without much difficulty.

Team Geofrog	Found it	10/19/2018	TaconicNYSParks I found your cache CF7 - Mine Your Step on October 19, 2018 at 9:07:10 AM EDT. This is find# 6587. I went on a 7.7 mile hike in here today. When I started off and for a few hours it was cold. Like in the 30's cold. But once it warmed up it was a beautiful day. At this point it was still cold! I could see where this cache was, and as I was stepping over the trees into the mine, I'm thinking to myself that this isn't the brightest idea I've had, especially since I'm alone. I always worry that the ground isn't really the ground and it's packed leaves and dirt over a hole. I stepped around gingerly, and all is good here. Better to be safe than sorry! The cache is in good shape. Thanks for the cache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7Q9NF_cf7-mine-your-step
bneiman	Found it	9/30/2018	I'm not sure whether the downed trees at the entrance are the result of natural occurrences or were placed there to discourage entrance, so I wasn't sure whether I needed to go in or not. Eventually I squirmed my way through them and made the find. This one finishes the Taconic Challenge caches in Fahnestock for me, but I still need several more to complete the challenge itself. Took Mumu fish #3268 and left a screwdriver. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7Q9NF_cf7-mine-your-step
GoodSamNurse	Found it	9/13/2018	Thanks to TaconicNYSParks for the hike and find. This was my second of todays challenge and last fir today.

Knickknack Hunter	Found it	7/11/2018	Working on the Taconic Region Summer 2018 Challenge. Added four stamps to my passport and picked up a few more smileys along the way. Finding this cache was much easier with the correct coordinates. Two weeks ago I attempted this cache searching in the public section of the Scout Ranch to the south. Spent about 30 minutes before giving up. Today the search lasted about 30 seconds. TNLNSL. Container is in good condition and the contents are dry. Thanks for the hunt.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7Q9NF_cf7-mine-your-step
Walkin' Ed	Found it	7/3/2018	I hoped that by starting out early I would be able to avoid most of the heat. It was a fairly flat walk to the mine and I found it using the corrected coordinates. However the bugs were voracious. The mosquitoes didn't bother me too much but the deer flies wouldn't leave me alone despite the DEET. Thanks for the hide.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7Q9NF_cf7-mine-your-step
RT2K	Found it	6/6/2018	Got an early start to get the 8 qualifying caches I needed to get the Challenge Coin today. Also picking up one more so that I finish on #3,000. I stopped at the office and grabbed a trail map which would prove invaluable. I had wanted to get CF8 and CF9, but read on those cache pages that the nearby parking wasn't available to cachers. After a little back and forth I parked drectly across from the Blue trailhead. I knew the corrected coords were on the trail to CF6, so that would give me the two I needed here to go with the six I would get at FDR. Thanks a lot for the hint and the cache name, as the combo of the two led me right to the cache. There were about 100 mosquitos stuck in spiderwebs right above the cache, I had to be careful not to dislodge and free them as I made the grab. TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7Q9NF_cf7-mine-your-step
Team Mumu	Found it	6/3/2018	If no one else is going to do it, we'll take the FTF! I'm not sure if we've ever hiked the Three Lakes Trail before. I know I've parked at the parking coords, but I don't remember crawling under the guard rail to get to a trail on the other side of the street. It was a wonderful trail to follow and perfectly cool weather was an added bonus. Not quite cool enough to keep away the mozzies, but you can't have everything. I had noted the corrected coords and they took us right to the spot. Signed in and left mumu fish #3268. Cheers, Lynn & John	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7Q9NF_cf7-mine-your-step

SauceMan Games	Archive	9/16/2002	To whom it may concern, I will archive this cache to please the people interested, although I can't believe that so many people have been taking this cache to such an extreme measure. This cache was never intended to offend any single person or group. It was not intended to do anything except give geocachers a wonderful natural area to visit on their travels. I will aslo state that if the NSS would have posted all of their rules at the cave site, none of this would have ever been an issue. From some of the forums I have read, the NSS even stated this site would make a good place for a cache. I'm not saying that we weren't wrong in not asking permission, although if this would have been originally used as a virtual cache site, there would have been no legal grounds for any opposition, since this cave is listed on a publicly viewed website and since there are no rules stated at the site to say otherwise. You can also say that if there have been so many problems at this location, then the NSS should have posted No Trespassing signs on the property. I still believe that Geocachers help protect and clean-up areas such as this, because most of us don't want to see a place like this destroyed any more than the NSS or any other group does. Vandals come in many shapes and sizes and for anyone to specify that geocachers are vandals, this person needs to look within their own group, since many of them are geocachers. On a personal note, I have been inundated with enough e-mail to consider myself a business, so if anybody has problems, please voice them on the forums not through my personal e-mail. I'm not one to hold a grudge, but I will state that since some of the NSS members have attacked us in such an aggressive manner, I'm glad that I was able to retrieve not only my donation check to the NSS for the Tytoona Cave, but also my check to PCC for the T-shirts and bumper stickers that I bought to place in the cache. Anyway, no hard feelings on this side, but I hope my friends in the business & volunteer communities, enjoyed reading the e-mails I've been sending to them. They usually don't like having their friends threatened. Thanks, The Buzzard's	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D4F_tytoona-cave-cache
Team KP	Found it	9/16/2002	Thank you to the Buzzard's for leading us to a natural wonder that we wouldn't have seen if it wouldn't have been for geocaching. We are sorry for the the havoc that the cave committee is causing. We also think that this is ridiculous! We are behind you 100%. What these people are trying to say is that geocachers are thieves and vandals. But, what they don't realize is that we are the biggest advocates of these sites. Geocaching has brought K and myself to many beautiful places, places we would have never seen and experienced. So, thanks to all that particapate in geocaching. We love it and we will do this as long as we live and breathe! Long live geocaching, Team KP	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D4F_tytoona-cave-cache

Salvelinus	Write note	9/15/2002	Caverdoug: I respect your feelings and opinions about this particular cave location. Please spend some time getting to know the geocaching community through this site and particularily the local geocaching community. I'm sure you will find that we could be one of your biggest assets to the conservation and education efforts you speak about concerning this cave. Frankly, since this cave apparently offers public visitation, I hope to visit it next time I'm in the area...regardless of whether a cache exists there or not. Thanks for informing us concerning this particular cache and the Tytoona cave in general. Smoochnme	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D4F_tytoona-cave-cache
shanafme	Write note	9/15/2002	CaverDoug, If that is the case, then please answer me these two questions: 1, If you don't want visitors, why does your organization have this cave listed on a PUBLIC web site (http://www.caves.org/region/mar/tytoona.htm)? The page mentions how to get to the cave, when it is open, what is there, etc... Sounds to me like your group wants people (cavers and non-cavers alike) to experience this natural wonder. 2, Why even open it to the public? Your organization has obviously done a great job conserving the cave and its area and if you are concerned about vandalism, why is the area not marked off as private property? I see your point about being concerned about visitors' safety, but I don't think geocaching is your root problem. Either close the area off from the public and cease advertisement of the area or don't complain when other people learn about the cave.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8D4F_tytoona-cave-cache
caverdoug	Write note	9/15/2002	Cave conservation is not taken lightly in Pennsylvania. In the past, many caves have been vandaled and ruined by careless people who do not know any better. I would like to speak as a member of the caving community in saying that we strive very hard to keep caves in a natural state. Often it requires gating and physically keeping people out. We even limit our own visitation to many caves due to the sensitive nature of the environment (bats or formations, for instance). There are many reasons to be protective of caves and keep people, who do not understand how dangerous some of them are, out. Ironically, the cave in question, is one of the most dangerous caves in the state. It's alluring entrance looks easy and many have explored near the entrance. However, this cave has KILLED! Period. The water flow in the cave is unpredictable and very dangerous besides many other unforeseen dangers. But, that is only one reason to put up wards against thoughtless visitors. Word of mouth spreads quickly and usually gets to the wrong person(s) and this particular cave has been graffitied (sp?) horribly bad in the past. In fact, there have been arrests made at the site for just that. These people find these caves and destroy them. We are not saying that Geocachers are the vandals, rather that the information of it's location could be passed on to a person without care of it's natural beauty and dangers. It is just better that all caves be kept out of the GeoCacheing trend, for the caves and for those who are unaware of the dangers of going to them.

shanafme	Write note	9/14/2002	It's nice to know that there are people in the world like this guy so they can protect the environment from high-crime crimminals like geocachers. Granted, the placers of the cache should have gotten permission first, but threatening to involve police is ridicoulous without first contacting the original placers of the cache.

Quest Master	Needs Archived	9/13/2002	I received the following email from the manager of the Tytoona Cave Preserve. I thought I had better pass it along to you and geocaching.com: Hello Tytoona Committee and others concerned: It was brought to my attention that Tytoona Cave is now listed on the Geo Cache website and apparently someone has placed an item in the cave for all the geo cacher's to find. If you're not sure what Geo Cache is, it is where people with GPS units go and hide items in different locations across the United States. Then clues, coordinates and even maps are presented on the web to make the search easy for everyone to find. While it may seem to be a harmless way to enjoy the outdoors with some fun, it also creates problems for others trying to protect sensitive sites. I don't have to tell you that Tytoona has suffered vandal problems in the past and I think we have been doing a good job of protecting Tytoona through property inspections and having the State Police make arrests when needed. This new information of Tytoona being on the Geo Cache really disturbs me! Whoever went in the cave and placed the items then publicized it on the web, did so illegally and with out any permission what so ever. This will also make it easier for vandals to find and locate the cave now. I also feel that Geo Caching in caves is a hobby that exploits caves and has nothing to do with any conservation practices or particular cave interest. The bad consequences to the cave of someone entering and trashing it in the attempt to find a hidden item through Geo Cache is very high and is not only unacceptable but illegal. Tytoona is not only protected as private property through management, it is also protected by the laws of Pennsylvania (Pa. Cave Law). I also believe that the NSS have commented about Geo Caches in the past and that they forbid any Geo cache in NSS owned caves. Therefore, I will make a trip to Tytoona and see if this Geo Cache exists. If it is found, I will remove it as evidence and possibly have the State Police investigate as to prosecution. Right now, I'd say the items can be considered at littering in the cave and I'm sure other laws may have been broken. I welcome any help from the Tytoona Committee in contacting the Geo Cache website, to ask that they remove Tytoona from any listing and that they tell their membership not to use the Tytoona Cave Preserve for Geo Cache purposes. I hope that they will accommodate our request with out any further action needed, especially since they have done well so far at incriminating themselves. You can see the Tytoona Geo Cache website at http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.asp?ID=36175 If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to ask.

Mongo	Temporarily Disable Listing	11/13/2012	[b][u][red]OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED[/b][/u][/red] Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last several logs on this cache it appears that this cache is in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the [red][b]”NEEDS MAINTENANCE”[/b][/red] attribute is showing you will need to do the following. http://tinyurl.com/y8n7vuy Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and will be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. Thanks for your understanding, Many thanks, Mongo Groundspeak Reviewer	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

kbh3rd	Write note	5/9/2010	I wasn't planning on going to Potosi today, so I didn't look up this cache before leaving. But when I found myself there I recalled your wonderful short history of Potosi & Moses Austin, which I greatly enjoyed. So I kept my eye out and spotted what I thought must be the tomb while driving along Highway 8 in the middle of town. So we circled around and found it. Not just the Austins' tomb but the whole cemetery & adjoining 178-y.o. church are a treat for history buffs. I didn't look for the cache, but thanks for sending me that way. I put a picture of the tomb in Moses Austin's article on Wikipedia.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

Phred312	Found it	9/29/2013	I needed to find an Earthcache in September and the one at the cave is the closest opportunity. I have been through the valley probably a dozen times and I have seen others find this cache but I have never logged it until today. Took pictures. Left signature. Thank you.
