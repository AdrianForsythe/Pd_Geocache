GC7A36D,46.77425,-89.08192,Type.earthcache,adventure mine history the adventure mine operated from 1850 to 1920 and is one of the best preserved mine sites of its age the adventure mine was opened on existing prehistoric excavations located on adventure bluff these prehistoric workings date to about 5000 years ago and were very extensive the mine consisted of five shafts four were inclined at 45 degrees to follow the ore body and one was vertical the deepest of these shafts the no 3 contained 13 levels and extended down 1300 feet following the ore body the adventure mine was incorporated several different times trying to develop a profitable mine on adventure bluff although the adventure mine always showed great promise and millions of dollars were spent pursuing that dream the mine always won out in the end it never produced a profit local geology this area was covered by hundreds of large lava flows approximately 11 billion years ago when lava erupts gasses which had been trapped in the lava bubble to the surface and create a frothy layer similar to a can of soda when opened the lava cooled and formed bedrock with a solid bottom part and a porous top part similar to a sponge in appearance each subsequent lava flow buried the previous one creating a layered effect solid basalt the grayish color rock in the area porous basalt solid basalt the porous basalt and so on the eruptions occurred for an approximately 2 million year long time span the basalt lava flows covered an area from the keweenaw peninsula to isle royale as the basalt lava continued erupting after it ceased parts of the area were covered by reddish colored conglomerates rhyolite these conglomerates were then covered by the reddish sandstone common to this area later to be know as jacobsville sandstone these deposits occurred roughly 1 billion years ago the stack of lava flows or basalt conglomerates and sandstones layers of bedrock was then compressed from the sides due to tremendous pressures caused by the moving of earths crust plate tectonics the bedrock layers began to bend from the pressure and changed from basically flat lying to bowl shaped picture taking a thick book and pressing on it from the ends originally the pages are flat and straight but push hard enough and the book will begin to bend into a u shape one end of the u became the keweenaw peninsula the other end isle royale and the space in the middle the inside of the u is lake superior glaciers have eroded away the bedrock unevenly so the layers at the surface are not quite as obvious as they were when formed glaciers have also carved out most of the land features including adventure mountain but in most places you still find sandstones and conglomerates along the lake shore and basalt further away from the lake the copper the copper here was deposited after the lava eruptions were finished and after the formations of the conglomerates and sandstones basically the copper precipitated out of warm ground water hydrothermal solutions many people that have well water get iron or rust stains in their sinks from dripping water this iron precipitates from their well water and deposits itself onto their sink the copper in the bedrock formed the same way given enough time large quantities of copper were deposited by filling voids in the bedrock where the water was flowing through now to put this all together if water is flowing through bedrock there must be cracks and porous sections of rock that allow this to occur the copper was deposited only in the top porous sections of the basalt lava flows this is how we came to have parallel lodes of copper in the adventure mine the copper occurs only in the lava flow top sections so only those areas were ever mined the solid part of the basalt lava has no copper as discussed before the bedrock layers were bent from pressure and this is why the lodes at the adventure mine are inclined at 45 degrees if you walk in the mine and see some of the larger stopes areas of copper lodes that have been mined away and are now open they are all inclined upward at approximately a 45 degree incline the conglomerates had areas of rich copper deposits where copper had filled in areas between the stones and cobbles there were also some shales that had enough open space to allow copper deposits mostly in the cracks and fissures in the rocks most of the very large masses of native copper mined were formed as the result of a copper filled fissure native copper all the copper mined here occurs in metallic natural native form it is not chemically combined with any other minerals this is very rare the only other place in the world where native copper occurs in quantities significant enough to mine is in coro coro bolivia in south america the keweenaw is the only place in the world where copper occurs in natural pieces weighing more than a few pounds the largest piece mined from the adventure mine weighed approximately 24 tons most of all the copper mined elsewhere today occurs in oxidized copper deposits containing little or no metallic copper these oxidized deposits must be treated by various chemical processes to yield metallic copper mine terms stopes stopes are large underground rooms from which ore is removed they are formed when miners drill numerous holes into the rock wall called the working face these holes are then loaded with explosives and detonated the blast breaks the working face and rock into pieces small enough to be loaded into mine cars and carried from the mine shaft a vertical or sloping passageway

GC3QB8X,45.6053,-65.53818,Type.earthcache,well it seems that silica is also mined in poodiac new brunswick close to cassidy lake this large silica mine is strategically located close to main highways to make it easily accessible to all of eastern north america generally there are four categories of silica deposits cretaceous quartzose sand and gravel late carboniferous quartzose sandstone and quartzpebble conglomeration neoproterozoicsilurian quartzite and quartz veins a small outcrop of quartz silica sand has been recognized at vinegar hill near cassidy lake south of sussex new brunswick since the 1980s and extracted for commercial purposes the deposit lies over carboniferous rocks and under glacial deposits its setting is very similar to comparable confirmed cretaceous deposits in nova scotia the silicarich deposit at cassidy lake is made up of quartzose sand and quartzpebble to quartzcobble sized gravel other cretaceous sand and gravel deposits similar to those at cassidy lake have yet to be located in new brunswcik however deposits may exist in structurally similar settings including the area immediately south of the harveyhopewell fault in southeastern new brunswick given the economic and scientific interest of the vinegar hill deposit a search for similar outcrops would be worthwhile although silica mining has been explored in various areas of new brunswick including bass river near belldune the burchill road quartzite deposit southwest of saint john and white head and nantucket islands in southwestern new brunswick the cassidy lake deposit near sussex is new brunswicks most productive and longstanding silica operation the silica was first noted in the late 1970s when a potash exploration drillhole intersected 150 m of white quartzose material when the silica unit was drilltested and analyzed results indicated a reserve of 167 mt of highgrade 9899 sio in the form of poorly consolidated cretaceous sand and gravel the cassidy lake operation started production in 1986 under what became sussex silica inc and a processing plant was erected on site atlantic silica inc acquired the sussex silica assets in 1993 and currently manages the quarry and facilities nova scotiabased interests took ownership of atlantic silica in early 2003 the head office of the company is in enfield nova scotia and the mine is located at poodiac near cassidy lake new brunswick the mine employing nine persons operates on a fulltime basis for eight months of the year and relies on its stored inventory for the remaining winter months silica resources at cassidy lake comprise about 20 mt of material averaging >99 sio the processing plant sells its silica products across eastern canada and the northeastern united states end uses of the sand and pebblesized materials include silicon metal silicon carbide glass recreational sand decorative stone filtration sand foundry sand refractory sand smelter flux cement additive landscaping material and construction sand the company operates a washing screening and drying plant on the mine site which has a capacity of 140 metric tonnes per hour products required to be dry are processed and packaged at a rate of 30 to 50 tonnes per hour the silica deposit covered by one to twelve metres of overburden is a 98 percent pure unconsolidated natural deposit of sand and gravel quartz the deposit is approximately 1500 metres long by 600 metres wide the material is consistent with depth to the extent of 16 metre drill holes the depth of the deposit is unknown proven reserves are 18 million tonnes probable reserves are 50 million tonnes to 32 metres depth and 100 million tonnes to 65 metres ore depth the plant was originally developed to supply the quebec and northern new brunswick markets for silicon metal silicon carbide and metallurgical flux in 1989 a successful pilot test was conducted to prove the material was suitable for glass products both container and flat glass the company still hopes to become a regular supplier of glass sand since inception asi has increasingly become a supplier of a wide variety of sand products including blasting sands nursery grits golf course sand both bunker and green drainage filtration media foundry sand refractory sand cement additives concrete aggregate traction sand for roads railways and airports plaster sand and decorative sands including pebbles these products are shipped to a wide variety of locations throughout eastern canada and northeastern usa all current shipping is by road transport which services the mine site cn rail is located within 5 km of the plant and the deep water port of saint john new brunswick open year round is located 40 km away the posted coordinates take you to an area where you can easily see the mine remember

GC1GCX8,45.5589,-65.57518,Type.earthcache,the history of potash in new brunswick the element potassium k is essential to plant and animal life without potassium leaves will wither muscles grow weak and the nervous system convulses potash is marketed primarily as fertilizer small quantities are also sold to the pulp and paper industry and to makers of soaps detergents glass drugs and furnace fluxes a primary source of potassium is the mineral sylvite kcl which often occurs as an intergrowth with another mineral halite salt or nacl the mixture is known as potash or sylvinite the higher the mixture of sylvinite content the higher the grade of potash ore potash was formed during the mississippian age during that time much of what is now southeast new brunswick possessed a hot and arid climate and lay beneath an extensive shallow sea the seawater slowly evaporated over time causing potassium and other salts to precipitate from the brine much like a salt solution is left on a plate when the liquid dries after the ocean receded thick layers of other sediments buried the potash and related deposits where they remained undisturbed for 325 million years salt deposits were first discovered in the sussex area in the early 1800s when area residents tapped local salt springs dried the brine to produce halite which they used in food preservation in 1971 government geologists drilled two holes east of sussex hoping to discover commercial salt deposits they discovered salt and thick beds of potash potash was discovered in large quantities in the area surrounding sussex with the deposit being the second largest in the world after an area in saskatchewan two mines were built near the town one in penobsquis 8 km east and another at cassidy lake 10 km southeast cn rail built trackage to serve both mines which employed hundreds from the surrounding area in the 1900s new brunswick had two worldclass potash mining and processing facilities namely the potash corporation of saskatchewan incs new brunswick division and cassidy lake division until recently the cassidy lake division mined and provided the company with custom and selected valueadded processing the new brunswick division at penobsquis functions as an integrated minemill facility in 2002 exploratory drilling southeast of the mine has resulted in the discovery of additional and potentially significant potash reserves the expansion is expected to more than double the annual potash production potash is mined underground at a depth of between 400 to 700 meters machines known as roadheaders are used to remove potash ore underground these huge mining machines have a rotary cutting head mounted on a boom and can excavate 300 to 500 tonnes of potash ore per hour they crawl forward along a working face slowly swinging the boom up and down and back and forth the machine excavates potash ore in the front and gathers it onto a conveyor belt at the rear pcs mills its ore into four commercial grades granular coarse standard and fine the processed potash is loaded onto railcars and carried by train to storage facilities in saint john from there it is shipped to western europe the united sates central and south america asia and oceania rock salt is also mined and is used for road salt approximately half of the production stays in new brunswick while the rest is shipped through the us northeast typically underground potash deposits are overlain by water bearing formations that pose considerable threat to the ongoing operation of potash mines there have been a number of potash mine floods over the past 30 years including new brunswick beginning about 1997 the sussex potash mine began experiencing a brine inflow problem that has increased every year peaking last year at about 1800 gpm us gallons per minute grouting efforts into the inflow zone along with sustained drilling and grouting efforts underground have sealed at least some of the flow paths and have helped to stem the flow of brine into the mine but at this time the source of the water has not been determined the cassidy lake division potash was mined to the south east of cassidy lake the mine was opened by dennison and was later purchased by the potash company of canada limiteds potacan mining co property in the late 1900s areas of the mine began to flood shortly after it was allowed to flood completely and production was terminated in 1998 potash corporation of saskatchewan inc purchased the properties in new brunswick a flooded mine and a functioning mill the flooded mine was renamed cassidy lake division of pcs at the time of closure the annual capacity of the mine was 13 million tonnes today the mine acts as water storage for its sister operation in penobsquis currently a small group of employees manage the companys brine pipeline to the bay of fundy approximately 300 350 tanker trucks haul brine from the sussex mine daily most of these tanker trucks haul the brine to the cassidy lake division the brine hauled to cassidy lake is a slurry of potash in brine the slurry is deposited into holding lagoons where the brine is taken off and pumped via the brine pipeline to be deposited into the bay of fundy in the area of giffins pond just south of st martins the remaining tanker trucks haul brine to the companys potash terminal in saint john for disposal into the bay the community continues to be concerned about the transport of brine from the new brunswick production site to the cassidy lake site for disposal especially with truck safety and speed and the company is addressing these concerns recently a 30km brine pipeline was built to ship excess brine from the penobsquis mine site to the companys brine pond at cassidy lake and into the bay of fundy this has lowered the daily volume of brine hauled away to less than half the 2008 volume in 2015 the cassidy lake mine building was demolished in 2016 the potash mines in penobsquis were closed as well

water you will see a doorway that maybe closed towards the back of the cave outside of that door is a waterfall which you can see by exiting the building and walking outside of the cave this waterfall is responsible for helping in the creation of the cave the geology of the great lakes area is not very suitable for the development of caves when the ice from ice age covered the area any existing caves are thought to have been destroyed from the weight of the ice formation of caves during that time was not possible after the ice retreated water started to dissolve the surrounding limestone and began forming the tufa rock tufa is the name for unusual geological form of calcite rock tufa rock leaves spaces grows irregular and sometimes encloses gaps to form caves this is an example of that process bear cave is a very interesting cave because there are very few existing caves in this part of michigan bear cave is a natural cave which simply means it is a hollow or natural passage under or into the earth it is not a rather common karst karst is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite cave but a much rarer tufa a secondary limestone cave a primary cave which was formed together with the surrounding rock this bed is estimated by geologists to be at least 25000 years old and rests on a glacial drift deposited during the last ice age 50000 years ago in the cave near the bottom of the staircase is a boulder kansan boulder believed to be several hundred thousand years old that was moved to

part that does not receive daylight however in popular usage the term includes smaller spaces like sea caves rock shelters and grottos caves are formed by geologic processes these may involve a combination of chemical processes erosion from water tectonic forces microorganisms pressure and atmospheric influences most caves are formed in limestone by dissolution solutional caves may form anywhere with rock that is soluble and are most prevalent in limestone but can also form in other material including chalk dolomite marble granite salt sandstone fossilized coral and gypsum the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with h2co3 carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes sinking streams and underground drainage limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation this include flowstones stalactites stalagmites helictites draperies soda straws and columns these secondary mineral deposits in caves are called speleothems the worlds most spectacularly decorated cave is generally regarded to be lechuguilla cave new mexico usa lechuguilla and nearby carlsbad caverns are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave they were formed by h2s hydrogen sulfide gas rising from below where reservoirs of oil give off sulfurous fumes this gas mixes with ground water and forms h2so4 sulfuric acid the acid then dissolves the limestone from below rather than from above by acidic water percolating from the surface some caves are formed at the same time as the surrounding rock these are sometimes called primary caves lava tubes are formed through volcanic activity and are the most common primary caves the lava flows downhill and the surface cools and solidifies the hotter lava continues to flow under that crust and if most of the liquid lava beneath the crust flows out a hollow tube remains thus forming a cavity examples of such caves can be found on tenerife big island and many other places kazumura cave near hilo is a remarkably long and deep lava tube it is 656 kilometers 408 mi long sea caves are found along coasts around the world a special case is littoral caves which are formed by wave action in zones of weakness in sea cliffs often these weaknesses are faults but they may also be dykes or beddingplane contacts some wavecut caves are now above sea level because of later uplift elsewhere in places such as thailands phang nga bay solutional caves have been flooded by the sea and are now subject to littoral erosion sea caves are generally around 5 meters 16 ft to 50 meters 160 ft in length but may exceed 300 meters 980 ft glacier caves occur in ice and under glaciers formed by melting they are also influenced by the very slow flow of the ice which tends to close the caves again these are sometimes called ice caves though this term is properly reserved for caves that contain yearround ice formations fracture caves are formed when layers of more soluble minerals such as gypsum dissolve out from between layers of less soluble rock these rocks fracture and collapse in blocks talus caves are the openings between rocks that have fallen down into a pile often at the bases of cliffs anchihaline caves are caves usually coastal containing a mixture of freshwater and saline water usually sea water they occur in many parts of the world and often contain highly specialized and endemic faunas branchwork caves resemble surface dentritic stream patterns they are made up of passages that join downstream as tributaries branchwork caves are the most common of cave patterns and are formed near sinkholes where groundwater recharge occurs each passage or branch is fed by a separate recharge source and converges into other higher order branches downstream angular network caves form from intersecting fissures of carbonate rock that have had fractures widened by chemical erosion these fractures form high narrow straight passages that persist in widespread closed loops anastomotic caves largely resemble surface braided streams with their passages separating and then meeting further down drainage they usually form along one bed or structure and only rarely cross into upper or lower beds spongework caves are formed as solution cavities are joined by mixing of chemically diverse water the cavities form a pattern that is threedimensional and random resembling a sponge ramiform caves form as irregular large rooms galleries and passages these randomized threedimensional rooms form from a rising water table that erodes the carbonate rock with hydrogensulfide enriched water caves are found throughout the world but only a portion of them have been explored and documented by cavers the distribution of documented cave systems is widely skewed toward countries where caving has been popular for many years such as france italy australia the uk the united states etc as a result explored caves are found widely in europe asia north america and oceania but are sparse in south america africa and antarctica this is a great generalization as large expanses of north america and asia contain no documented caves whereas areas such as the madagascar dry deciduous forests and parts of brazil contain many documented caves as the worlds expanses of soluble bedrock are researched by cavers the distribution of documented caves is likely to shift for example china despite containing around half the worlds exposed limestone more than 1000000 square kilometers 390000 sq mi has relatively few documented caves this cave has been made by water and wind causing the limestone rock and dirt under the rock to erode away to form a big cave a big cave big enough for a lot of animals or even people to hide and seek shelter in this cave i would consider this cave as this type of cave ramiform caves form as irregular large rooms galleries and passages these randomized threedimensional rooms form from a rising water table

GC1YTWX,38.35513,-83.11172,Type.earthcache,one of the most popular caves for visitors in the carter cave system is cascade cave the walls of the cavern have been carved by water cascade cave is filled with beautiful and strange forms stalactites and stalagmites are found along the right passage of the cave columns draperies and flowstone created by centuries of water percolating through earth and stone decorate portions of the cavern in 1959 cascade cave once privately owned and operated became a part of the carter cave state park system shown to visitors since 1925 the cavern is made up a series of parallel passages they are filled with dripstone formations of different types the entrance to cascade cave is located on the side of one of the many sinkholes in the area highlights of the cavern include counterfeiters room named for the supposed use of the cave by counterfeiters the lake room socalled for the large pool of water located there other interesting points in and around cascade cave are cathedral room the hanging gardens of king solomon cardross castle ice capped mountains and temple bells cascade cave also has a beautiful 30 foot underground waterfall it took hundreds of thousands maybe millions of years for nature to create the intricate formations inside the caves of carter county in eastern kentucky and those shapes and patterns are fantastic in cascade cave the largest and most beautiful underground structure in carter caves state resort park you walk through one cavern after another marveling at limestone deposits that have come to look like anything from faces to animals to giant birthday cakes dripping with elaborate layers of icing in the middle of one huge chamber is a reflecting pool brightening the subterranean gloom with a splash of color from the trees and sky reflected through a natural skylight as i was inside cascade cave on a sunday afternoon a park guide leading the way i took in the sites of what the cave had to offer while inside the cave it dawned on me that the scene could have been lifted from the lord of the rings a perfect recreation of one of gollums caves i walked across a damp stone bridge that resembled part of the mines of moria also straight out of jrr tolkiens writings the veteran cave guide called a remarkable space inside cascade cave the dragons chamber water dripping through limestone has formed a dragons head on the ceiling mouth gaping open and ready to pounce on its prey at floor level below the beasts body and tail support the head and 20foot wings spread to each side the tour ended with a short hike above ground to a separate part of cascade cave and a look at an underground waterfall the passageway to the falls is steep and narrow and almost requires visitors to walk singlefile to view the long thin stream of water cascading 30 feet into the darkness of an invisible pool inside the cave you will find many more types of cave formations created by time cave formations soda straws soda straw stalactites are thinwalled hollow tubes about a quarter inch in diameter they form as water runs through their centers and deposits rings of calcite around the tips of the formations stalactites grow down from the ceiling and form as mineral layers are deposited by water flowing over the outside of the soda straws they form after the centers of the hollow soda straws become plugged stalagmites grow up from the floor where mineral laden water drips from above stalagmites stalagmites are often but not always found beneath stalactites they have flat or rounded tops as compared to the carrot shaped stalactites columns columns are formed when stalactites and stalagmites grow together or when one of them grows all the way to the floor or ceiling cave coral grapes cave coral or popcorn is irregular clusters or rough knobs of crystalline calcium carbonate they build up on walls and existing formations as mineralladen water seeps through the pores of the rocks draperies cave bacon draperies form where drops of mineralladen water trickle down the undersides of inclined ceilings leaving deposits in lines which fold and curl as if they were drapes of curtains flowstone forms where films of water flow over walls floors and formations depositing sheets of calcium carbonate like icing another interesting fact about cascade cave and many other caves in the park is that its home to thousands of bats i could see bats hanging inside the cave as i walked about looking at the beauty the cave offered me to see the bats seemed to be unaffected by the visitors in its home bats are not as dangerous as once believed i can remember as a child the stories told by adults that bats are attracted to blonde hair and attacked people just to be mean bats are actually harmless and keep the local insect population in check bats do sometimes carry rabies the only way you could get rabies from a bat is to handle a bat leave them alone and they will leave you alone carter caves state resort park covers 2000 acres of rolling hills a manmade lake eight hiking trails that meander through high cliffs deep gorges natural bridges and hardwood forests and dozens of caves although only a handful are open to the public cascade cave is open yearround and requires no special clothing or equipment to visit there are other caves to visit in the park however you must check in with the visitor center to find out the park regulations before caving the only way to enter the cave is by signing up for the cascade cave tour at the visitor center entering the cave any other way would be trespassing and punishable by law alert a disorder known as whitenose syndrome has been found in caves in the eastern united states and is killing hundreds of thousands of bats

sit about in the shade of the trees that guard it this magnificent fan is capable of cooling everybody in town at once within 50 years of muirs visit horse cave had become one of americas most notorious examples of groundwater pollution in the 1920s and 30s raw sewage thick with spoiled whey from a local creamery was piped directly into the underground stream the magnificent fan spread the stench for miles making the town virtually uninhabitable every summer for 6 decades chromium and other chemicals from a metalplating factory further polluted the abundance of cold water in 1987 after nearly 50 years of closure the american cave conservation association acca located its national headquarters on the hidden river cave grounds and began efforts to restore and reopen the cave as the

formation of limestone and caverns many years ago the earth was covered with shallow oceans in these oceans were strange forms of life that used the lime from the sea water to form their shell homes as they died they settled to rest on the ocean floor their shells grew deeper and deeper at the bottom of the ocean under the pressure of the ocean water the shells were pressed down into rock we now call limestone when the continents collided the force of the collision uplifted the limestone to form the appalachian mountains the land was pelted by torrential rain and this water flowed through the cracks and crevices slowly widening them into the rooms and passageways we walk through today the process stopped when the water table lowered and air enttered the cavern this condition allowed rain water to seep down through the soil and limestone as it still does today carrying with it a mineral called calcium carbonate lime when this mineral hits the air in the cavern it crystallizes forming speleothems commonly called cave formations these crystals are known as calcium crystals speleothems form at varying rates depending upon the amount of water entering the caverns and the temperature of the outside air on an average it takes 120 years for a cubic inch to form speleothems speleothems take various forms depending on whether the water drips seeps condenses flows or ponds dripstone is calcium carbonate in the form of stalactites or stalagmites stalactites are pointed pendants hanging from the cave ceiling from which they grow soda straws are very thin but long stalactites having an elongated cylindrical shape rather than the usual more conical shape of stalactites helictites are stalactites that have a central canal with twiglike or spiral projections that appear to defy gravity chandeliers are complex clusters of ceiling decorations stalagmites are the groundup counterparts of stalactites often seen as blunt mounds broomstick stalagmites are very tall and spindly totem pole stalagmites are also tall and shaped like their namesakes columns result when stalactites and stalagmites meet or when stalactites reach the floor of the cave flowstone is sheetlike and found on cave

on june 25 1931 it was opened to the public as hiwaymay caverns when myron dunlavy sr found out about the availability of hiwaymay caverns he entered into a fiveyear leasepurchase agreement from 1932 until 1937 the name was william penn caverns after purchasing the business myron sr decided to honor the president he most admired changing the name to lincoln caverns myron dunlavy jr came to huntingdon as a teenager to work at lincoln caverns and attend juniata college in huntingdon like his father he was an avid caver and spent much of his spare time digging in sinkholes atop warrior ridge looking for other caves on the property in september of 1941 he discovered whisper rocks in 1972 myron jrs daughter ann dunlavy returned to huntingdon and worked at the cave as a guide while attending juniata college in 1977 she returned to huntingdon to become manager and caretaker of lincoln caverns the operation of the caverns has remained a family affair with anns mother marion dunlavy serving as secretarytreasurer and myron serving as president until the time of his death in december 2005 when touring a solutional cave one formed below the water table you are actually inside the groundwater system lincoln tunnel lincoln tunnel was blasted in 1984 to eliminate crossing route 22 to enter the cave the gray rock you see around the entrance is actually gunnite sprayed concrete used to stabilize the rocks following the blasting mystery room mr dunlavy drove a pipe through the bank of laterite cave clay and discovered two unusual things there were several live bats hanging from the ceiling with no apparent way for the bats to have entered several speleothems on the ceiling were broken and the peices were nowhere to be found neither of these mysteries have been

in the surface topography caused by the removal of soil or bedrock often both by water sinkholes may vary in size from less than a meter to several hundred meters both in diameter and depth and vary in form from soillined bowls to bedrockedged chasms they may be formed gradually or suddenly and are found worldwide sinkholes are usually but not always linked with karst landscapes in such regions there may be hundreds or even thousands of sinkholes in a small area so that the surface as seen from the air looks pockmarked and there are no surface streams because all drainage occurs subsurface sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone carbonate rock salt beds or rocks that can naturally be dissolved by ground water circulating through them as the rock dissolves spaces and caverns develop underground sinkholes are dramatic because the land usually stays intact for a while until the underground spaces just get too big if there is not enough support for the land above the spaces then a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur karst topography karst topography is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite due to subterranean drainage there may be very limited surface water even to the absence of all rivers and lakes many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes or dolines being the most common however distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by glacial debris or confined by a superimposed nonsoluble rock strata some karst regions include thousands of caves even though evidence of caves that are big enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst karst landforms are generally the result of mildly acidic water acting on soluble bedrock such as limestone or dolostone the carbonic acid that causes these features is formed as rain passes through the atmosphere picking up co2 which dissolves in the water once the rain reaches the ground it may pass through soil that may provide further co2 to form a weak carbonic acid solution h2o + co2 = h2co3 recent studies of sulfates in karst waters suggests sulfuric and hydrosulfuric acids may also play an important role in karst formation this mildly acidic water begins to dissolve the surface and any fractures or bedding planes in the limestone bedrock over time these fractures enlarge as the bedrock continues to dissolve openings in the rock increase in size and an underground drainage system begins to develop allowing more water to pass through and accelerating the formation of underground karst features somewhat less common than this limestone karst is gypsum karst where the solubility of the mineral gypsum provides many similar structures to the dissolution and redeposition of calcium carbonate the karstification of a landscape may result in a variety of large or small scale features both on the surface and beneath on exposed surfaces small features may include flutes runnels clints and grikes collectively called karren or lapiez mediumsized surface features may include sinkholes or dolines closed basins vertical shafts foibe inverted funnel shaped sinkholes disappearing streams and reappearing springs largescale features may include limestone pavements poljes and blind valleys mature karst landscapes where more bedrock has been removed than remains may result in karst towers or haystackeggbox landscapes beneath the surface complex underground drainage systems such as karst aquifers and extensive caves and cavern systems may form classification of caves caves are classified a by the rocks they are in b by the morphology of the cave c by the time they were formed d by the way they were formed and e by the age of the rock 1 by the rocks they are in a limestone caves limestone dolomite marble b gypsum caves c lava caves 2 by the morphology of the cave the geometric structure a horizontal caves consist of some nearly horizontal tubes b fissure caves consist of a single fissure in the rock c vertical caves consist of shafts and short links in between d cave systems are rather large and contain many different features the discrimination in horizontal and vertical caves is useful only in areas with rather small caves these caves consist normally of a single tunnel or shaft in other karst areas with larger caves any cave is a cave system 3 by the time they were formed in relation to the forming of the rocks they are in a primary caves formed together with the surrounding rocks these are typically lava tubes or gas bubbles or tufa caves b most caves are secondary caves after the formation of the rock there is a time when part of the rocks are removed this secondary stage formed the cave c tertiary caves are the result of the collapse of other caves 4 by the way they were formed a solutional caves or karst caves most caves are in rocks which can be dissolved by a weak natural acid usually carbonic acid this acid forms when rainwater absorbs co2 from the air and the upper layers of the soil the forming of gypsum caves does not require co2 because gypsum has a very high solubility b lava caves or lava tubes first a crust hardens on a lava flow when the crust gets thick enough the lava flow is underground when the eruption ends the lava keeps flowing and the empty tunnellike passage remains the length of this tube depends on the distance from the lava source to the drain a depression or the sea it can be hundreds or even thousands of meters long c tufa caves are formed when limestone rich water emerges from a spring d sea caves are created by the erosion of waves the waves force water into cracks in the rock breaking the rock and forming caves often these caves follow less resistant rock layers e talus caves huge rockfalls from cliffs can create large spacious chambers within the resulting boulder piles f earthquake caves are formed by the movement of rock along a fault its just a natural crack in the rock and the big ones are very rare g glacier caves are created from water moving through glaciers these caves are formed inside the ice ice caves are filled with ice but the cave itself is formed in rock most ice caves are formed as solutional caves in limestone h soil tubes in desert areas flash floods can move through the soil and hollow out openings 5 by the age of the rock this is useful for limestone caves limestone is a sedimentary rock and is characterized by the time it was formed the most common limestone formations are a recent limestone or tufa is found all over the world b jurassic limestone c devonian limestone whisper rocks for hours and admission

types and caused by widely differing geological processes caves range in size from single small rooms to interconnecting passages many miles long the scientific study of caves is called speleology from the greek words spelaion for cave and logos for study it is a composite science based on geology hydrology biology and archaeology and thus holds special interest for earth scientists of the us geological survey caves have been natural attractions since prehistoric times prolific evidence of early mans interest has been discovered in caves scattered throughout the world fragments of skeletons of some of the earliest manlike creatures australopithecines have been discovered in cave deposits in south africa and the first evidence of primitive neanderthal man was found in a cave in the neander valley of germany cromagnon man created his remarkable murals on the walls of caves in southern france and northern spain where he took refuge more than 1o000 years ago during the chill of the ice age interest in caves has not dwindled although firm figures for cave visitors are not available in 1974 about 15 million people toured mammoth cave in kentucky and more than 67o000 visited carlsbad caverns in new mexico two of the most famous caves in the united states types of caves a simple classification of caves includes four main types and several other relatively less important types solution caves are formed in carbonate and sulfate rocks such as limestone dolomite marble and gypsum by the action of slowly moving ground water that dissolves the rock to form tunnels irregular passages and even large caverns along joints and bedding planes most of the caves in the worldas well as the largestare of this type lava caves are tunnels or tubes in lava formed when the outer surface of a lava flow cools and hardens while the molten lava within continues to flow and eventually drains out through the newly formed tube sea caves are formed by the constant action of waves which attacks the weaker portions of rocks lining the shores of oceans and large lakes such caves testify to the enormous pressures exerted by waves and to the corrosive power of wavecarried sand and gravel glacier caves are formed by melt water which excavates drainage tunnels through the ice of entirely different origin and not to be included in the category of glacier caves are socalled ice caves which usually are either solution caves or lava caves within which ice forms and persists through all or most of the year in desert areas some shallow caves may be formed by the sandblasting effect of silt or fine sand being blown against a rock face these eolian caves some of which are spectacular in size are surpassed in number by caves of other origins in most deserts more common even in the driest deserts are sandstone caves eroded in part by water particularly if the sandstone is limy caves commonly known as wind caves such as the one in wind cave national park in south dakota are named not for the mode of origin of the cave but for the strong air currents that alternately blow in or out of the cave as the atmospheric pressure changes most wind caves are in fact solution caves how caves form the meltwater streams draining out along the floor of a glacier cave or the surging pounding waves at the mouth of a sea cave offer immediate evidence of the origin of these caves solution caves however have always been a source of wonder to man how do these extensive complex and in some places beautifully decorated passageways develop solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water they can be thought of as part of a huge subterranean plumbing system after a rain water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock and percolates beneath the land surface eventually some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water the term water table refers to the upper surface of this saturated zone calcite calcium carbonate the main mineral of limestone is barely soluble in pure water rainwater however absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation the water combining chemically with the carbon dioxide forms a weak carbonic acid solution this acid slowly dissolves calcite forms solution cavities and excavates passageways the resulting calcium bicarbonate solution is carried off in the underground drainage system it was once believed that caves formed near the earths surfaceabove the saturated zonewhere the water moved downward through the cracks and pore spaces this view however left many cave features unexplained why for instance are cave passages nearly horizontal in places crossing folded or tilted rock structures how would horizontal passages form at several different but persistent levels recent studies of the movement and chemistry of ground water have shown that the first stage in cave developmentthe dissolving of carbonate rocks and the formation of cavities and passagewaystakes place principally just below the water table in the zone of saturation where continuous mass movement of water occurs a second stage in cave development occurs after a lowering of the water table the water table normally sinks as the river valleys deepen during this stage the solution cavities are stranded in the unsaturated zone where air can enter this leads to the deposition of calcite which forms a wide variety of dripstone features the chemical process causing deposition of calcite is the reverse of the process of solution water in the unsaturated zone which dissolved some calcite as it trickled down through the limestone above the cave is still enriched with carbon dioxide when it reaches the ventilated cave the carbon dioxide gas escapes from the water just as it escapes from an opened bottle of soda pop the acidity of the water is thereby reduced the calcium bicarbonate cannot remain in solution and calcite is deposited as dripstone minerals found in caves many interesting minerals are found in caves in addition to the calcite which forms the major features aragonite a calcium carbonate mineral similar to calcite but not as common often occurs in intricate needles known as anthodites gypsum calcium sulfate and related calcium sulfate minerals are next to calcite in abundance some caves although they are developed in limestone have extensive passages lined with fine curling growths of gypsum flowers in other caves selenite a less common variety of gypsum forms long transparent rods or nests of fibrous crystals sulfates of sodium and magnesium are also found in caves although they are less conspicuous than gypsum iron minerals in the form of oxides limonite and hydroxide goethite occur in caves and in some places form stalactites manganese minerals in caves are commonly present as thin sooty coatings on walls and ceilings and in earth fills nitrocalcite calcium nitrate is abundant in earth fills in many caves but individual fragments are generally microscopic barite barium sulfate and celestite strontium sulfate also occur in earth fills in some solution caves clay minerals exist in relatively pure forms these include the less common varieties attapulgite and endellite in deep caves encountered during mining operations a number of ore minerals have been found in the decorative wall draperies most common are azurite and malachite forms of copper carbonate about 50 other minerals also have been reported in cave deposits uses of caves studies are underway in europe to extend the use of caves for domestic cold storage air conditioning and water supply purposes a large cave in southwestern virginia is used as a natural tunnel by the southern railway from the early 19th century through the civil war caves in kentucky tennessee virginia west virginia alabama georgia arkansas and missouri were important sources of nitrates an essential ingredient of gun powder surface or nearsurface accumulations of nitrate salts form coatings on rock walls fill cracks and crevices and mingle with cave earth the origin of the nitrate salts is not clearly understood but the salts are believed to result from the action of nitrifying bacteria on organic matter or humus although no accurate records of production were kept it has been estimated that over 15000 tons of niter earth producing 200 tons of potassium nitrate were removed from mammoth cave in kentucky between 1811 and 1814 caves have also been a source of bat guano a material mined as a phosphate fertilizer in the southern united states and mexico in general the largest deposits have occurred in limestone caves within the flight range of the mexican freetailed bat at the cache site you will see several caves these caves have been made by water and wind causing the limestone rock and dirt under the rock to erode away to form a big cave one cave is big enough for a lot of animals or even people to hide and seek shelter in the other caves might get big enough for people or animals to live or seek shelter

conservation area are another unique feature created by the runoff of the wisconsin glacier within the conservation area you will find an extensive network of 12 solution caves the erosion of sedimentary rock created this cave system when an underground stream flowed through the rock the cave system is one of the most extensive systems found in ontario and exhibits depositional features including stalactites columns and flowstone history and geology of the rockwood area 410 million years ago rockwood was in the tropics the days were only 20 hours long because the world was spinning faster than today rockwood and most of southern ontario was covered by a tropical inland sea rockwood was located in a shallow part of the sea where there was a thriving coral reef the coral grew in pinnacles to the top of the water because it needed sunlight it would die back when the water level fell mollusks such as snails and clams lived in among the coral they are now extinct but are ancient relatives of todays edible shellfish over millions of years their shells piled up eventually becoming limestone cliffs that are up to 36 metres tall over 60 million years ago the continents started to collide gradually the super continent pangaea began to break apart a piece of pangaea called laurussia began to drift north during this change the earth moved volcanoes erupted and the landscape transformed the climate changed completely and became very cold 11000 to 16000 years ago was the peak of the ice age in the area instead of being covered by a tropical sea rockwood was covered by the wisconsin glacier that was a kilometre thick as it grew the great glacier worked like a bulldozer smashing everything in its way the glacier was so large it went from the rocky mountains to newfoundland 10000 years ago the moderate climate began finally free of its heavy load of ice the earths crust began to rebound this left bald limestone and water at rockwood as well as interesting rock formations that are visible today first lichens appeared on the land and algae on the water together they formed the first moss then ferns evolved followed by grasses wild flowers shrubs and eventually soft wood although the past thousands of years had the greatest impact of what we see today one can even go back much further to 420 425 million years ago were the area was part of the eramosa a member of the lockport formation or rock with gradational contacts with the goat island member area to the south and the guelph formation area immediately to the north these among other formations are also part of the lockport formation the rocks forming the eramosa are mostly dolomites but the composition varies from almost pure greyweathering fine grained dolomite to shaly bituminous brownweathing bioturbated dolomites fossils are common at some localities scarce at others and chert is generally a minor component the most characteristic feature is bituminous shaly interbeds probably the eramosa was deposited in several related environments most likely including shallow restricted and poorly oxygenated marine waters which we see signs of being present here today in the valley outside of this cave cave formation cave formation begins when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it falls through the atmosphere rain water must have carbon dioxide to become acidic it must be acidic to chemically react to the limestone bedrock rainwater is absorbed by the soil into the ground as rainwater comes through the soil it absorbs more carbon dioxide that is being produced by plants that are dead this changes the ground water to a weaker form of carbonic acid h2o + co2 = h2co3 as it travels down through the ground it comes to solid rock when the rock is limestone or dolomite caves can form the water reacts chemically with limestone and slowly a larger and larger space will form this happens because the rocks are made of calcium carbonate caco3 this is what you call chemical erosion as the space becomes larger and larger the water can flow through as it flows it erodes physical erosion washes away rock and sand this is what makes a cave larger and forms an underground stream finally over hundreds of thousands of years or even millions of years the cave is formed the above process of cave formation is how this particular cave has formed over time the opening to this cave is small and then opens up into a chamber then another small opening into a 2nd chamber examine the chambers walls and ceilings and look for cracks and evidence of where the water seeps in and erodes the rock around it feel the rock and see if its more soft and brittle than that of the smaller areas that you have to crawl through if you come here in the winter the opening may be blocked to some degree by ice stalactites formed by the water dripping down from within the opening of the cave and you may also notice water in the floor of the first chamber which you can observe the evidence that the water comes from both inside the caves dripping down though the cracks and also from outside of the cave that may flow inside during wet periods as the area outside of the cave is in a valley and there normally is a stream just a few meters from the cave opening resident cave man for 6 years during the 1980s there was a man who called this cave his home he had his fire just inside the door of the cave and the smoke from the fire would exit through a 1 inch hole that he made to the outside the ashes from his fire would fall down another hole which he made and then would be able to empty them the park eventually sent him his eviction notice cave access access to the cave is from a side trail that takes you to the backside of an impressive set of limestone cliffs follow the side trail to get access to the valley on the other side and then follow the base of the cliff to the cave opening which you will find at ground level it may be a bit muddy at times around the cave opening there are some pieces of wood and an old car tire lining the ground to the entrance of the cave it is a tight fit and you need to crawl in on your belly once inside you will encounter a chamber which you should be able to stand in then in another tunnel at the back right within this chamber that leads to a 2nd chamber again you will need to crawl on your belly through this tunnel to access the 2nd chamber in order to log this earthcache you will need to access both chambers in order to get the required information and make your observations tasks and logging requirements 1 with the use of a thermometer take the temperature at the outside of the cave within the 1st chamber and then within the 2nd chamber make sure you let the thermometer adjust long enough at each of these 3 places so as to get an accurate reading many gpss are able to take temperature readings too on my unit when powered off pressing the power and enter buttons simultaneously will power on the unit to a diagnostics screen that will show the temperature as one of the settings what are the 3 temperatures you record and explain why you think the temperatures are as such 2 which chamber is bigger and which is taller what evidence do you see that can support your answer related to how this cave was formed 3 while in the chambers of the cave examine the rock around you looking for cracks or openings how deep and how wide at the surface is the deepest crack or gap that you can find and is there evidence that water may flow through these cracks perhaps contributing one day to more tunnels and chambers being formed in this cave how do you think this cave or the surrounding area of limestone cliffs that houses this cave will be changed in 500 10000 100000 or even many millions of years 4 is there any ice formations in the cave describe is the ice transparent translucent or opaque 5 within the 2nd chamber is a set of names along with a year the first name is joe what is the 2nd name and what is the year email me the answers to the above questions and then go ahead and log this earthcache feel free to post pictures too activity you can try mix a mild acid vinegar with a base baking soda the reaction of the two substances illustrates the process of carbonic acid dissolving limestone however actual limestone solution by carbonic acid is a weaker less noticeable reaction

GCPT88,40.2218,-77.19018,Type.traditional,taken from lewis the robber outlaw with a conscience by linda franz long before jesse james rode his way into americas folklore pennsylvania had its own outlaw folk hero david lewis better known as lewis the robber gained fame for his exploits as a counterfeiter and highwayman and for his ability to break out of jail beginning about 1812 and until his 1820 death lewis the robber terrorized and thrilled inhabitants of cumberland county and beyond tourists could find much to entertain them in the tale about him did he bury treasure in the county follow the trail to one of his alleged hideouts cave hill near carlisle fact and fiction blended even before his death lewis the robber was shot in the arm by a pursuing posse in 1820 after holding up a wagon train bound for bellefonte on seven mountains road lewis died of his wounds less than two weeks later at age 30 his death was recorded in the july 12 1820 edition of the york recorder under the headline david lewis for the last time it read the notorious offender the robin hood of pennsylvania died in the jail of centre county he was the terror of the mountainous parts of pennsylvania and even when apprehended always contrived some means of escape according to legend lewis robbed from the rich gave to the poor and didnt harm his victims a pittsburgh gazette account published shortly after lewis and accomplices robbed a pittsburgh merchant riding alone along the turnpike near sideling hill pointed out his good qualities with all his villainy there is something magnanimous in his conduct it said after the merchant was seized lewis saved his life by not allowing his comrades to kill him it went on to say that while jailed in bedford lewis escaped but the gazette said he would not let a fellow prisoner who had robbed a widow escape with the others swearing that any man who could rob a woman was not fit to associate with gentlemen mac e barrick extensively researched lewis the robber before dying in 1991 barrick wrote that lewis was regarded as a despicable villain and infamous cutthroat at the time of his capture and death but within 50 years became a benevolent outlaw who stole from the rich gave to the poor helped unfortunate widows and never killed anybody barrick suggested lewis never killed anybody only because he was an ineffective killer and added he wasnt a very good robber either because he usually was caught shortly afterward but there is no denying that lewis was an escape artist he escaped several times from the bedford county jail and once from chambersburgs jail part of his public appeal may have been that he didnt look like an outlaw an account in the april 13 1816 bedford gazette describes lewis as six feet high slim straight and well made ruddy complexion large sandy whiskers sandy or yellow hair cut in the fashion genteel in his appearance easy in his gait polite in his manners serious in his conversation and seldom seen to laugh local writer craig kennedy says one story about lewis involved a cumberland county widow as lewis was set to rob her she told him the constable was coming the same day to take her cow because she couldnt pay her taxes lewis asked her how much she owed and gave her the money the widow paid the constable while lewis waited at the end of the lane he accosted the constable as he left the farmhouse and stole back the money he had given the widow as well as some other money the constable was carrying he said it was the best shortterm investment he ever had kennedy says another story about lewis has him riding with the posse that was looking for him several stories tll of lewis accompanying people who were afraid of being stopped by the robber although people used to search for treasure left behind by lewis just one account remains of treasure found the altoona tribune in 1878 reported two hunters shot a squirrel that ran into the trunk of an old oak tree reaching into the hollow trunk they found a pot full of spanish doubloons english sovereigns and other coins all dated before 1820 several packages of paper that were retrieved crumbled to dust the coins amounted to several thousand dollars and were presumed to have been placed in the tree by lewis the robber hideout still famous early in his lawbreaking career lewis reportedly lurked in the carlisle area cave hill in north middleton township just north of carlisle was said to have been one of his hideouts barrick wrote that lewis first made his appearance at pine grove furnace about 1813 his first reported robbery there was in 1813 or 1814 at a sawmill on mountain creek below the mouth of tumbling run the rock formation above tumbling run still is called lewiss rocks for his hideout there state forester gary zimmerman says legend tells of gold or money stored in that area cave hill was shortened by explosives by the pa turnpike commission while building their turnpike and former exit ramp along cave

GC27KDA,38.11722,-83.53613,Type.earthcache,watersheds a watershed refers to land that is drained by an interconnected system of rivulets streams rivers lakes and groundwater water from a watershed eventually drains into a common destination both rain and snow contribute to the watershed watersheds can range in size from just a few square miles to many hundreds even millions of square miles watersheds are important as habitats for many creatures and as a source of drinking and recreational water for many communities because one watershed can often be connected to another watershed that lies downstream the environmental quality of one watershed can affect other watersheds as more communities rely on watersheds for their drinking water the preservation of watersheds is becoming more urgent to function properly a watershed needs to be maintained in a fairly undisturbed state especially near watercourses this undisturbed habitat helps to keep unwanted pollutants and excess soil and runoff from reaching the water course the preservation of watershed habitats is recognized as a priority by local regional and national governments watershed floods flooding although it usually carries a negative connotation is a natural process and is simply the response of a natural system a river system to the presence of too much water during an interval of time when this happens water must move out of the channel the bed or deeper part and out onto the surrounding area known as the floodplain floods are caused by a variety of factors both natural and manmade some obvious causes of floods are heavy rains melting snow and ice and frequent storms within a short time duration when humans build homes and towns near rivers the result has been the disastrous consequences of floods floods have historically killed more people than any other natural disaster because of this humans have attempted to manage floods using a variety of methods alluvium one positive result of flooding or streams leaving their banks is the deposition of silt clay gravel and organic matter in floodplains this material is called alluvium alluvium results in very fertile soils the licking river floodplain that is now underwater above the dam was fertile farmland resulting from the deposit of alluvium many farmers and residents were displaced when the dam was constructed now the dam prevents flooding of land below the dam which also includes fertile alluvial farmland residing in the floodplain of the river flood intervention hazard assessment because of the potential of a flood to destroy life and property men and women have for centuries developed ways to prepare for and fight this natural disaster one common way to manage floodwaters is to construct dams to stop excess water from inundating dry areas another way is to divert floodwaters away from populated areas to planned areas of flood storage to this end flood control reservoirs are kept partially empty so that they can catch floodwaters when the need arises these reservoirs then release the water at a slower rate than would occur under flood conditions hence reservoirs give the soil time to absorb the excess water about onethird of reservoirs in the united states are used for this purpose flood intervention history of flood control dams around 29502750 bc the ancient egyptians built the first known dam to exist the dam was made of rubble masonry walls on the outsides and filled with 100000 tons of gravel and stone the dam was not watertight and water flowed through the structure quickly eroding it away the second type of dam known to have been built was an earth dam called nimrods dam in mesopotamia around 2000 bc around 100 ad the romans were the first civilization to use concrete and mortar in their gravity dams both of these types of dams were watertight methods of construction the evolution of flood control dams is too extensive to cover here but you get the idea mankind has been using dams for flood control a very long time cave run lake so this earthcache brings you to cave run lake a river runs through it that river is the licking river the head beginning of the river is in magoffin county the mouth of the river empties into the ohio river across from cincinnati early explorers called the river great salt creek because of the many salt licks found along its banks indians called it nepernine salt seeping waters construction of a flood control dam on the river by the louisville district of the corps of engineers began in 1965 and was completed in 1973 the dam was constructed with the primary purpose of flood control but the resulting lake provides an alluring source of recreation as well the dam controls runoff from an 826 square mile drainage area or watershed water is held back by the dam and released gradually so that flooding does not occur downstream there is a good diagram at the posted coordinates showing how this works along with lots of other interesting information when i was a kid living at zilpo upriver from the dam there were times when we could not go to school because floodwaters came across the road i hope you will take time to walk around a bit here to experience and learn more about flood control dams an emergency spillway 650 ft wide and 23 ft lower than the top of the dam is located at n 38 06729 w 83 31959 this is a safety measure that would prevent water from overtopping the dam i also hope that you will consider what the land above the dam was like before it was flooded imagine the licking river flowing through that area and fertile fields in the floodplains where farmers most often grew corn imagine all of the streams and rivulets draining rainwater from the land and into the river in a way all of that is still there a lot of it is just underwater now please email answers to the following questions to me to get credit for this earthcache the watershed directly around cave run lake primarily consists of what type of

GC1VWQX,38.9924,-94.48513,Type.earthcache,water is one of the earths more powerful landscapers you would be hard pressed to find a feature on earths surface that hasnt been shaped by water in some form or fashion yet it is also a remarkably subtle landscaper taking hundreds thousands even millions of years to produce many of the geologic features we see today waterfalls are a popular example of how water has shaped the earth varying in shape structure and magnitude they can create amazing scenic vistas while demonstrating how active our earth is in real time their formation alone is an example of the power of water waterfalls form when water flows over a ledge or step in the rock bed underneath the speed and amount of water as it reaches this point will affect the position and shape of the waterfall if the underlying rock is soft enough the waterfall will slowly recede over time if the underlying rock is hard recession may not occur without a large volume of water and sediment flowing over the edge ponds can form at the bottom of the waterfall if the rock layers at that point are soft as well the force of the water as it hits the bottom carves away the softer rock slowly creating what is called a plunge pool sediment and rocks moved around by the force of water will further carve away the underlying rock another feature that can form as a result of softer rock is an overhang this happens when the rock at the top of the waterfall is hard but it lies on top of a much softer rock as the water hits the water in the plunge pool some of the water will splash back against the wall slowly carving away the soft rock until an overhang develops if enough soft rock is worn away over time then the hard rock located above my begin to suffer enough stress that it eventually will break causing the waterfall to recede even further oftentimes you will find waterfalls surrounded by canyons or gorges when this is found it usually means that the waterfall has been active for a long time the canyon or gorge is formed as a result of the waterfall slowly receding during the course of its lifetime if you observe enough waterfalls youll begin to notice just how varied they can be and not just because of the amount of water or how tall they are there are different types of waterfalls determined by how the water flows through the system common waterfall classifications with pictures block water from a wide river or stream drops over a ledge forming what appears to be a sheet of water cascade water flows down a series of steps or stages cataract large powerful and water flows with a lot of force fan water falls through a relatively narrow crest and spreads out and becomes wider as it descends horsetail water descends down remaining in contact with the surface rock most of the time plunge water descends vertically without contact with the surface rock punchbowl water falls through a constricted area and descends down into a pool of water segmented pieces of land segment the river causing the water to split in separate sections as it descends tiered separate consecutive waterfalls in close proximity that are close enough that they are generally seen as one long waterfall multistep a series of waterfalls one after another of roughly the same size each with its own sunken plunge pool not to be confused with tiered which dont have separate plung pools it is not uncommon to find waterfalls that meet the descriptions of more than one classification in such instances a waterfall would be classified as both for example the last step of a cascade waterfall may include a plunge waterfall thus classifying it as a cascade plunge cave spring falls the waterfall in cave springs originally received water from three tributaries one was a former lake that has since disappeared due to the kansas city flood in the 1950s and local construction the following aerial photo was taken in 1931 the mentioned lake is seen in the lower left corner the current nature center would be in the lower right the road on the right site is nearby gregory blvd notice the perfectly round circles those are the greens of the old golf course formerly located here another source was the nearby cave located at n 38deg 59580 w 094deg 29039 this cave used to supply a considerable amount of water up until the 1940s when the construction of a nearby church resulted in the discovery and subsequent plugging of a nearby underground spring in 1928 it was reported that the cave spring pumped out about one million gallons of water a day the photo below shows water coming out of the cave in the 1930s a third source of water was another nearby creek this creek actually fed into the same source stream that traveled from the lake to the waterfall adding to the water in that stream both this stream and the stream from the nearby cave converged into the single stream the provides water for the waterfall to complete this earthcache to complete this earthcache you will need several supplies make sure to bring with you a camera measuring tape or yardstick a timer or watch with a seconds hand and a bucket or some other wide mouth item to measure water dont forget your gpsr send answers to s 1 and 2 to the cache owner post 3 with your cache log 1 using the above classifications identify what classification of waterfall this is 2 measure the amount of water flowing over the edge of the waterfall see instructions below this can be done in litershr litersday gallonshr or gallonsday make sure to specify what units of measure you are using optional 3 take a photo of yourself with the waterfall in the view consider stopping by the nearby cave which helps supply water to the waterfall note taking a photo is part of the original intended requirements with the amount of camera phones out there most people can get a quick photo the photos are helping in documenting the waterfall but if you are unable to obtain a photo or need help with getting the photo posted let me know in your email i wont delete your log over not having a photo but it can be cool to see how much variance the waterfall has in photos over the years instructions for measuring water flow the more accurate method for you to measure the water flow is to measure how long it takes to collect a measured amount of water this is easiest to do with a bucket before you go out to do this cache make sure you know how much water the bucket can hold if need be measure out a set amount of water and pour it into the bucket until close to full then mark the water level with a marker or tape when setting this up i marked off a bucket at the 4 liter point once you have the necessary supplies you have permission from the park manager to walk right up to the waterfall to make your measurements first get your timer ready when ready place the bucket under a point in the waterfall and time how long it takes to fill the bucket or reach whatever measurement mark you previously determined perform this test at least twice and average then record your times next measure the width of the bucket at the point you marked earlier record the width it is easy to get the wrong measurement for how wide the waterfall is at the point before the water starts to drop to keep measurements more accurate across all measurements i will provide my measurement which was 30 inches across now for some math a = the amount of water in the bucket my example was 4 liters b = the time it takes to fill the bucket with the amount of water in a c = the width of the bucket d = the amount of times b goes into 1 minute to calculate the amount of water multiply a times d divide 30 inches by c multiply these two numbers together to get the amount of water that flows over the waterfall in one minute 1 liter of water equals 26 gallons of water 1 gallon of water equals 379 liters of water park information park hours park open daily year round from 9am sunset nature center

GC273MR,37.22758,-80.01305,Type.earthcache,cave spring virginia encompasses 118 square miles and has a population of 25789 people officially its not a town it is a magisterial district of roanoke county the name of this sizeable area is derived from one relatively small but enticing triangular hole in a rock outcropping that thousands drive by each day and might not even notice not even many roanokers know where the areas titular cave spring actually is it is located just off brambleton avenue rt 221 the history of the cave spring can be found at the welcome to cave spring geocache this earthcache will focus on the geological formation of this landmark introduction first of all thanks to tony and teresa for their permission to post this earthcache the cave spring is on private property but is visible from a public road so no trespassing is necessary to enjoy its beauty the property includes the spring an historic bunkhouse and a renovated log cabin please show your appreciation for the landowner allowing this earthcache to be placed by not passing the fence that plainly separates the private property from old cave spring road parking is available at the waypoints below this has become a very high traffic area so exercise caution when crossing roads cave formation all caves are not created equal in fact no two are exactly alike there are different kinds ice karst volcanic tubes sea caves and they are formed by many different processes chemical erosion wave action subsidence dissolution lava floes no one is able to accurately predict how long it takes a cave to form there are just too many variables and often these are unobservable since they are underground forces such as streams wind lava acid rain or ocean waves over time can carve out spaces large enough for us to walk in cave spring as the name connotes serves as the discharge point for an unseen underground river if you were to look around this area you would find the closest creek is on the opposite side of old cave spring road but its elevation is lower than the elevation of the cave spring so this creek cant be the source of the spring in fact the spring actually feeds this creek therefore the recharge zone of the spring must be underground invisible to us but how and why does it exit at the spring the appalachians the roanoke valley is located in a band of geology which spans the western third of the commonwealth called the blue ridge mountain province this physiographic province is part of the appalachian mountain range and extends from pennsylvania to georgia the blue ridge contains the highest mountains in eastern north america the three primary rock types in this province are limestone dolomite and shale there are few surface streams in the limestone valleys of the blue ridge province as runoff from mountain slopes disappears into the subsurface upon contact with the karst bedrock water then flows underground emerging at springs on the valley floor so what in the world does karst mean karst topography not all bedrock is solid karst is a german word derived from the slovenian kras which means bare stony ground it was originally used to describe a limestone plateau near trieste slovenia now the term means any landscape with distinctive landforms and hydrology shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone calcium carbonate caco3 or dolomite calcium magnesium carbonate camgco32 both of these rock types are slightly soluble in water karst terrain is characterized by springs caves sinkholes and aquifers that are highly productive but also vulnerable to contamination about 20 percent of the land surface in the us is classified as karst other parts of the world with large areas of karst include china europe the caribbean and australia in the united states about 40 of the ground water used for drinking comes from karst aquifers in western virginia karst terrain occurs along slopes and in valleys between mountain ridges virgina counties with karst topography some karst formations called speleothems can be the very dramatic stalactites stalagmites drapery straws and flowstone that are showcased in publicly accessible cavern systems along interstate 81 most caves are formed in limestone karst common speleothems the process rain can collect carbon dioxide as it falls to the earth forming a weak carbonic acid acid rain the addition of carbon dioxide greatly increases the solubility of the water once rain has been absorbed by the soil it picks up additional carbon dioxide from decaying organic matter and plants in this way the water passing through the soil and into the underlying rocks has the capacity to dissolve limestone and dolomite the ground water enters cracks and fractures in these layered rocks and begins to dissolve it when the water reaches an underlying layer of impenetrable rock the water moves sideways forming an underground river subterranean water follows difficult to predict paths bearing little relationship to surface topography depending on the acidity of the water and the path it takes through the rock a cave may form if it finds an exit from the rock this is called a spring most karst groundwater returns to the surface at springs near streams and rivers like this depending on the constancy of the water source rainfall or snowmelt that infiltrates the earth a spring may be ephemeral intermittent or perennial continuous cave spring cave spring is also a tributary of a creek this area has many springs that can be observed from public roads if this spring was in a depression or sink hole it might have formed a pool spring house with a pool but cave spring flows under the road into mud lick creek which in turn flows north into the roanoke river near the norwich neighborhood of roanoke city roanoke river eventually flows into albemarle sound and the outer banks of north carolina thats a journey of 400 miles and 1093 vertical feet for this spring water discharge from cave spring toward mud lick creek what youll see depends on the time of year you visit in the summer the view of the cave entrance is obscured by wisteria vines but is still partially visible spring is a beautiful time to visit as the landowner has accented the landscape around the entrance with various blooming flora if you visit the cache in december you may see a very special extraterrestrial visitor at the cave entrance who has appeared annually in recent years the inside scoop the water level in the cave only averages 165 deep it would have almost no depth if left to flow naturally across the impenetrable bedrock below but it has been modified by a manmade concrete dam across the cave entrance photos show this was in place as early as the 1960s and i theorize that the dam and the groove in the middle of it were installed to channel the water into a flume shape for easier bottling when the water is low it flows through an opening under this dam into a concrete channel crossing the lawn of the property to contain flooding the waters source in the earth keeps the water at a constant 55 degf all year long so it feels cold in the summer and warm in the winter springs including this one provided refrigeration for perishables in pioneer times immediately beyond the entrance that you can see the ashaped ceiling quickly diminishes at a steady slope on the left and by means of a large bouldershaped formation on the right the scallopedshaped patterns on the slopes of the ceiling surfaces indicate the downward path of the water in the dissolution process cave spring ceiling there is some staining on the ceiling of the cave which is evidence of the introduction of some surface water which has left iron and other mineral deposits from the soil behind as the photos show there are no dramatic stalactites and stalagmites but there are small white calcite deposits visible both inside and outside the entrance the approximate depth of the cave is only 20 feet and the source of water is a hole at the remote tip of this conical volume beyond this hole its source remains unknown inside view at water level some of the caves inhabitants have included bats trout introduced by a landowner until the flood of 1985 released them crayfish and even ducks we once observed a crayfish inside

outdoors people generally like this section of virginia the high level of rainfall makes cave springs a pretty wet site the month of may is the wettest with most of the rain while october is the month with the least amount of precipitation the stone stairs will take you there cave springs provided cool water on a hot day for the native americans many years ago now its a source of water for a crystal clear pool of spring water for hikers and campers to enjoy geology of cave springs springs may be formed in any sort of rock cave springs is formed in the greenbrier limestone formation in virginia the largest springs are formed in limestone and dolomite in the karst topography of the region both dolomite and limestone fracture relatively easily when weak carbonic acid formed by rainwater percolating through organic matter in the soil enters these fractures it dissolves bedrock when it reaches a horizontal crack or a layer of nondissolving rock such as sandstone or shale it begins to cut sideways forming an underground stream as the process continues the water hollows out more rock eventually admitting an airspace at which point the spring stream can be considered a cave this process is supposed to take tens to hundreds of thousands of years to complete cave springs in particular flows through the native limestone a sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate and is a rock of marine origin derived from the lime mud and ooze that accumulated on calm shallow sea floors millions of years ago the cave springs campground sits on a karst landscape its characterized by the presence of caves springs sinkholes and losing streams created as groundwater dissolves soluble rock such as limestone or dolomite the evidence is all around you as you will notice below cave springs surface are natural cavities filled with water the nearby tunnels and caves are formed when slightly acidic water combines with limestone or dolomitic rock and dissolves the rock creating a cavity water flow from springs cave springs can be classified by how much water is being discharged if a spring flows only after a hard rain is called an ephemeral spring but if it flows yearround it is classified as a perennial spring cave springs is a perennial spring the amount of water that flows from springs depends on many factors including the size of the caverns within the rocks the water pressure in the aquifer the size of the spring basin and the amount of rainfall human activities also can influence the volume of water that discharges from a spring groundwater withdrawals in an area may reduce the pressure in an aquifer causing water levels in the aquifer system to drop and ultimately decreasing the flow from the spring the entrance to the cave is protected by a heavy metal door

virginia karst terrain occurs along slopes and in valleys between mountain ridges for most areas in western virginia a fairly limited range of rock types is present one of the most important influences on a sedimentary rocks resistance to erosion is its quartz content the more quartz a rock contains the more resistant it will be to erosion in western virginia sandstones generally consist mostly of quartz siltstones and shales ie fine grained fg clastics are usually admixtures of quartz and other less resistant minerals limestones ie carbonates of course are composed of calcite which is rather susceptible to chemical weathering however some carbonate rocks do contain a fair amount of quartz especially in the form of chert and can be a bit more resistant to erosion than their more pure relatives in addition the carbonate rock dolomite is generally somewhat more resistant to erosion than limestone another equally important characteristic is how well the grains of a rock are consolidated known as its induration well indurated rocks have either intergrown crystals or the grains are joined together with a lot of intergranular cement most limestones are initially well indurated the induration of sandstones siltstones and shales ie clastics varies from outcrop to outcrop in addition over time weathering may dissolve the cement and weaken the rock quartz cements are very resistant to dissolution calcite cements dissolve rather readily iron oxides and clay minerals are fairly susceptible to chemical alteration as a result of these two factors composition and induration sedimentary rocks display a wide range of susceptibility to erosion generally wellindurated quartz sandstones are the most resistant to erosion likewise limestones and poorly indurated shales are the most susceptible to erosion other sedimentary rock types are a bit more difficult to place within this spectrum for example all else being equal a moderately indurated siltstone would probably be a bit less resistant to erosion than a moderately indurated conglomerate unless the siltstone has quartz cement and the conglomerate has calcite cement then the rates of resistance would be reversed rain can collect carbon dioxide as it falls to the earth forming a weak carbonic acid acid rain the addition of carbon dioxide greatly increases the solubility of the water once rain has been absorbed by the soil it picks up additional carbon dioxide from decaying organic matter and plants in this way the water passing through the soil and into the underlying rocks has the capacity to dissolve limestone and dolomite the ground water enters cracks and fractures in these layered rocks and begins to dissolve it when the water reaches an underlying layer of impenetrable rock the water moves sideways forming an underground river subterranean water follows difficult to predict paths bearing little relationship to surface topography depending on the acidity of the water and the path it takes through the rock a cave may form if it finds an exit from the rock this is called a spring most karst groundwater returns to the surface at springs near streams and rivers like this depending on the constancy of the water source there are three types of water flows ephemeral intermittent and perennial an ephemeral waterbody is a wetland spring stream river pond or lake that only exists for a short period following precipitation or snowmelt they are not the same as intermittent or seasonal waterbodies which exist for longer periods but not all year round to claim credit for the find please email me the answers to these questions 1 what are the approximate dimensions of the cave entrance 2 is the spring ephemeral or perennial 3 what kind of stone do you think forms the structure

en bas this is where youll be standing to take the picture but at the bottom lusk cave was created about 12500 years ago due to the natural phenomenon of erosion its a very special case as the caves are rather rare in the canadian shield because the rocks are too hard erosion implies a mechanical water and wind or chemical surface disintegration of the rock or ground the degree of erosion depends on the characters of the rock its hardness its capacity of dilation or its chemistry mechanical disintegration occurs under the action of a physical force which tears off pieces of more or less bulky rock either by freezingthaw or by abrasive wear water glacier wind the remains carted by these factors are effective in the process of erosion they act like sandpaper on a piece of wood the mechanical erosion is particularly active in the cold gel and thaws andor arid regions the wind erosion attacks the rocks by removing particles or by polishing its surface it is as much more effective than the obstacles are nonexistent and than the wind is powerful regular and charged with dust or spray in the case of the lusk cave the thick layer of ice that had covered the land for thousands of years began to melt releasing enormous amounts of water water trapped beneath the ice is forced under pressure into cracks in the rock unlike the surrounding rock the soluble sediment quickly yields to erosion and a series of tunnels begins to take shape the glacier has melted but the stream from lusk lake continues to carve the rock although slower than the action of the meltwaters this process persists for more than 11000 years in places where the roof of the cave is too thin the ceiling collapses and blocks passageways some tunnels are filled by the rubble but the main tunnel is kept open by the stream to log that cache youll have to publish a picture of you and your gpsr in the cave with the wooden bridge as a background above at the posted coordinates and send me by email the answers to the following questions what type of rock got dissolved to create the lusk cave what is the name of the glaciation which covered the whole country the last of the four what is the total length of

n 42deg 44900 w 071deg 30062 mr seeker will be at the east end and mrs seeker at the west end to greet cachers and give you last minute instructions the mine falls park advisory committee mfpac has asked us to focus on the canal mill pond and cove not the nashua river due to the large group of geocachers attending with boats we plan to have four boating work crews 1 the cove 2 east end of canal to whipple st bridge this is believed to be the worst section of the canal for trash 3 west end of canal to whipple st bridge 4 mill pond and inlet the canal in mine falls park work crews 1 and 2 will meet at the nashua millyard parking listed above work crews 3 and 4 will meet at the conway ice arena parking listed above we would like to have at least one canoe in each work crew if you have a strong preference about which work crew you are assigned to please post a note on the cache page or email us directly generally we would suggest that the west end of the park is better suited to geocaching teams which include children on friday we will post the assignment for each work crew so that you know whether to report to the east parking or the west parking warning this waterway cleanup could be rough on your watercraft in that it could get scratched and will certainly get messy those in canoes and kayaks should not put themselves at risk trying to remove debris the mfpac boat will be at the east end to remove larger debris large debris in other areas can wait for the mfpac boat to be available for removal if at all possible please arrive at 830 am so that we can have boats in the water and working by 900 am we will have coffee juice and donuts available at both parking areas starting at 830 am others in attendance at the mfp trail day will be mfpac members park rec personnel high school student volunteers gate city striders members etc these volunteers will primarily be maintaining trails and removing trash that us boaters place along the trails by the waterways gate city striders are the sponsors of this trail day they will have about 30 tshirts to give away as well as raffle prizes gift certificates to a shoe store getting a tshirt might be difficult as they will likely be handed out at lincoln park where most of the trail workers will be meeting however some of the shirts may be brought to our two meeting areas at the ends of the park in order to be entered in the raffle you will need to sign up on a paper that should be available at both of our meeting areas look for a mfpac member to sign up for the raffle sponsored by gate city striders although running water is not available at either boat launch area we recommend that you wash off your boat at home following the event to remove any invasive plant species thereby preventing their spread to other waterways things to bring canoekayak paddles pfds for yourselves extra pfds that you would be willing to loan to cachers coming without a boat long pants and sleeves to help protect against poison ivy and biting insects protective eye glasses insect repellent sunscreen hat durable shoes or boots that might get wet or muddy things mfpac parks and rec will provide but which you could also bring your own in case the materials are late arriving to our meeting areas or in case the turnout is so great that there are not enough trash bags medical gloves bottled water grappling hooks old lacrosse sticks mfpac found these are the best tool for removing debris while on the water pool skimmers or fish nets safety reminders be careful working on and near the water avoid poison ivy dont swing tools over your head if you have allergies bring epipen andor take necessary precautions wear gloves when removing trash afterwards do a thorough check for ticks remember to look back at the cache page on friday midday to check your work crew assignment thanks original cache description mine falls park in nashua is a special place for geocaching in new hampshire containing the first nh cache more caches than any other park in the state one of nhs two earthcaches and lots of winding waterways to make getting from cache to cache a real adventure if you have enjoyed caching in mine falls park and would like an opportunity to help maintain it we in collaboration with the mine falls park advisory committee mfpac and nashua park and recreation department would like to invite you to join the first cito event for geocachers at mine falls park were sure that many of you would really like to be able to help out in this way as the mfpac has been very friendly to geocaching and wed like to be able to demonstrate the appreciation of the geocaching community for their support of our hobby a special need for this cito event is waterway cleanup due to the heavy use of the park there is a fair bit of trash that has accumulated along the canal and other waterways in the park the mine falls park advisory committee could really use some help in getting the waterways cleaned up we know that there are many cachers in the area with a canoe or kayak given how many folks have found the paddling caches here in southern new hampshire if you can attend the event please let us know by posting a will attend log on this event page please also include the information of whether or not youll be bringing a boat so that we can plan the scope of the trail and waterway cleanup accordingly everyone is welcome and no experience is required just wear appropriate work clothes long pants long sleeves and work gloves are recommended particularly for nonpaddlers and durable shoes or boots that might get wet or muddy youll probably want to bring along drinking water bug spray and sunscreen as needed dont forget to also bring your gps to find a cache or two after the cleanup the specific details of our meeting place within the park for starting the mornings activities are still being determined but we wanted to get this announcement on the geocachingcom website as soon as possible so that you can mark this date and time on your calendars well add more information regarding the specific meeting place and other planned events to the cache page as it

camera these items are required for you to ultimately claim a find so please plan and come prepared warning under no normal circumstances should you attempt to enter the cave it is dangerous inside the cave is protected within cliff cave county park and can only be explored by permit from the st louis county department of parks and recreation how caves are formed caves are formed in many ways by far the most common way is by the dissolution of sedimentary rock by acidic water there are other forces that can create caves following are the descriptions of several solution caves by far the most common caves are solution caves these caves are formed through the interaction of air water soil and rock they usually form in areas where the dominant rock is limestone a type of sedimentary rock many solution caves feature streams and lakes and unusual mineral formations typically a cave like this forms over a period of several million years slump caves slumping in geological terms occurs when large sections of rock or a land mass moves its position away from or toward other sections of rock or land mass usually in the direction of a downslope the speed for this movement is typically very very slow however quick changes can occur especially with the occurrence of earthquake activity or frequent flooding slump caves can be formed when two large sections of rock move together and voids occur between the sections sea caves over time waves crashing against the base of a cliff can form a sea cave a sea cave forms along a vertical zone of weakness in the rock perhaps a crack or an area of softer rock the erosive power of the waves wear away the rock creating an opening that can deepen and expand with an overhang where the cliff rises above the waves sea caves are typically found in sedimentary rock such as sandstone and limestone they are less commonly formed in hard rock such as granite lava caves lava which is molten rock on the surface of the earth can create long intricate cave systems when lava flows it typically flows down a slope in a shape that resembles a long skinny tongue the tongue is a channel of flowing lava with the hotter fasterflowing lava in the center of the channel and the cooling lava closer to the edges of the channel the cooling lava on the edges solidifies forming walls and eventually a crust over the top of the lava flow when the eruption stops the remaining lava flows out of the voids and a tubelike cave remains additional lava flows can occur over the top of the cave burying the cave deeper and deeper bacteriaformed caves there are bacteria that thrive on oil deposits deep within the earth these bacteria which are named extremophiles because they thrive in extreme conditions expel a gas that combines with oxygen to create sulfuric acid this highly corrosive acid eats away at limestone leaving behind gypsum and creating the large voids of caves this bacterial process can feed upon itself with some of the bacteria eating the byproducts and other minerals accelerate the formation of caves manmade the word cave implies a feature created by natural forces therefore there really is no such thing as a manmade cave we have other words to describe the holes that humans have created in the earth humans have dug holes for many reasons including shelter passage mining disposal battle escape etc basic geology of cliff cave cliff cave is a solution cave it is formed from rock from the st louis limestone formation from the mississippian period the limestone rock is 362 to 320 million years old the cave was formed during the ice age and the best theories have the cave formation starting during either the yarmoth interglacial period 300000 to 600000 years ago or the aftonian interglacial period 700000 to 900000 years ago the current mapping of the cave from the missouri geological survey rolla defines the caves length as 4726 feet the cave has four separate entrances and contains many interesting geological formations inside such as a natural bridge falls domes tubes etc however the cave has very few typical ozark cave formations such as flowstone stalactites or stalagmites basic history of cliff cave the cave is believed to have been discovered and used by humans as early as 7850 bc the cave has a lot of native american history so much so that it is sometimes called indian cave the cave has history with the osage illini chickasaw and choctaw the osage and illini saw the cave as sacred likely because in winter months the cave emits a visible mist through its openings a sign to the people of the presence of the spirit being from 1830 to 1880 the cliff cave wine company used the cave to store and age wine the manmade brickwork and masonry that you see there was constructed by the wine company in the 1910s anheuserbusch stored beer in the cave in the 1920s the mob dumped bodies in the cave from the 1700s through just recently the cave has always periodically been the site for recreational activities crime and debauchery in 1993 a number of counselors and children were killed when during an exploration outing they were trapped in the cave by a flash flood in recent history there have been repeated occurrences of people becoming lost inside the cave basic ecology of cliff cave currently the cave stream is almost dead and supports only a few frogs and cave isopods in the past before urban pollution destroyed the fragile habitat of the cave it supported albino crayfish albino salamanders and blind fish the big brown bat and the eastern pipistrelle bat still live in the cave vandalism uncontrolled digging and excavation spray painting and pollution have taken a toll on the natural appearance and habitat of the cave logging requirements according to earthcache rules in order to claim the find you must perform an educational task so i ask that you do the following requirement 1 measure the temperature difference this is a big cave and when you approach the posted coordinates you are going to notice a temperature difference in the air flowing from the cave especially if it is a hot day you are going to feel much cooler air if it is a cold day the air will be warmer andbalmier as you approach when you reach the posted coordinates place your thermometer such that it is in the air flow from the cave away from direct sunlight leave it there for ten minutes and then record the measured temperature now back at the parking lot do the same place the thermometer in the grass next to the parking lot away from direct sunlight and not on the hood of your car and leave it there for ten minutes then record the measured temperature at that location compare the two measurements what is the temperature difference requirement 2 find some answers not far from the cave you will find an interpretive display that describes cave formation and geology the display is located at n38deg 27525 w090deg 17265 from that display find answers to the following questions 1 most cave passages contain a material which consists of deposits that are washed into the cave such as sand gravel or clay what is material known as 2 the study of caves is called speleology according to the display what four fields of science is it based on requirement 3 email send me an email through gccom that provides your temperature readings and answers requirement 4 photo post a photo of yourself with the entrance of the cave in the background post your photo on the cache page with your find logthe photo should clearly show that you were present at the cave i do not care about your gpsr appearing in the photo post your photos with your online log and email me with your answers logs not accompanied by email and photo within a reasonable amount of time will be deleted

environment when plant debris dies and falls into the swamp the standing water of the swamp protects it from decay swamp waters are usually deficient in oxygen which would react with the plant debris and cause it to decay this lack of oxygen allows the plant debris to persist in addition insects and other organisms that might consume the plant debris on land do not survive well under water in an oxygen deficient environment pennsylvania particularly the appalachian plateau and allegheny mountain range was at one time a series of islands and swamps leading to the creation of a large amount of coal in the state before mining began there was an estimated 228 billion tons of bituminous and anthracite in pennsylvania as of 2001 12 billion tons still remain in the ground most of which is not economically feasible to mine american geologists recognized the importance of pennsylvanias coal region and named the upper carboniferous period the pennsylvanian period because of the abundance of coal in the state coal mining coal mining in pennsylvania helped fuel the industrial revolution in the united states in 1889 pennsylvania was americas number one coal producer that year alone more than 80000 tons of coal were mined statewide over the last two hundred years pennsylvania has produced more than onequarter of the nations total coal output the early steel and transportation industries relied heavily on local supplies of this valuable natural resource later coalburning power plants would supply much of the countrys electicity today coal still generates 40 of the worlds electric supply in pennsylvania 53 of all energy is currently produced from coal railroading railroading was the biggest business of the 19th century few industries affected the growth of america as significantly as the development of the ability to transport goods and people by rail with the completion of the horsehoe curve in 1854 and the transcontinental railroad in 1869 largescale expansion into the western united states became possible at this time the pennsylvania railroad company prr operated 7000 engines and 250000 cars making it one of the largest railroad companies in the nation the city of altoona was a major hub for the prr spur lines could now bring goods into the towns and export local resources to the mainline and ultimately the rest of the united states one such spur line was the bells gap railroad lloydsville the town of lloydsville played a crucial roal in the coal mining history of this region lloydsville is situated along the allegheny front where the lower alleghenies to our east meet with the higher peaks of the allegheny mountains to our west this area was home to numerous easily accessible seams of bituminous coal these seams were heavily minded to help fulfill americas energy needs during the industrial revolution the town of lloydsville prospered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for several reasons lloydsville possessed abundant coal and timber resources ans well as a strong determined workforce in 1872 lloydsvilles population was made up of almost 600 coal miners the pennsylvania railroad mainline was only 20 miles away in the town of bellwood when the bells gap railroad spur was built in the 1870s it connected the people and resources of lloydsville with the prr mainline and the rest of the nation watersheds and acid mine drainage what is a watershed a watershed is a region of land that drains to a common waterway any precipitation that falls in the area of this earthcache will drain into a stream called lloydsville run lloydsville run flows into bells gap run which in turn flows into the bellwood reservoir the altoona city authority treats water from the reservoir and distributes it to thousands of residents living in blair county bells gap run continues beyond the bellwood reservoir and eventually drains into the little juniata river which is a tributary of the juniata river which flows into the sesquehanna river the chesapeake bay and ultimately the atlantic ocean watersheds are important because human activities directly impact the quality of the water within them by protection local watersheds you are protecting both your drinking water supply and crucial aquatic ecosystems acid main drainage amd the unfortunate environmental legacy of hundreds of years of coal mining in pennsylvania includes approximately 2400 miles of polluted streams irresponsible coal mining has resulted in pennsylvanias number one source of water pollution acid mine drainage amd acid mine drainage forms when the mineral pyrite also known as fools gold which is often associated with seams of coal becomes exposed to the atmosphere air and water break down pyrite into sulfuric acid and iron compounds as groundwater carries this sulfuric acid through the mine spoil it dissolves and leaches out toxic metals the resulting main drainage can contain not only iron but also other metals such as aluminum and manganese this combination of metals and acid can have disastrous effects on the ecosystem of a receiving stream recognizing acid mine drainage there are many methods and techniques that can be used to determine if a steam is being affected by amd the most recognizable indicator is the color of the water and steam bed the most common colors associated with amd are red and orange and these colors will stain materials that they contact this staining is known as yellow boy and consists of iron that was once dissolved in the water as this iron oxidizes it coats rocks and cements the stream bed bottom amd that appears white or milky can idicate the presence of aluminum other ways to determine the presence of amd include testing the ph sulfates and metals in the water another method is to look at the amount of diversity of insect life in a stream this technique is and excellent method to gauge the health of the stream by examining the abundance and diversity of macro invertebrates with careful analysis this method can provide insight into the degree of degradation in some cases the united states environmental protection agency lists bells gap run as impaired by metals silt and low ph values cleaning up acid mine drainage when amd is present two of the most common methods to address the problem are active treatment and passive treatment however it can be quite difficult and expensive to remediate land and water resources that have been affected by amd nonpoint source pollution active treatment active treatment is the continuous addition of chemicals to waters polluted by abandoned mine drainage frequently used chemicals include limestone hydrated lime soda ash and caustic soda active treatment systems are used throughout the commonwealth and the generally perform quite will however there are several drawbacks to active treatment of amd first most systems require a reliable power source for operation also the purchase and delivery of chemicals can be costly the chemicals must then be mixed and aerated into the polluted waters to settle system maintenance as well as sludge removal from settling posds creates a financial burden for system operators finally onsite chemical storage is often a problem because many abandoned mine sites are in remote locations passive treatment a passive treatment system is a great way to use natures own chemical and biological processes to treat amd and improve water quality early research into amd led scientists to find that natural wetlands were capable of filtering and treating amd pollutants without significantly harming the wetland system unlike and active treatment system there is no continuous activity of a person of machine treating the amd thus operating and maintenance costs are significantly lower for passive systems several types of passive treatment systems have been implemented across the state such as open limestone channels diversion wells anoxic limestone

explosions occur in mines when a buildup of methane gas a byproduct of coal comes into contact with a heat source and there is not enough air to dilute the gas to levels below its explosion point each ton of coal contains between 100 to 600 cubic feet of methane when air contains 5 to 15 of methane it can explode mine explosions can also be triggered when fine particles of coal dust come into contact with a source of heat in a worst case scenario a methane explosion has the potential to ignite a more catastrophic coal dust explosion kermit mine disaster mingo county had never suffered a major mine disaster until january 18 1951 when the no 1 mine at the kermit burning springs collieries company exploded the mine was opened in 1942 and located twentyone miles west of williamson west virginia they employed 80 men and 68 of the men worked underground at the time of the accident 45 men were inside the mine however the explosion was confined to only one section thirteen men were working in the section that blew and eleven men were killed shortly after the explosion a motorman delivering a trip of empty cars near the site noticed smoke and dust in the haulageway he immediately notified the outside mine office of his findings and superintendent t l lambert went underground to investigate investigators said the only piece of electrically driven equipment in operation at the explosion site was a loading machine which had three poorly made splices in a trailing cable they reasoned this could have exposed conductors to make contact with the machine frame which could have produced sparks capable of igniting gas causing the explosion although the possibility that the explosion may have be ignited by someone smoking could not be discounted officials declared the explosion to be accidental and not the fault of carelessness of either mine officials or the men working the disaster left behind eleven grieving widows and thirtysix fatherless children resources

sabraw it is certainly possible and what we are doing is enabling that to happen additional information west virginia coal formation of coal there are two basic requirements for the formation of coal a source of plant material and preservation of that material from decay the change from plant fragments to coal is gradual consisting of many stages after dead plant debris sinks into the waters of the swamp bacteria go to work breaking down the cell structure and reducing the plant material to rotted wood and leaves fine fragments or a jellylike mass bacterial action probably continues for only a short time after the peat is buried under sand and mud deposits in the swamp as the layer of sediment grows thicker its weight compacts the peat to a fraction of its original thickness driving out moisture and closing pore space temperature increases steadily as the peat is buried deeper and deeper below the surface of the earth as thousands of feet of sediments are added the increasing heat sequentially alters peat to lignite subbituminous coal bituminous coal and finally anthracite this process of coalification works slowly and brings about these changes over large areas types of coal <url> there are four basic types of coal lignite subbituminous bituminous and anthracite lignite is the lowest rank of coal with the lowest energy content lignite is crumbly and has high moisture content lignite accounts for about 7 of us coal production subbituminous coal has a higher heating value than lignite subbituminous coal typically contains 3545 carbon compared to 2535 for lignite about 44 of the coal produced in the united states is subbituminous bituminous coal contains 4586 carbon and has two to three times the heating value of lignite bituminous coal was formed under high heat and pressure it is the most abundant rank of coal found in the united states accounting for about half of us coal production anthracite contains 8697 carbon and has a heating value that is on average slightly higher than bituminous coal it is very rare in the united states accounting for less than 05 of the coal mined in the united states <url> west virginia coal mining facts <url> coal was first discovered in what is now west virginia in 1742 by john peter salley in what is now boone county coal occurs in 53 of west virginias 55 counties only jefferson and hardy in the eastern panhandle have no coal fortythree counties have reserves of minable economic coal wv coal resource table there are 117 named coal seams in west virginia sixtyfive seams are considered minable in 2009 coal was produced from 51 different coal seams in west virginia the pittsburgh coal seam accounted for nearly 31 million tons of production in 2009 west virginia has 4 of all coal reserves

is the residual of the cave erosion and forms piles and dunes inside the huge cavern sand cave is a wind cave which means it is formed by winds destroying and sculpturing the sandstone sandstone is a very common sedimentary rock and perhaps the best known sedimentary rock it is formed in many environments the grains of sand are composed of individual crystals of various minerals such as quartz iron oxides manganese oxides and other impurities can cause bright and contrasting colors in sandstones these colors are what give sandstone its unique character and ornamental desirability the colors range from bright whites reds yellows oranges and even purples and greens colored sandstone is usually intricately banded in multiple colors which enhance its aesthetic appeal the sandstone deposits of sand cave are a beautiful part of the natural environment in the cave although sand cave is just a rock shelter there are various features of a true cave on hot summer days the inner parts stay

GC108Y2,45.78055,-68.97583,Type.earthcache,come visit and find out if these caves are true ice caves or just a geological quirk that allows the cave to appear to have perpetual ice formations when the last continental glacier moved through the area it was traveling generally to the south in this area during the ice ages the temperatures became lower and probably more important the amount of rain in the area increased so there was a lot of snow which did not melt during summer and formed increasing shields of ice the glaciers as ice is not as hard as rock it starts moving under pressure and with the several thousand foot high shields of ice the pressure of the its own weight was more than enough to move the ice so the ice of this northern glacier was kind of flowing south always melting at the tip and compressing the earth as it traveled as long as the amount of new ice was greater than the amount which melted at the head the glacier increased moving south covering valleys and hills the moving glacier pushed the fragments of rock like a snow plough during a warm period the glacier became shorter and left the rocks only a short distance from their origin these rock piles are very angular and are called talus this cave is a talus cave which means huge boulders of rock lying in a heap do not really fit and so there are crevices and cracks between them the shrinking glacier leaving huge boulders which came from the north formed these caves talus caves are rather rare especially the big ones the average yearly temperature in this area of maine is about thirtynine degrees fahrenheit which is not cold enough to support a true ice cave while the ice appears to be in the cave year round it is generally replaced each year with new ice very late into the fall even though this is not a true ice cave it is an interesting place to visit as you explore the ice cave in the late fall it becomes apparent why the ice stays in debsconeag ice cave that much longer above the caves at the top of the ridge is what appears to be a large pseudosink in the granite which is right above a small hole about 30 cm square in the very back of the cave this hole appears to have great seasonal flows of water the inlet is above the floor of the cave with the outflow about 2 meters above the floor of the cave one would speculate that as the spring approaches and the cave is at its coldest the water enters the cave the ice is formed from the bottom of the cave up with the heaviest water flow being allowed to leave the cave after the formation of the floor ice this is referred to as a static ice cave which is simply a deep hole with a small entrance with limited air drainage out the bottom the cave acts as a cold trap where the cold dense air is trapped and the warm air is excluded while it does not prevent the ice from melting it does slow the process most years this cave contains ice late into the fall with extreme winters causing the ice to persist for several years before it disappears this cave is unique because the water flows into it as soon as it starts to melt in the spring allowing a greater build up of ice in the cave that is protected in early summer by snow cover because most people visit the cave in the heat of the summer or early fall and find ice they assume that it must therefore contain ice yearround the debsconeag ice cave is located in a beautiful old open pinespruce forest along the side of a wilderness lake it can be reached by canoe then hiking from debsconeag deadwater or a hike from the gate at the end of the abol road the cave is about 60 meters in length and can be safely explored if you decide to explore the cave make sure to be prepared for 39 deg f 4 deg c temperatures and bring you own light source several would be preferable in case one goes out inside the cave the rocks are slick and jumbled and often covered with snow and ice the ice cave can be entered from either of two entrances but one requires a rope while in the other rope only adds that margin of safety once inside you are in a large room with three choices the passage to the right goes up and finally reaches a small skylight the passage to the left appears to be the main drain for the cave and is a low flat room slope downward until it becomes packed with rocks the last passage headed to the north go from a crawl to a room three times

allouez conglomerate eight million pounds of copper were removed from this mine the mine had 5 shafts that reached a depth of 1400 ft with 10 different levels as you walk the ground level area of the mine evidence remains of waste discarded by the mine figure 1 waste rock pile at the delaware mine photo by paul t brandes cache coordinates n 47deg 25410 w 088deg 06121 earthcache lesson why is there copper in the keweenaw peninsula a precambrian midcontinent rift formed around 11 billion years ago over the next 100 million years layers of volcanic and sedimentary rocks were deposited into the rift valley then hot water moved through the rocks filling the open pore spaces with native copper and other minerals geologist call this hydrothermal mineralization the copper is commonly found in the permeable layers of conglomerate between the sand and pebbles the keweenaw peninsula has two types of copper deposits lode deposits and fissure deposits the lode deposits comprise of conglomerate lodes rocks held together by copper and amygdaloidal lodes almondshaped deposits in the top layer of lava flows figure 2 bedrock geology map this map illustrates where copper conglomerates are located source <url> the fissure deposits are veins along fractures that parallel or cross the beds originally the delaware mine started as a fissure vein mine the ground was poor but there was enough copper to continue mining that site mining fissures was difficult for the miners to remove the large pieces of copper later miners started to mine conglomerate loads because the copper was easier to remove and more consistently found than in the fissure copper lodes the conglomerate loads could be mined more efficiently with the ore blasted out taken to the surface and then railroaded to stamp mills even though the conglomerates were rich in copper only about 2 of the ore rock hauled to the surface was copper the remaining rock was called poor rock and set in piles near the mine or hauled away and put to other uses another waste product of mining was stamp sand stamp sand is still a problem plaguing the keweenaw peninsula what are the properties of copper copper is an element and a mineral copper would appear red in color on a polished fresh surface and it would appear dull brown on a tarnished surface due to oxidation if you were to scrape copper on a streak plate the streak color would be red copper has a metallic luster copper is not a hard metal ranked 253 on mohs hardness scale copper could be scraped by a nail piece of metal or quartz however copper is hard enough that you will not be able to scrape it with your finger nail if you find copper in the rock pile it would most likely be irregularly shaped and less than three inches in size logging your visit to obtain

suffosion sinkhole b in terms of size specifically referring to depth what could have caused these differences 6 from the suffosion sinkholes walk another 20m north along the trail and describe what you see please use geological terms if possible olmsted cave is situated at the south end of a woodland that extends to highland road this woodland and the storm water management pond to the south are part of hamilton park owned by the city of hamilton it is not a part of the eramosa karst conservation area even though it contains many karst features the area surrounding olmsted cave has been developed and has negatively impacted this unique geographical feature olmsted cave is the second biggest cave in the karst region a number of other areas in ontario have single sinking streams and springs and some areas have two or even three sinking streams in close proximity what distinguishes the karst area is the large number of sinking streams and associated karst features as a result of urban development in 2000 one of the prominent sinking streams upper olmsted creek has been diverted into a storm sewer and no longer sinks in olmsted cave olmsted cave was probably the principal recharge point for olmsted spring recent urban development has redirected runoff in the former upper olmsted creek watershed to storm sewers and there is no longer any surface runoff sinking at olmsted cave although flow in the olmsted karst system has been greatly reduced as a result there is still some flow emerging from olmsted spring indicating that it still receives some diffuse recharge or possibly some allogenic recharge from other sinking streams olmsted cave is an important component of the olmsted karst it has a relatively large scenic entrance although the cave itself is not especially long the main entrance is a vertical shaft about 3 metres deep prior to recent construction upper olmsted creek sank in the entrance flowed across the floor of the cave and sank in breakdown slabs and silt covering the floor the flow from the former upper olmsted creek watershed is now directed into storm sewers if the capacity of the storm sewer and storm water management pond is ever exceeded then the overflow will drain into olmsted cave next to the main entrance of olmsted cave there is a long narrow slot that forms a karst window a karst window is a rockwalled depression usually with vertical walls with a stream flowing across its floor from one side to the other typically they are created by collapse of a bedrock roof into an underlying cave passage olmsted cave has about 30 metres of passage with a shaft entrance and a long skylight entrance developed along a prominent vertical joint the remaining two caves are small each drains an area of just a few hectares and the stream passages in the caves are correspondingly smaller in size being about 2030 centimetres in width and effectively impassable to humans there are several karst features situated in the woodland to the north of olmsted cave these are all contained within hamilton park a broad shallow valley extends from olmsted cave to highland road it is an excellent example of a dry valley about 30 metres to the north of olmsted cave a tiny stream sinks in an excellent solution shaft this shaft probably leads to the unexplored extension of olmsted cave and the various solution shafts may have acted as overflow sinks debris at the base of the shaft prevents further exploration further to the north there are a number of suffosion sinkholes developed along the dry valley prior to recent construction upper olmsted creek sank in olmsted cave and flowed in the subsurface for a distance of 380 metres to olmsted spring the unexplored cave or conduit is probably at a depth of 5 metres or more for most of its length an approximate minimum depth of this passage could be deduced by an accurate leveling survey at the cave and at the spring upper olmsted creek no longer exists water tracing with fluorescent dyes has confirmed that olmsted cave drains to olmsted spring the rapid tracer responses at the springs indicate that flow is through dissolutional caves or conduits olmsted spring is situated at the head of lower olmsted creek the spring and the creek are entirely contained with a park owned by the city of hamilton north of highland road this park is zoned as open space much of it is grassed and a paved footpath extends along its entire length the original spring has been completely buried by fill adjacent to or beneath highland road currently water emerges from the fill as well as from a small culvert during high flow the geomorphology of olmsted spring is entirely destroyed and restoration would be difficult or may even be impossible apparently the burial of the spring under fill has not had a significant impact on its hydrology since tracer tests indicate rapid groundwater velocities typical of karst lower olmsted creek extends from the spring for 150 metres before being directed into a storm sewer along its length there are at least three discrete sinkpoints where the stream loses water much of the creek is forested or undeveloped there is some minor fill and garbage at the sinkpoints and along the creek this has only had a minor impact on the geomorphology and hydrology of these karst features removing the garbage and fill would readily restore the sinkpoints as well as the creek the surface karst features in this area have been slightly to severely impacted by existing urban development and ongoing construction nevertheless some of the karst features that remain are key to the protection of the provincially significant karst systems within the ansi area of natural and scientific interest here are some terms that may help you in your understanding of the above information and in your answers cave a natural cavity in the ground which is large enough for human entry an arbitrary minimum leng dry valley a valley which lacks a permanent surface stream karst a landscape characterised by solution features such as karren dolines caves sinking streams and springs karst window a depression with a stream flowing across it caused by collapse of bedrock into a cave passage overflow sink a sinkpoint for a creek that is only used under high flows when sinkpoints further upstream are unable to handle all the flow sinkhole a sinkpoint spring a natural outflow of water to the surface congratulations to the cito group for the shared ftf

pinned by a rock and trapped in the cave eventually perishing despite a large and well publicized rescue operation this sad episode credited with focusing a great deal of national attention to mammoth caves this is the start of the trail to sand cave history of sand cave william floyd collins was exploring sand cave in 1925 when a rock lodged on his leg and he became trapped a frantic rescue effort followed which became a major media event newspaper and radio updates followed the progress and a reporter actually crawled into the cave and interviewed him while he was trapped thousands of people came to the rescue site so many showed up that vendors set up concessions and souvenir stands and a carnivallike atmosphere ensued the rescue effort failed when the cave ceiling collapsed between him and the rescuers they could no longer provide him with food and warmth they frantically get digging but floyd died a few days later of starvation and exposure his body was later removed and displayed for tourists in crystal cave which he had discovered when the park service purchased crystal cave his family requested his body be moved so it is now buried in the cemetery at the mammoth cave baptist church the collins family owned crystal cave a tourist cave in the same general area as mammoth cave although particularly beautiful crystal cave experienced a disappointingly low amount of business because of its relatively remote location collins wanted to find another entrance to mammoth or a new cave along the road leading to mammoth in order to more easily draw off some of those tourists collins made an agreement with three farmers with land closer to the main highway in the area if he found a cave with commercial potential on their land the owners would pay to develop the cave and collins would share in the proceeds from operating it as a tourist attraction working alone over a period of three weeks he explored and expanded a hole that would later be dubbed sand cave by news media on january 30 1925 after a few hours work collins managed to squeeze through various narrow passageways he claimed that he had discovered a large chamber though this claim was never verified because his lamp was dying he had to leave quickly before exploring the chamber he became trapped in a small passage while on his way out he accidentally knocked over his lamp putting the light out and then he dislodged a rock from the ceiling pinning his leg it was later discovered that the rock weighed only 26 12 pounds but it was wedged in such a manner that neither he nor rescuers could reach it he was trapped only 150 feet from the entrance after being found the next day by friends hot food was taken to floyd and an electric light bulb was run down the passage to provide him light and some warmth and he survived for over a week while efforts to rescue him were made the cave passage used to reach collins collapsed in two places on february 4 the rescue leaders believing the cave to be impassable and too dangerous began to dig an artificial shaft to reach the chamber under collins the 55 foot shaft and subsequent lateral tunnel actually intersected the cave just above collins but when finally reached on february 17 he was found dead from exposure and starvation because they did not reach collins from the rear the rescuers still could not remove the rock from his leg deciding it was too dangerous to remove the body the rescuers left it where it lay and hastily filled the shaft with debris a doctor later estimated he had died three or four days previously friday february 13 being the most likely after the body was left in the cave a funeral service was held at the surface however homer collins was not satisfied with sand cave as a final resting place for his brother two months later homer and friends reopened the shaft dug a new tunnel to reach the opposite side of the cave passage and retrieved the body on april 23 1925 on april 26 floyds body was buried

secluded portion of crystal in a chained casket in 1961 crystal cave was purchased by mammoth cave national park and closed to the public most of the family had long objected to floyds coffin being placed in the cave at their request the national park service reinterred floyd collins in nearby flint ridge cemetery on march 24 1989 it took a team of 15 men three days to remove the casket and tombstone from crystal there was some objection to this from cavers in europe where notable explorers are often buried in caves they discovered the notoriety of the rescue helped fuel interest in the

GC1X32J,36.60233,-83.66745,Type.earthcache,at cumberland gap the first great gateway to the west follow the buffalo the native american the longhunter the pioneer all traveled this route through the mountains into the wilderness of kentucky modern day explorers and travelers stand in awe at this great gateway and the many miles of trails and scenic features found in the park follow the footsteps of early travelers along the wilderness road experience what the pioneer the civil war soldier the traveler saw when they first traveled through the cumberland gap the water flow you are looking at is from the original opening of gap cave this is the location that the early pioneers daniel boone indians and many others would stop and get fresh drinking water this was also a place soldiers would bath and relax when there was a garrison located nearby during the civil war if the cave could talk im sure it would have many stories to share what is a mountain spring a mountain spring is the result of an aquifer being filled to the point that the water overflows onto the land surface they range in size from intermittent seeps which flow only after much rain to huge pools flowing hundreds of millions of gallons daily in virginia kentucky and tennessee as in any other part of the world springs where a great source of fresh water although infrequently mixed with saline or salt water some springs would have a strong rotten egg smell due to relatively high hydrogen sulfide gas content most springs in virginia however do not suffer from such conditions gap spring offered a cool drink on a hot day or water with which to cook or bathe in for the native americans and early settlers who traveled through the gap im sure daniel boone drank from this spring when he traveled through the gap in the winter when other sources of fresh water were frozen gap cave spring often can be found flowing freely today the spring water is is an source of water for nearby communities gap cave spring can be classified by how much water is being discharged if a spring flows only after a hard rain is called an ephemeral spring but if it flows yearround it is classified as a perennial spring gap cave spring is a perennial spring how are springs formed springs may be formed in any sort of rock gap cave spring is formed in the greenbrier limestone formation in virginia the largest springs are formed in limestone and dolomite in the karst topography of the region both dolomite and limestone fracture relatively easily when weak carbonic acid formed by rainwater percolating through organic matter in the soil enters these fractures it dissolves bedrock when it reaches a horizontal crack or a layer of nondissolving rock such as sandstone or shale it begins to cut sideways forming an underground stream as the process continues the water hollows out more rock eventually admitting an airspace at which point the spring stream can be considered a cave this process is supposed to take tens to hundreds of thousands of years to complete gap cave spring in particular flows through the native limestone a sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate and is a rock of marine origin derived from the lime mud and ooze that accumulated on calm shallow sea floors millions of years ago the town of cumberland gap also sits on a karst landscape its characterized by the presence of caves springs sinkholes and losing streams created as groundwater dissolves soluble rock such as limestone or dolomite the evidence is all around you as you will notice below gap cave surface are natural cavities filled with water the nearby tunnels and caves are formed when slightly acidic water combines with limestone or dolomitic rock and dissolves the rock creating a cavity water flow from springs the amount of water that flows from springs depends on many factors including the size of the caverns within the rocks the water pressure in the aquifer the size of the spring basin and the amount of rainfall human activities also can influence the volume of water that discharges from a spring groundwater withdrawals in an area may reduce the pressure in an aquifer causing water levels in the aquifer system to drop and ultimately decreasing the flow from the spring permission for this earthcache is allowed by the cumberland gap national historic park always ask for permission before

GC1WM41,36.60282,-83.667,Type.earthcache,beneath the mountains lie miles and miles of subterranean passages these caves are dark wet worlds with unique geologic formations and animals that have adapted to survival in the underground there are 24 known entries to limestone caves the best known of which is gap cave gap cave is located at the base of the pinnacle mountain in cumberland gap national historical park just beneath the cumberland gap the first doorway to the west several mountain ridges run along the borders of the three states virginia kentucky and tennessee cumberland gap is one of the lowest passes in the area and was the best possibility to cross the mountains for the treks of the early settlers on their way west did you know gap cave has also been called king solomons cave soldiers cave and cujos cave the cave was originally referred to as gap cave because of its proximity to the gap when early pioneers saw the cave they knew they were about to cross the mountains into the wilderness of kentucky throughout the years this cave had numerous names first it was named gap cave by dr thomas walker as it is located in cumberland gap later it was called soldiers cave and king solomons cave the name cumberland gap saltpetre cave recalls the time when salpetre for gun powder was mined in the cave as the book by trowbridge became popular it was dubbed gap cave but the present owner cumberland gap national historical park renamed the cave to gap cave its original name however it seems most people still know it as cujo cave cujo was a runaway slave who is said to have hid in the cave during the civil war the point with the legend is that cujo got killed by confederate soldiers inside the cave this is only 5km from the border to kentucky which was a neutral state and so would have been the rescue for cujo so the legend tells about failure in looking distance of the goal there is a book by john townsend trowbridge 18271916 called gap cave it was first printed in boston 1864 and is a historical novel about the civil war telling much of the story of this cave the cave is almost undeveloped although it is a show cave for a long time the former private owners cleaned the floors to allow a rather comfortable walk through the cave and built 183 steps for the steeper parts but still the floor is uneven in many points and sturdy shoes are much recomended the cave is not lighted lamps for the visitors are provided by the guides the geology of gap cave gap cave is a natural underground void large enough for a human to enter some geologists suggest that the term cave should only apply to cavities that have some part that does not receive daylight gap cave is an solutional cave formed in rock that is soluble such as limstone the largest and most abundant solutional caves in the usa are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes sinking streams and underground drainage gap cave is adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation these include flowstones stalactites stalagmites helectites draperies soda straws and columns these secondary mineral deposits in the cave are called speleothems all those stalactites a highlight of the trip is the talking stalactite or gurgling stalactite it is a rather common stalactite with one specialty it makes a strange sound like a tree frog or a chirping cricket the sound is produced by water probably a drop of water falling through a crack in the limestone ceiling as i stared through the dim lantern beams and viewed the spectacular stalagmites it made me realize how many years it took to create this natural artwork in the underground caverns of gap cave there are 75 foot pillars serving as an impressive wonder of natureit takes a stalagmite about 100 years to increase by an inch some stalactices represent 90000 years of growth a stalactite from the greek word for drip and meaning that which drips is a type of speleothem that hangs from the ceiling or wall of limestone caves it is a type of dripstone stalactites are formed by the deposition of calacium carbonate and other minerals which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions every stalactite begins with a single mineralladen drop of water when the drop falls it leaves behind the thinnest ring of calcite each subsequent drop that forms and falls deposits another calcite ring eventually these rings form a very narrow hollow tube commonly known as a soda straw stalactite soda straws can grow quite long but are very fragile if they become plugged by debris water begins flowing over the outside depositing more calcite and creating the more familiar coneshaped stalactite the same water drops that fall from the tip of a stalactite deposit more calcite on the floor below eventually resulting in a rounded or coneshaped stalagmite unlike stalactites stalagmites never start out as hollow soda straws given enough time these formations can meet and fuse to create columns with a fairly mild climate cumberland gap is a great place to visit any time of year summers can be hot and humid with temperatures commonly in the mid to upper 90s winters are generally mild with rain and some periods of snow january through march temperatures usually range in the 30s and 40s weather can sometimes be unpredictable especially at higher elevations if

balloon which was launched from andy warhols grave we came across this beautiful little shelter in the middle of the forest on the very top of the mountain come find me if you can you can walk the trail to about 15 miles away and then youre bushwhacking there are two ways to the cache and you arent going to like either of them the good news is you arent going to run into anyone who thinks lpcs are fun this is a small because that is what i had with me and there really isnt a good place to put an empty ammo can important info from dcnr on the way in let someone know where youre going and when youre coming back check the weather forecast and plan accordingly you might want to reconsider that cache hunt if severe weather is predicted do your homework before you seek use maps to find a route that will minimize your impacts know what roads and trails exist that will bring you closest and safest to the cache youre seeking staying on trails will minimize your impact on the area prolonging the life of the cache when you leave your car mark its location as a waypoint sounds silly but once you get deep into the cache hunt its easy to get disorientedgps unit when hiking on a trail stay on the trail even if it is muddy or wet to avoid widening the trail or creating side trails when going offtrail consciously think about leaving absolutely no indications of your passage choose your steps on solid ground avoiding mosses wet areas loose soil or steep banks step beside not on ferns and other plants try to leave no trace of your visit after youve finished searching for a cache the area should look as though you were never there or better than when you arrived eg pick up litter practice lift look replace technique if you lift a rock to look under it then replace it exactly as you found it in addition to your gps receiver always carry extra batteries a map compass and know how to use them its kind of embarrassing to get lost with a gps travel with a partner especially when traveling crosscountry or in remote areas carry water and emergency supplies even on short trips at the cache if the impacts of previous cachers essentially led you to the cache notify the owner that perhaps it is time to move or archive the cache the challenge of seeking a geocache is to use your gps unit and your detective skills not following a beaten path make sure it is the geocache before handling the thing keep in mind that the remains of meth labs have been found in the forests remains that are extremely dangerous all geocaches placed on state lands should have a green and black official geocache sticker or some other official labeling on the container if the cache is near a public area where there are muggles nongeocachers about be inconspicuous in retrieving signing in and replacing a cache to avoid vandalism do not put illegal items into a cache use your common sense in most cases explosives fireworks ammo lighters knives including pocket knives and multitools drugs alcohol or other illicit material shouldnt be placed in a cache as always respect the local laws geocaching is a family activity and cache contents should be suitable for all ages never place food items in a cache animals have better noses than humans and in some cases caches have been chewed through and destroyed because food items or items that smell like food are in the cache even the presence of mint flavored dental floss has led to destruction of a cache if you exchange trade items trade kindly consider what future finders would like to find and leave something equal to or better than what you take promptly alert the owner of any issues with their cache make minor repairs if you can it will save the owner a trip make sure the container is properly closed to prevent the contents from getting wet or destroyed put the cache back where you found it and hide it well dont move a cache if you suspect the cache is not in the intended spot hide it the best you can and alert the owner as soon as possible immediate safety concerns ie hornets nest under cache should be noted on the website and the owner notified asap after the hunt if you forgot to mark a waypoint for where you parked your car dont forget about the track back function on your gps most units which can guide you to retrace your steps back to where you started practice the same careful steps on the way out dont leave a discernable trail back though the ferns following a trip and before a new trip wash your gear boots pants cuffs etc to reduce the spread of noxious weeds and other

GC61BHC,35.66402,-85.67575,Type.earthcache,arrival at the earthcache this earthcache requires you to hike to the entrance of higgenbotham cave which is now called the historic entrance of cumberland caverns to reach the entrance you must hike part of the old chickamauga indian trail this trail is now incorporated into the cardwell mountain shellsford trail of tears and it passes within a few feet of the entrance if you are interested in the history of this trail and hiking it you can find more information on waymarkingcom here <url> if you are only hiking for the earthcache it is recommended to park at the cumberland caverns parking lot coordinates are n 35deg 39935 w 85deg 41009 the trailhead to use is immediately across the field from the parking lot at n 35 39924 w 85 41008 allow at least a hour for a roundtrip moderate hike to the entrance and back important the trail is for daytime use only higgenbotham discovery legend has it that this entrance was first explored by aaron higgenbotham in 1810 who was surveying the chickamauga trail while attempting to explore the cave alone he lost his light and spent 3 days in the darkness when his friends finally found his gear outside the cave they entered and found him shortly afterwards it is said that when they found higgenbotham his hair had turned a snowy white from his ordeal geologic history of cardwell mountain for this earthcache you will learn some basics about cave development and the limestone in which this cave is formed if you do any traveling throughout tennessee you will notice that one region will appear very different from other regions this is because there are six distinct physiographic regions within the state you would pass through all six if you were to travel along i40 and i81 from memphis in the west to bristol in the east image courtesy of sherrie collie this earthcache is located on cardwell mountain this mountain where the cave entrance is found is an geologic outlier of the cumberland plateau physiographic region this means that the mountain was once connected to the main formation of the plateau but it eventually became an isolated segment due to erosion therefore cardwell mountain and its caves consist of the same rock strata type and age as the nearby plateau the following geologic map shows the classification of the rock strata that make up tennessee note in particular that most of middle tennessee consists of geological formations that were created during the paleozoic era from between 400 and 300 million years ago within the paleozoic era is the carboniferous period this period is referenced throughout the world by geologists except that it is further divided by american geologists into the mississippian early carboniferous and pennsylvanian late carboniferous periods courtesy of the tennessee division of geology mississippian and pennsylvania strata are easily distinguished the mississippian environment of north america was heavily marine with seas covering part of the continent as a result most of the mississippian rocks are sedimentary limestone which includes marine fossils such as crinoids which thrived in the seas the pennsylvanian environment alternated between terrestrial and marine due to the presence of extensive forests this resulted in the formation of coal deposits during the pennsylvanian period cave development long after the rock strata were laid down caves began to develop in limestone caves can be formed by 1 dissolution by a weak carbonic acid in groundwater 2 erosion and 3 breakdown collapses groundwater contains a weak carbonic acid that came about as rainwater picked up carbon dioxide when it passed through the atmosphere and soil layers when the the slightly acidic groundwater passes through fractures in limestone it dissolves the limestone slowly and enlarges any openings most limestone caves are created at or just below the water table the zone below the water table is called the phreatic zone large openings are created in this zone when the water contacts all surfaces of the rock and dissolves it quickly if the water in this zone is under pressure and flowing then erosion will take place simultaneously on all sides of a cave passage cave passages formed in the phreatic zone are typically circular or oval and will have very smooth rounded shapes slowmoving water in this zone can also form large scallops on all sides of the passage the zone above the water table is called the vadose zone because this zone contains air cave development in the vadose zone mainly occurs by erosion due to running water cave passage features of vadose development are fluted vertical shafts domepits trenches in the floor of passages and layered shelves on the walls smaller scallops if present are limited to the lower sections of the passage where water has been running quickly the passages may be dry or may include actively running streams and waterfalls note that a cave passage could be enlarged both above and below the water table over time so some cave passages can have both phreatic and vadose features a classic example is a keyhole passage photo courtesy of the river city grotto of the nss jacksonville florida the wellknown speleothems of stalactites and stalagmites are formed in the vadose zone when mineral deposits occur by groundwater dripping from the ceiling onto the cave floor to log this earthcache 1 examine the historic entrance just off the trail it has rebar embedded over the opening to prevent accidental falls how long and wide is the opening in the limestone how far below is the floor of the intersected cave passage 2 from the geologic map of tennessee provided the limestone here was formed during what period of the paleozoic era

GC1XQRB,35.51112,-80.34498,Type.earthcache,typically gold mining in a region starts when someone discovers gold lying around on the ground or in a stream this was the case with the first gold find in north carolina in 1799 at what was to eventually become the reed gold mine in cabarrus county about 18 miles southwest of where you are standing in gold hill in 1823 dennis olmstead conducted a geological and mineralogical survey of the state of north carolina this was the first geological survey in the united states having to do with mineral deposits his survey focused heavily on the gold bearing rock in the region of gold hill shortly thereafter in 1824 gold was discovered in gold hill initially gold mining begins with the easy pickings placer mining placer pronounced plasser mining is possible because heavy particles have weathered out of previously solid rocks such weathered out particles are known as a deposit gold is very heavy it has a specific gravity of 193 meaning that it is 193 times heavier than water because they are so heavy these particles can be separated from lighter materials sand clay etc by running water or even air from a bellows in some cases besides placer deposits the other type of gold deposits is lode deposits and these are found imbedded in rock usually quartz as is the case at gold hill1 the unfortunate fact facing all placer miners is that easy pickings tend to be captured early once they were gone underground hard rock mining was the only alternative available to those early miners extensive mining began in 1842 and continued through the late 1850s and then stopped almost completely during the civil war period later new mining and oreprocessing techniques allowed mining to resume and continue sporadically into the early 1900s microscopic flakes of gold are widely distributed under the surface of much of the earth but are mostly in very tiny amounts geological faults fractures in rocks contraction and cracking in some types of rocks and other factors can combine to concentrate previously dispersed flakes to the extent that mining them becomes economically feasible1 at gold hill the gold particles were carried by hot liquids that filled cracks and fissures within the country rock heat and pressure drove off most of the water and other volatiles leaving behind veins of solid quartz those gold particles were now within hard solid quartz when placer mining think of a fellow with a shallow pan or bucket panning for gold was initially replaced by underground mining the latter form of mining was merely a bunch of pits dug into the earth actually such an open pit is a quarry not a mine besides making the area nightmarishly ugly it was also extremely hard work and the rewards were meager eventually the transition to truly underground mining took place such mining greatly increased the complexities of getting the ore out of the ground equipment materials experienced mining engineers and miners and most importantly lots and lots of money were all needed and all had to be in place before the first ounce of ore was mined so what would an underground mine at gold hill have looked like and what would its parts be called this is a schematic drawing of the randolph ore vein and the mine that was developed to extract that ore it is from the laney book of 1910 and was reproduced for us by the north carolina geological survey the randolph mine edit cross section of the randolph mine which was built to exploit a major vein of goldbearing ore hit the back arrow to return to the earthcache listing shaft a primary vertical or nonvertical opening through mine strata used for ventilation or drainage andor for hoisting of personnel or materials connects the surface with underground workings2 everything that enters miners supplies equipment or leaves miners ore country rock water a mine does so thru the shaft at large sophisticated mines there may have been more than one shaft with one for say miners and water pipes and another for rock and ore level at usually predetermined intervals a horizontal tunnel will depart from the shaft it is hoped that such a straight line tunnel will intersect a vein of orebearing material2 drift a horizontal passage underground a drift follows the vein as distinguished from a crosscut that intersects it or a level or gallery which may do either2 winze a secondary or tertiary vertical or nearvertical opening sunk from a point inside a mine for the purpose of connecting with a lower level or of exploring the ground for a limited depth below a level if miners were exploiting a vein using a drift and the vein went downward they would begin a winze in order to follow the vein2 whim a vertical horsepowered drum used as a hoist in a mine3 these were replaced by more sophisticated headframe gearing and winding arrangements when steampowered lifts were introduced headframe the aboveground whim or sophisticated lift and emptying hardware and structure over the shaft3 as mining became more productive and volumes of ore and rock increased dramatically the headframe or head house became a large imposing structure usually dominating the surrounding area stope an excavation in the form of steps made by the mining of ore from steeply inclined or vertical veins3 this is an old term and is not used today an area of worked over ore would be referred to as stoped on mine diagrams imagine a cavernous area underground where the ore has been completely extracted and sent to the surface for crushing mining difficulties it is well to remember the difficulties encountered by the mining companies as they attempted to get the ore mined and out of the ground water was a constant problem as ground water continuously seeped into the mine shaft and lower levels piping systems driven by stateoftheart steam powered pumps ran 24x7 in order to keep the mines relatively dry and safe shafts drifts stopes etc were all structurally different and went thru varying types of rock and ore miners and engineers had to know how each structure needed to be stabilized and made safe here is a beautiful illustration from laney that shows how technically and mechanically complicated the timber supports known correctly as cribbing had to be extensive cribbing in the randolph mine edit obviously a lot of knowledge and hard work had to take place for this degree of structure hit the back arrow to return to the earthcache listing the biggest challenge facing the engineers and miners was the sad fact that the gold at gold hill was not highly concentrated and they had to try and go after those orebearing bodies with the highest concentration of gold notes 1 there is no attempt herein to detail the geological processes behind the emplaced gold and the quartz veins as the purpose of this earthcache is to explain the structural parts of a typical underground historical gold mine 2 definitions thanks to <url> 3 definitions thanks

joint upon meeting a horizontal fracture bedding plane the water changes direction then continues to dissolve a passage and forms the generally flatlying cave until it stairsteps down at the next vertical joint wind water and time the cave formed at the contact of jefferson city dolomite the lower rock formation in the cave and the st peter sandstone that overlies it limey deposits settled in a large seabed basin about 425500 million years ago in the ordovician geologic period and formed the dolomite later in the ordovician period sand deposited atop the dolomite formed in the sandstone that makes up the caves walls and arching roof slowly water movement between these two layers began to create the cave we see today it was in the cave and the area in front of it that people lived the debris left by these people and wind blown dirt then filled up the cave the most common rock type in the bryant watershed is dolomite dolomite is usually quite deeply weathered and soilcovered you can find it making up much of the walls of the bluffs in the deeper valleys capped by the harder sandstone dolomite also crops out from the thin soil of glades on hilltops and hillsides throughout the area youll recognize it there as a dark grey to black distinctly pitted rock dolomite is composed of the mineral of the same name the mineral dolomite is a calciummagnesium carbonate camgco32 it is seldom pure but contains variable amounts of sand silt clay and chert these contaminants occur as scattered grains and clumps and as layers or lenses within the dolomite dolomite is the dominant rock type of the jefferson city formation which forms the hilltops and higher elevations of the watershed dolomite layers make up about half of the bluffforming roubidoux formation dolomite is also the rock type of the exposed top layers of the gasconade formation along the central part of the deepest valleys of the bryant general information nestled in the hills above the loutre river in montgomery county graham cave state park provides opportunities for both recreation and education the main feature of the park graham cave was formed at the point of contact between jefferson city dolomite and st peter sandstone gradual water flowing through the sandstone along with a combined action of wind and freezing worked to make a relatively large cave the cave originally extended about 100 feet into the hill but an accumulation of debris over the years filled the lower part of the cave with about seven feet of deposits an archlike entrance 120 feet wide and 16 feet high provided human and animals with easy access to shelter graham cave is named after the first settler who owned the cave property in 1816 robert graham bought some bottomland along the loutre river from daniel boones son daniel morgan boone and in 1847 purchased the property that housed the cave it remained in the graham family until its transfer to the state in 1964 grahams son df graham used the cave to shelter his hogs but also became interested in archaeology and artifacts that he found in the cave after his death his son benjamin offered his fathers collection of artifacts to the university of missouri which spawned archaeological interest in professors jesse wrench and j brewton berry wrench and berry visited the cave to assess its archaeological potential in 1930 water trickles over a sandstone ledge into a small stream along one of the parks hiking trailsbenjamins daughter frances married ward darnell who in 1948 began to enlarge the shelter for his livestock archaeologists heard of darnells activity and persuaded him to stop until they could conduct salvage excavations between 1949 and 1955 the university of missouri and the missouri archaeological society conducted extensive excavations in the cave with astonishing results artifacts found in graham cave associated with charcoal dated by the radiocarbon method provided important evidence about mans adaptation to the environment at the end of the ice age archaeological findings revealed different periods in mans use of the cave dating back to as early as 10000 years ago archaeologists uncovered artifacts that provided clues to the lifestyle of the ancient dalton and archaic period native americans who first inhabited the cave artifacts revealed that these early native americans depended mainly on hunting and fishing for food using spears as weapons they occupied the cave seasonally and apparently believed in the supernatural a ring of rocks that encircle a large stone believed to be a council ring was found in the cave and suggests that they held ceremonies pieces of pottery found in the cave indicate that it was also occupied by a more recent culture of native americans as a result of these important archaeological findings graham cave was the first archaeological site in the united states to be designated a national historic landmark in 1961 frances graham darnell donated the cave and land to the state in 1964 to create a state park after acquisition of the cave by the state park system excavations were done in 1966 to clean up the area and provide additional research since then excavations have not been conducted in order to preserve the remaining deposits today an accessible trail leads to the entrance of the cave where interpretive signs point out some of these interesting discoveries surrounding the cave is 370 acres of naturally diverse land designated as graham cave state park the park is a combination of moist bottomland forests rocky oakhickory forest and glades graham cave glades natural

atmospheric carbon coal is a readily combustible black or brownishblack rock it is a sedimentary rock but the harder forms such as anthracite coal can be regarded as metamorphic rocks because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure it is composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen along with small quantities of other elements notably including sulfur it is the largest source of fuel for generation of electricity worldwide as well as the largest worldwide source of carbon dioxide emissions which according to the ipcc contribute to climate change and global warming in terms of carbon dioxide emissions coal is slightly ahead of petroleum and about double that of natural gas1 coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining either underground mining or open pit mining surface mining as geological processes apply pressure to dead biotic matter over time under suitable conditions it is transformed successively into peat considered to be a precursor of coal it has industrial importance as a fuel in some countries for example ireland and finland lignite also referred to as brown coal is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for steamelectric power generation jet is a compact form of lignite that is sometimes polished and has been used as an ornamental stone since the iron age subbituminous coal whose properties range from those of lignite to those of bituminous coal and are used primarily as fuel for steamelectric power generation additionally it is an important source of light aromatic hydrocarbons for the chemical synthesis industry bituminous coal a dense mineral black but sometimes dark brown often with welldefined bands of bright and dull material used primarily as fuel in steamelectric power generation with substantial quantities also used for heat and power applications in manufacturing and to make coke anthracite the highest rank a harder glossy black coal used primarily for residential and commercial space heating it may be divided further in to metamorphically altered bituminous coal and petrified oil as from the deposits in pennsylvania graphite technically the highest rank but difficult to ignite and is not so commonly used as fuel it is mostly used in pencils and when powdered as a lubricant openpit mining also known as opencast mining and opencut mining refers to a method of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow the term is used to differentiate this form of mining from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth openpit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rock are found near the surface that is where the overburden surface material covering the valuable deposit is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunneling as would be the case for sand cinder and gravel for minerals that occur deep below the surfacewhere the overburden is thick or the mineral occurs as veins in hard rock underground mining methods extract the valued material openpit mines that produce building materials are commonly referred to as quarries people in some englishspeaking countries are unlikely to make a distinction between an openpit mine and other types of opencast mines such as quarries borrows placers and strip mines openpit mines are typically enlarged until either the mineral resource is exhausted or an increasing ratio of overburden to ore makes further mining uneconomic when this occurs the exhausted mines are sometimes converted to landfills for disposal of solid wastes however some form of water control is usually required to keep the mine pit from becoming a lake after mining finishes the mine area must undergo rehabilitation waste dumps are contoured to flatten them out to further stabilise them if the ore contains sulfides it is usually covered with a layer of clay to prevent access of rain and oxygen from the air which can oxidise the sulfides to produce sulfuric acid a phenomenon known as acid mine drainage this is then generally covered with soil and vegetation is planted to help consolidate the material eventually this layer will erode but it is generally hoped that the rate of leaching or acid will be slowed by the cover such that the environment can handle the load of acid and associated heavy metals there are no long term studies on the success of these covers due to the relatively short time in which large scale open pit mining has existed it may take hundreds to thousands of years for some waste dumps to become acid neutral and stop leaching to the environment the dumps are usually fenced off to prevent livestock denuding them of vegetation the open pit is then surrounded with a fence to prevent access and it generally

toothpaste is a colour additive for drugs and cosmetics is used to create casts and is used as a soil additive to improve the soils workability give up the answer is hydrous calcium sulphate commonly known as gypsum gypsum is a common sedimentary rock it is very soft one of the predominant traits of this rock family due to its softness it has little value as a building material however humans use this stone for everything from fertilizer to plastics because of its other useful properties one of the major characteristics of gypsum is its softness on the mohs hardness scale gypsum only earns a 2 rating in fact the word gypsum comes from the greek word for chalk when it becomes dehydrated its softness allows the mineral to easily crumble into a chalklike substance for this reason gypsum often was used for sculptures as long ago as ancient egypt in modern times gypsum forms the basis of sculpting materials like plaster of paris gypsum mainly occurs as a crystal in nature these crystals grow either in long fibers or large masses some of the fibers grow to great lengths especially in arid conditions creating crystalline shapes up to 39 feet long most gypsum is transparent but a prized variety has a slightly white shade this is alabaster a stone used for artistic purposes alabaster occurs in many types of artwork from small ornamental boxes to great sculptures gypsum primarily is made up of sulfur this is due to the evaporative process that creates the mineral by the start of the 19th century farmers realized that adding sulfur to the soil helped plants to grow therefore many used crumbled gypsum as a natural fertilizer in fact american farmers became so desperate to get this fertilizer that it led to a smuggling trade with nova scotia which caused the war of 1812 modern fertilizers still use gypsum and it is still an ingredient for many types of plaster there are multiple gypsum mines all over the world due to the demand of this mineral by modern industry while gypsum has a practical purpose it is also quite lovely in its natural form many rock collectors preserve gypsum crystals simply for the beauty of the stone geology history of gypsum in the area provided by the grand river heritage mines society from rest acres road the land slopes down to the east and south to the grand river and whitemans creek during and after the ice age several shoreline levels were formed as the waters receded and the water levels changed as a result terraces and steep slopes were formed which lead to the flat flood plains the upper levels are composed of flat fields welldrained because of the deep deposits of sand and gravel left by the glaciers and melting streams during the retreat of the last glacier the wisconsin extensive lowland areas were submerged in glacial lakes this is where the sand and clay plains of brant county were formed the gypsum mines were located where the bedrock was exposed in the valleys of the rivers as shown in this diagram as the glaciers retreated and the climate warmed plants and animals appeared moving up from the south gypsum was exploited in our area by the early settlers there were several mines and mills located in the paris area at first early settlers used picks and shovels to dig it out of the banks along the grand and nith rivers there in the valley where the bedrock was exposed pioneers who settled along the river found deposits of the whitish rock they dug shallow canals beside the river for water power and built mills beside them to grind the grain they grew to make grist and flour and land plaster other settlers opened their own mines or leased their mining rights to businessmen who had the land plaster hauled to the mills to be ground and sold to area fanners neighbouring settlers bought gypsum from them to use as a soil conditioner and fertilizer they used gypsum to plaster their interior walls and to stucco their homes exteriors other uses of gypsum were discovered later on the torrance mine the torrance mine is the only intact mine in the paris area today and it was first prospected in 1846 in the bureau of mines report of 1895 and 1896 it is written on lot 16 in the first concession of the township of brantford one mile east of paris on the north side of the grand river a new opening for plaster was being made the property comprising 133 acres is owned by mr john torrance of paris and occupied by mr william hynes as tenant who is an old miner who in company with james wright another miner had driven a shaft from the brink of the river north 45 feet at the date of my visit november 27th limited prospecting had been done at the place of opening some 50 years ago but the work was abandoned and nothing further done until the present year along the drift some excellent specimens of plaster were obtained intermingled with slate the extremity of the drift was in clay it was the intention i was told to advance the work much farther in the same line with the expectation of intercepting the regular layer of plaster congratulations to thebruce0 on the ftf

the cave in the mid 1800s once sustained a thriving tourist trade visitors arrived by the trainload to see the natural wonder once billed as the worlds largest cave entrance by the 1940s pollution had cut off not only the drinking water provided by the subterranean river which rushes through hidden river cave but also the streams of tourists the cave attracted the caves restoration in 1993 was one of the most remarkable environmental success stories in america and a breath of fresh air for horse cave today horse cave kentucky is a constant reminder of the delicate balance between caves and the sunlit world above after dr thomas death in 1948 his wife carrie steen thomas continued to operate floyd collins crystal cave the management of the thomas caves then passed down to dr thomas daughter ruth and her husband dr e r pohl dr pohl was a geologist whose contributions to the origin evolution and nature of the physiography and karst features were well known dr g a thomas began showing horse cave hidden river cave around the turn of the 20th century in 1916 his son dr harry thomas pioneered techniques for illuminating kentucky caves by installing electric lights in hidden river cave which he opened for tours subsequently he opened mammoth onyx cave in 1921 with one tour and purchased floyd collins crystal cave in what is now mammoth cave national park where two tours were shown from 1927 until 1943 a total of five different tours showing a variety of cave features unequalled anywhere were available in the three caves his success was largely a factor of making the caves easily accessible dr thomas grandson bill austin returned from college in the early 1950s and utilized his engineering skills to improve the lighting circuits in mammoth onyx cave and to install kentuckys first highvoltage cave lighting distribution system in floyd collins crystal cave bill austins legendary caving exploits were greatly influenced by jim dyer manager of floyd collins crystal cave following in the footsteps of floyd collins jim dyers postworld war ii cave exploration led the way to the discovery of many miles of passageways both dyer and austin were pioneers in the field of 35mm us cave photography their beautiful photographs of floyd collins crystal cave focused national attention on the cave as the size of the cave became known a steady stream of volunteer explorers began studying the cave in the 1950s leading to the creation of the cave research foundation crf crf explorations during the 1960s and 1970s led to connections between floyd collins crystal cave and mammoth cave those connections have since resulted in a cave system that is now the worlds longest more than 350 miles long the geology of hidden river cave hidden river cave is located in hart county kentucky home to some of the longest caves in the world the green river flows through the middle of hart county and drains most of the surrounding countryside most of the rainwater that falls here flows underground through sinkholes and caves and into the green river by way of springs five of the ten largest springs in kentucky are in hart county the water in hidden river cave however flows into the green river through the largest spring in kentucky the river that can be seen on the cave tour at hidden river cave follows winding cave passages for many miles before it finally flows into the green river and reenters the daylight world caves form in a terrain known as karst approximately 40 of kentucky is composed of karst karst areas are characterized by natural features such as caves sinkholes sinking streams underground streams and other solutional features rocks such as limestone dolomite gypsum or marble underlie most karstlands these rocks are called solutional rocks because they can be dissolved by acidic rainwater to form caves shell fragments found in limestone are evidence that the rock was formed by the accumulation of layer upon layer of sediment on a shallow sea floor these seas covered most of kentucky more than 300 million years ago the accumulated layers of sediment eventually hardened to form the underlying bedrock eventually the sea receded and the land uplifted allowing the downward flow of rainwater to begin dissolving the bedrock to form caves kentuckys groundwater has been constantly at work dissolving limestone for millions of years hidden river cave is much younger than the surrounding rock it is probably only a few million years old a mere baby in geologic time in this time span groundwater has had plenty of time to dissolve many miles of

cave are on the right information for this earthcache has been provided by the owners of the cave at their request why do i ask for a face in the picture of the earthcacher finding any of my earthcaches a face shot is the same as a signature in a log book many geocachers feel in order to get a find you must sign the log book period earthcaching is special and a human face is the same as a signature in a log book i do not accept hand shots pictures of a hand with gps because it does not show whos really visiting the ecs i set up for all to enjoy besides there is no log book for you to sign at a earthcache for anyone who doesnt want to post a picture of their face then log the find as a note or dont do it at all nobody is forcing anyone to come and visit any of my earthcaches i could argue that signing a log at a traditional cache is violating my personal rights because i have to sign a piece of paper maybe someone will forge my signature and steal my identity an argument that a photo violates a persons identity is foolish geocaching is a social activity eventually someone will meet you and know you are geocaching if you want to live a secretive life then geocaching is not the place to do so cache on do not log this ec unless you have answered the questions and have a picture ready to post logs with no photo of the actual cacher logging the find or failure to answer questions or negative comments will result in a log deletion without notice exceptions will be considered if you contact me first i realize sometimes we forget our cameras or the batteries die you must post a photo at the time of logging your find if your picture is not ready then wait until you have a photo sources of information for the earthcache quoted from the cumberland national historic park i have used sources available to me by using google search to get information for this earth cache i am by no means a geologist i use books internet and ask questions about geology just like 999 percent of the geocachers who create these great earth caches i enjoy earth caches and want people to get out and see what i see every time i go and explore this great place we live in

most abundant while coeymans limestone can be seen in the upper portion of the cave near the entrance coeymans limestone is more difficult to dissolve than the manlius variety so the water naturally chose a lower path through the manlius layer as a result almost perfectly flat ceilings can be seen in parts of the cavern which are actually the underside of the coeymans limestone layer rondout waterred is the creamcolored rock that runs along the underground stream scientists believe all of these rock layers were laid down by the ancient extinct sea during the silurian and devonian periods of our earths formation they are all sedimentary rock formed by layers of deposits that settled out of a body of water which then were compressed into solid rock to give you an idea of the age of these rocks scientists estimate the silurian age began about 435 million years ago and ended when the devonian age began around 395 million years ago while there are a few fossils visible in the cavern walls the main fossil beds lie in the layers of limestone above the cavern ceiling this means the rock from which howe caverns is carved is older than most fossils but the building process in howe caverns is never done nature is still hard at work in the great cave proven by the fact we still hear see and feel the droplets of water falling from the walls and ceilings always changing the caverns face it changes so slowly that the smudges left by smoking torches nearly a century ago can still be seen on the glowing flowstone walls today stalactites stalagmites and flowstone once the ancient subterranean stream cut its path through the limestone layers marvelous formations called stalactites stalagmites and flowstone began to form these unique stone formations grow at an unbelievably slow rate only about one cubic inch about the size of a small ring box will form in 100 years when rainwater seeps down through the soil above it picks up a very very small amount of limestone as it travels in fact there is only about a teaspoon of limestone dissolved in every gallon of rainwater that filters through the surface above the caverns as this rainwater drips slowly through the caves roof the droplets of water evaporate leaving behind tiny amounts of limestone on the cavern ceiling in this way stalactites grow downward from the vaulted cavern roof particle by particle over the course of millions of years the stone formations which grow up from the cavern floor are created in the same manner sometimes large droplets of water filtering through the cave roof do not have time to evaporate before they roll down a stalactite and drip off to the cave floor below thats why stalagmites usually form directly below stalactites and continue to grow up and up as more droplets fall from above in some cases such as the grand pipe organ formation at howe caverns stalactites and stalagmites will actually grow together to form columns by the way its easy to remember the difference between stalactites and stalagmites the word stalactites contains the letter c like the word ceiling stalagmite uses the letter g and so does the word ground stalactites grow from cavern ceilings while stalagmites grow upward from the ground flowstone is formed in much the same way as stalactites and stalagmites except the water flows down the cavern walls this wonderful rock formation resembles sheets of frozen rippling ice other minerals in the water that carry the limestone give flowstone stalactites and stalagmites their colors with the exception of the colors created by lights in the cavern all of the colors you see at howe caverns are completely natural rustcolored formations are caused by the presence of iron in the dripping water green is from waterborne copper gray indicates the presence of aluminum oxide yellow and bronze are from dissolved sulphur pure calcite makes milky translucent white formations to log this earth cache you must post

description two gas and coal dust explosions the first at approximately 1145 am march 9 1976 and the second at approximately 1130 pm march 111976 occurred in the 2 southeast main area of the scotia mine scotia coal company ovenfork letcher county kentucky all 15 men working in the 2 southeast main area at the time of the first explosion died as a result of the explosion ninetyone men in other parts of the mine at that time reached the surface without mishap at the time of the second explosion 13 men were underground near the entrance of 2 southeast main 11 died as the result of the explosion and 2 repairmen working a short distance outby escaped without injury msha mine rescuers were flown in by the air force to the scene mesa investigators believe that the first explosion originated near no 31 crosscut in 2 southeast main when a mixture of methane and air was ignited by an electric arc or spark from a batterypowered locomotive forces of the explosion spread to all five 2 southeast main entries extended into 2 left section off 2 southeast main and dissipated as they reached the northeast main junction mesa investigators believe that the second explosion originated near the entrance of or in 2 left section off 2 southeast main when a methaneair mixture was ignited by one of five possible sources an electric arc or spark from a batteryequipped deluge system three batteryequipped telephones scoop batteries residual fires or a frictional spark from a fall of mine roof on a roofbolting machine the forces of the explosion extended throughout 2 left section and all five entries of 2 southeast main spread north and south in all entries in both panels of northeast main and dissipated near the junction of 3 southeast main in the northern direction and near the junction of southeast main in the southern direction general information the scotia mine scotia coal company is located near ovenfork in letcher county kentucky on the poor fork of the cumberland river approximately 14 miles northeast of cumberland harlan county kentucky the scotia coal company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the blue diamond coal company knoxville tennessee the scotia mine was started in july 1962 it was originally opened by nine slope entries into the imboden coalbed which averages 72 inches in thickness locally the slope entries were developed into the coalbed and inclined due to the pitching characteristics of the coalbed from its outcrop in 1975 an additional opening in the form of a concrete lined 135foot diameter shaft 376 feet deep was raisebored near the face areas of northeast main the lining of the shaft was completed july 21 1975 and work was begun to install an automatic elevator on march 9 1976 such work had not been completed and the shaft was being used only as an intake air opening of 310 employees 275 worked underground on two coal producing shifts and one maintenance shift per day 5 days a week approximately 2500 tons of coal were produced daily on six active sections consisting of five continuous mining sections and one conventional mining section numerous tests by the bureau of mines have established that coal dust having a volatile ratio of 012 and higher is explosive the volatile ratio of the coal in 2 southeast main is 0395 the last federal inspection of the entire mine was completed on february 27 1976 on march 8 1976 on the evening shift a federal coal mine inspector conducted a health and safety technical inspection of 2 left section off 2 southeast main the explosion on the morning of the explosion march 9 1976 the day shift 700 am 300 pm crew of 106 men entered the mine and were transported to their working areas by batterypowered portabuses and locomotives of the 106 men underground 13 were in 2 southeast main and 2 left section off 2 southeast main explosion area of those 13 men nine men under the supervision of virgil coots section foreman were producing coal in 2 left section two men were building overcasts at the mouth of 2 left and one man was tending the 2 left belthead located at the mouth of 2 left in no 22 crosscut between nos 2 and 3 entries of 2 southeast main according to his testimony at the official hearings on the morning of the explosion j p feltner underground construction foreman called richard combs general mine foreman about 730 am after all the mantrips and men had entered the mine and told combs that he would have a load of steel rails delivered from 1 right off 2 east to 2 southeast main combs and feltner had discussed delivery of the load of rails to 2 southeast main several days prior when combs had expressed a need to extend the track in 2 southeast main preparatory to reactivating the section after feltner arranged to have a motor crew pick up the rails and deliver them to 2 southeast main he traveled to 2 left section in search of a rail bender and oxygenacetylene tanks he stated that james bentley was with him while he was in 2 left section feltner did not make tests for methane or take air measurements while he was in this area of the mine nor did he go inby 2 left section feltner stated that there was no check curtain across the track going into 2 left but he observed a piece of plastic along the track on the mine floor between nos 2 and 3 entries near where the check curtain was supposed to have been hung he stated that he was unaware at that time that the absence of a check curtain at this location caused a short circuit of the air current which was ventilating 2 southeast main inby 2 left feltner left the 2 southeast main area and traveled to the mouth of northeast main where he met the motor crew with a load of rails the motor crew operating the nos 6 and 8 batterypowered locomotives had stopped at the charging station at the mouth of northeast main to charge the batteries on the no6 locomotive feltner stated that two locomotives were used to transport the load of rails because the batteries on the no6 locomotive were discharged and only one set of trucks was operating the no8 locomotive the no6 locomotive a 7ton goodman equipped with an air compressor for the pneumatic braking system was operated by roy mcknight the no8 locomotive an 8ton westinghouse equipped with a mechanical braking system was operated by lawrence peavey the two locomotives were coupled and the truck load of rails was in front coupled to the no8 locomotive feltner stated that the motor crew left the mouth of northeast main pushing the truck load of rails toward 2 southeast main about 1135 am he stated that it would have taken the motor crew about 10 minutes to reach 2 southeast main inby 2 left section he stated that the motor crew did not have gas detecting equipment and that he had not at any time instructed them to make any tests or examinations of 2 southeast main inby 2 left before entering the area he thought that the area inby 2 left had been preshift examined because it was on intake air feltner stated that he left the mouth of northeast main at the same time as the motor crew and traveled to southeast main where some of his crew were setting timbers along the track haulage road approximately 800 feet inby the southeast main belt drive shortly after he arrived at this location at approximately 1145 am he felt a gust of air moving outby opposite to the ventilating currents normal direction and observed rock dust in suspension he thought that the gust might have been caused by a crushed out stopping outby and he took his crew to investigate they had traveled outby about 600 feet when the ventilating current reversed to normal direction after feltner learned that an explosion had occurred he contacted all active sections of the mine except 2 left off 2 southeast main according to his testimony given at the official hearings james bentley made an inspection of the abandoned 2 left section off northeast main on the morning of the explosion he found that a regulator was open approximately four feet wider than he had originally set it after the section was abandoned after completing his inspection of this section he returned to the regulator and closed it to the original position he took an air measurement and then walked to the no3 belt drive in northeast main near the entrance of 3 southeast main where a telephone was located he called lawrence cohen section foreman in the left panel southeast main and advised cohen of his location bentley asked cohen to take an air measurement on the left panel and call back bentley then called virgil coots section foreman in the 2 left section off 2 southeast main and told coots that he had inspected 3 southeast right panel northeast main northeast main and 2 left section off northeast main bentley told coots that he found the regulator in 2 left section off northeast main open about four feet wider than it was supposed to be and that his closing of the regulator to its original position should increase the ventilation on 2 left section off 2 southeast main bentley asked coots how much air did he have and coots replied that he had just lost his air coots told bentley that he would go out to the mouth of 2 left section where two men were building overcasts and determine if the men had removed a stopping which could have shortcircuited the ventilation approximately two minutes later about 1145 am the explosion occurred the motor crew delivering the truck load of rails had reached their destination at the end of the track in 2 southeast main when the explosion occurred including the two locomotive operators there were 15 men in the 2 southeast main area when the explosion occurred all died as a result of the explosion recovery operations according to available evidence when the explosion occurred john hackworth belthead attendant was at the 2 southeast main belt drive located in no 3 entry left panel northeast main he was rolled a short distance by the forces of the explosion from 2 southeast main but was not seriously injured he immediately called the surface and reported what had happened failing to establish communications with anyone in 2 southeast main hackworth donned his selfrescuer and proceeded into 2 southeast main to investigate reportedly he traveled approximately 2200 feet without making contact with anyone before he was forced to retreat federal inspectors west sample and bowman entered the mine with two rescue teams equipped with selfcontained breathing equipment at approximately 430 pm after the fresh air base had been established recovery and rescue efforts inby the fresh air base were accomplished by mine rescue teams under oxygen the first body was discovered by a mine rescue team at 10 18 pm at no 22 crosscut in no2 entry of 2 southeast main approximately 50 feet inby the 2 left belt drive the nos 2 3 and 4 bodies were found in the nos 1 and 2 entries of 2 southeast main near the entrance of 2 left section the nos 5 6

constructed barricade evidence indicated that some effort had been made to construct a barricade by hanging a plastic check across the mouth of no5 entry however the left side of the check was not fastened to the rib when discovered by the rescue team about 120 am march 10 the last two bodies were found in no4 entry of 2 southeast main near the battery locomotives located between nos 31 and 32 crosscuts j b holbrook don creech don polly james sturgill monroe sturgill james williams john hackworth and glen barker scotia employees and grover tussey richard sammons and kenneth kiser federal coal mine inspectors were in the vicinity of the roofbolting machine and collins and parker were in the process of removing the coupler from the pump trailing cable when another explosion occurred in the 2 southeast main area at approximately 1130 pm collins and parker heard the explosion and then felt pressure and heat the atmosphere became so dusty that their visibility was limited to about 12 inches they put on their selfrescuers found a telephone line and holding to each other followed it to the main line track they continued holding to each other and followed the telephone cables out the track entry toward the surface they arrived at the junction of northeast and southeast main before visibility improved sufficiently for them to recognize their surroundings after arriving at the northeast main belt head parker called the surface supply house reported the explosion and asked for transportation they proceeded out the track entry when they arrived at the mouth of 1 west they heard someone paging them on the mine telephone and parker answered he was told that transportation was on the way and to wait at that point they however continued out the track entry to about onehalf mile from the surface where they were met by richard combs and federal coal mine inspector davis who transported them to the surface approximately 945 am west merritt and mcknight were withdrawn from the mine shaft the nos 1 and 2 westmoreland coal company and the national mine corporation mine rescue teams and clemons were lowered into the shaft clemons briefed the mine rescue teams at the bottom of the shaft the westmoreland teams were instructed to travel along the northeast main track entry open face in intake air toward 2 southeast main the national mine corporation rescue team was instructed to stay at the bottom of the shaft as a backup team the bethelkhorn team was standing by on the surface one of the westmoreland teams arrived at the mouth of 2 southeast main approximately 12 oclock noon march 12 and found 11 bodies after determining that there were no signs of life the teams were ordered to return to the surface without recovering the bodies because of the possibility of another explosion all persons were returned to the surface by 1 02 pm all parties concurred that the chance of another explosion was too great to permit anyone to reenter the mine and a consensus decision was reached to seal the mine on the surface preparations to seal began immediately and all openings had been closed by 210 pm march 19 1976 at 210 pm on march 15 1976 a 104a order was issued

actually not what we would call a cave the term rock shelter is pretty descriptive the term abri is the french word for rock shelter which is often used in scientific papers this is simply because of the fact that in early 20th century when the first important archaeologic discoveries were made in rock shelters they were concentrated to central france so the term abri became an international scientific term a rock shelter is not at all what most people associate with a cave a dark confined space where sunlight does not reach but rock shelter actually do fit the definition of a cave rock shelters are formed by erosion if there are weaker and stronger rocks the weaker rocks will erode faster and form indentations if the layers are horizontal the indentation will be a ledge this is a common situation with all kinds of sedimentary rocks so rock shelters are common in any kind of sedimentary rock they are most common with sandstones and with interbedded limestones and marls a second kind of erosion forming rock shelters is the force of the sea and of rivers in both cases the force of the water works on the rock and causes the normally horizontal indentation just by concentrating its energy at the same point for quite some time the kind of rock and its weakness are not important for this process when the land is elevated from the sea or when the river continues to cut deeper the rock shelter will become a fine living place and finally there are lots of rock shelters formed by karst processes they are the remains of eroded karst caves cave ruins which are often described as the last stage of cave development a former cave which was much bigger is slowly destroyed by ongoing erosion the ceiling collapses and only the concave walls remain of a vaulted dome often the former caves can be recognized as caves by the remains of speleothems the most important rock shelter of the world are located in france the abris along the vezere valley in the perigord this is the place where abris were discovered for archaeologic research many locations are actually typesites or type locale for archaeologic eras famous are also the cliff dwellings of the mesa verde national park in the usa then there are the important dwellings and cave entrances of the lone and blau valleys in southern germany where the oldest artworks of mankind were discovered a cave is a natural opening in the ground extending beyond the zone of light and large enough to permit the entry of man occurring in a wide variety of rock types and caused by widely differing geological processes caves range in size from single small rooms to interconnecting passages many miles long the scientific study of caves is called speleology from the greek words spelaion for cave and logos for study it is a composite science based on geology hydrology biology and archaeology and thus holds special interest for earth scientists of the us geological survey caves have been natural attractions since prehistoric times prolific evidence of early mans interest has been discovered in caves scattered throughout the world fragments of skeletons of some of the earliest manlike creatures australopithecines have been discovered in cave deposits in south africa and the first evidence of primitive neanderthal man was found in a cave in the neander valley of germany cromagnon man created his remarkable murals on the walls of caves in southern france and northern spain where he took refuge more than 10000 years ago during the chill of the ice age sandstone caves are shallow caves that

GC565MZ,37.02353,-94.51743,Type.earthcache,the geology karst topography karst topography is a geological formation shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite subterranean drainage may limit surface water with few to no rivers or lakes many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes being the most common however distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by glacial debris or confined by one or more superimposed nonsoluble rock strata some karst regions include thousands of caves although evidence of caves large enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst types and formation a cave or cavern is a hollow place in the ground especially natural underground space large enough for a human to enter caves form naturally by the weathering of rock and often extend deep underground solution caves solutional caves are the most frequently occurring caves and such caves form in rock that is soluble such as limestone but can also form in other rocks including chalk dolomite marble salt and gypsum rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through beddingplanes faults joints and so on over geological epochs cracks expand to become caves and cave systems primary caves caves formed at the same time as the surrounding rock are called primary caves lava tubes are formed through volcanic activity and are the most common primary caves as lava flows downhill its surface cools and solidifies hot liquid lava continues to flow under that crust and if most of it flows out a hollow tube remains examples of such caves can be found in the canary islands jejudo the basaltic plains of eastern idaho and other places kazumura cave near hilo hawaii is a remarkably long and deep lava tube it is 656 km long 408 mi how caves form cave formation begins when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it falls through the atmosphere rain water must have carbon dioxide to become acidic it must be acidic to chemically react to the limestone bedrock rainwater is absorbed by the soil into the ground as rainwater comes through the soil it absorbs more carbon dioxide that is being produced by plants that are dead this changes the ground water to a weaker form of carbonic acid h2o + co2 = h2co3 as it travels down through the ground it comes to solid rock when the rock is limestone or dolomite caves can form the water reacts chemically with limestone and slowly a larger and larger space will form this happens because the rocks are made of calcium carbonate caco3 this is what you call chemical erosion as the space becomes larger and larger the water can flow through as it flows it erodes physical erosion washes away rock and sand this is what makes a cave larger and forms an underground stream finally over hundreds of thousands of years or even millions of years the cave is formed rocks elements minerals and crystals rocks go through cycles types of rocks sedimentary sedimentary rocks are formed by sediment that is deposited over time usually as layers at the bottom of lakes and oceans this sediment can include minerals small pieces of plants and other organic matter the sediment is compressed over a long period of time before consolidating into solid layers of rock sedimentary rocks form layers called strata which can often be seen in exposed cliffs sedimentary rocks cover the majority of the earths rocky surface but only make up a small percentage of the earths crust compared to metamorphic and igneous types of rocks some examples of sedimentary rocks include limestone sandstone mudstone greywacke chalk coal claystone and flint limestone forms the metamorphic rock marble when subjected to extreme heat and pressure over time metamorphism sandstone forms the metamorphic rock quartzite mudstone forms the metamorphic rock slate chalk is a soft white form of limestone flint is a hard sedimentary form of the mineral quartz chert is a finegrained silicarich microcrystalline cryptocrystalline or microfibrous sedimentary rock that may contain small fossils it varies greatly in color from white to black but most often manifests as gray brown grayish brown and light green to rusty red its color is an expression of trace elements present in the rock and both red and green are most often related to traces of iron logging requirements do not post answers in your log send the following answers to me via email the text gc565mz joplin cave on

look at how limestone caves are formed and their relationship to karst topography cave formation and the karst environment limestone caves are formed by erosion as rainwater falls through the atmosphere it absorbs co2 creating carbonic acid this slightly acidic rainwater erodes limestone flowing water above or below the surface which has become slightly acidic dissolves the calcium in limestone to form caves after the water has receded lower water table pockets andor rooms are exposed after the room is formed and the water receded the rainwater that has percolated through the ground drips off the roof of the cave some of the calcite from the limestone is deposited and this eventually forms a stalactite where it hits the floor of the cave it becomes a stalagmite unfortunately if the keyhole cave once had either stalactites or stalagmites they are not present today maybe in unexplored regions they can still be found but as we said before it is not necessary to enter the cave to complete the find of this earthcache karst topography and cave formation a point of confusion regarding caves is that many people think since most limestone caves are found in a karst environment then limestone and karst caves are one in the same that is not correct there are both limestone caves that are not karst caves and karst caves which are not in limestone most people use limestone and karst caves synonymously why it is because the vast majority of the caves on earth are limestone karst caves karst caves are formed by water solution in any watersoluble rock not just limestone among the other substances and rocks that are soluble and form karst caves are ice salt gypsum and even quartzite and granite all of these type caves are called karst caves for the record the keyhole cave is a karst limestone cave at this point you may be asking why are there so many karst limestone caves the answer is rather easy limestone is a very common rock and the forming of karst in soluble rock is also very common limestone is a very common sedimentary rock formed by the remains of all kinds of animals the other soluble rocks need special climates for their forming limestone is produced nearly everywhere in the world after the exposure of the limestone it is subject to weathering which typically means the development of an karst area by the way an acceptable definition of a karst topography or environment is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite but not exclusively limestone or dolomite often karst regions display distinctive surface features such as sinkholes or dolines being the most common see the above paragraph there are several large sink holes close to the keyhole cave as well as the nearby bundy cave the keyhole cave just inside other than its beauty there is not a lot known about the history of the keyhole cave most of what is known is wordofmouth and not written because of the very unique entrance the cave could give protection from large carnivores and human enemies to all who entered the only difficulty is while humans one at a time entered the cave their horses that probably had to remain on the outside were exposed to whatever that may mean harm when we mention unique entrance this is no exaggeration unlike the massive triangular opening of the bundy cave the opening into the keyhole cave is shaped like a keyhole with the wider part at the top and a very narrow passage at the bottom the lower passage way is serpentine and narrow with tight squeezes for all just a few dozen feet back on the outside of the cave makes it readily apparent how the cave got its name the best photo site is here little is known about the exploration of the keystone cave but according to the owner it has been entered many times and there are deep passages beyond the initial room found just past the entrance there are no bats known to inhabit the cave inside i call this the hornets nest in order for you to claim a find of the keystone cave you must complete the following 1 answer these questions a measure the entrance at the very bottom of the passageway b estimate the vertical height of the cave opening c is there a spring flowing into or out of the cave 2 post a photo with the cave entrance in the background while we would like it your face does not necessarily have to be in the picture all pets are acceptable models for the photo just dont turn them loose if they enter the cave you may never see them again

the gaspesie where you will find some of the higher moutains of this region those moutains are part of of a much bigger chain of moutains the appalachians the gaspesie was formed at the cambrien era 500 millions years ago and the devonian 400 millions years ago at the beginning the landmass is located in the south tropic in a supercontinent called rodinia there is an gigantic sea at its center the laptetus sea witch goes from the labrador to the golf of mexico a the end of the devonian the lapetus sea will contract under the mouvement of the continent by the end of the mesozoic era the appalachian mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain it was not until the region was uplifted during the cenozoic era that the distinctive topography of the present formed the birth of the appalachian mountain and other like them maybe explain by the mouvement of tectonic plates when the two plates collide the force witch they push against each other and the pressure building may cause the plates to move on top of each other in this case the part of the plate that rise will be the birth of a moutain rangeit took 150 millions of years to have what we can see of the appalachian moutains now as mention before the appalchalians were the results of a collision between two ancient continent the laurentia and the baltica the gaspesian part of the appalachian were born when the ancien oceanic floor and sedements that was accumating for millions of years rises from this plate collision the natural mountain building is called orogeny in this case the appalachian orogeny most copper produced is extracted from sulfide deposits copper copper is a ductile metal with great electric or heat conductivity pure copper is rather soft and flexible and a freshlyexposed surface has a pinkish or peachy color copper is part of igneous rock compound mineral mass are created when copper or other mineral are dissolved under extreme heat and pressure magma copper is then mix with other mineral its chemical structure slightly modified when the magma rise to the surface it get cooler then solidified igneous rocks between differents layers of rocks at different levels beneath the surface of the earth crust those igneous rocks can be intrusive or extrusive the rock is extrusive when the flow of magma reach the surface of the earth or the bottom of the ocean magma hardened at the surface the process is to be intrusive when the magma solidified under the earths surface or under the oceanic floor in general the grain of an extrusive rock will be much fine then the one of an intrusive rock the chalcopyrite is a double sulfure mineral copper35 and iron extremely common it is on of the most abondant of the four mineral above pyritecrazy gold chalcopyrite sphalerite galene copper can be found at its natural state in the ground native copper murdochville 1909 alfred miller de sunny bank discover in the york river rocks that contain copper 192122 the 5 miller brother go on an expedition to try to discover the source of the copper mineral they will stop their search near what i twill become later the miller and copper mountain 193840 noranda estimate that the copper reserve of the copper and needle mountains to 196 millions tons 1951 underground mine developpement work begin on the surface mine construction of the fondry budget is estimating at 35 millions dollars 1953 murdoch work camp become murdochville in july the city is name after the first president of noranda mr james murdoch more then 900 peoples are working at murdochville 195657 reserves of the gaspe copper mines are evaluated at 67 millions tons at a percentage of copper of 13 28 mars 2002 noranda closed the fondry murdochvilles mine tons of rocks were excavated to retrive the precious copper if you look at a bearing of 334 degre true you willsee that it almost fill the space between the two moutain once melted the metal was formed into anods then ship to montreal to be raffine copper anods contained also gold silver nickel an other metals how do we make copper first a furnace is preheated by burning natural gas copper concentrate minera lis added to the to furnace the furnace is so hot that the concentrate immediately ignite when mix with oxigen and silica sio2 flux silica is most commonly found in nature as sand or quartz at murdochville it was extract from the surface of the moutain see pic below the silica flux bind with the iron and other impurities and keeps them separate from the copper liquid copper and iron fall to the bottom of the furnace while the sulfur combine with oxigen to form sulfur dioxide gas the copper iron and silica form two layers at the bottom of the furnace the lighter top layer is a slag mostly ironsilica and other impurities in front of the interpretation center the is a small river look in each side of the river you will see small piece of slag its a dark brown color the bottom layer of mostly copper and some iron is called matte sulfur dioxide acid gas from the furnace is captured and mix with water in an adjacent acid plant to produce sulfuric acidlook to the rear of the interpretation center you can see the pipeline black pipe that was transporting the acid from the plant to the reservoir the converter furnace in the converter air is blown into the matte to burn away the iron and any remaining sulfur the result is called blister copper the anode furnace the blister in more 98 pure copper but contain too much oxygenthe anode furnace blows natural gas into the melt to burn off the oxygen copper is then poor into molds to make the anode to log this cache you will have to answer to the following 1 we know that the mine was exploited underground and above ground tell me what type of igneous rocks the minors

is posted on the cache page lewis wetzel cave located at 40 degrees 04 22 n latitude and 80 degrees 42 37 w longitude and at an elevation of 704 feet above sea level has a total surveyed length of 163 feet the cave is located 124 feet southeast of the hempfield tunnel of the baltimore and ohio railroad in east wheeling the 5 foot wide by 4 foot high entrance is in a sandstone cliff and reduces to a crawlway passage 2 feet wide by 2 feet high after 20 feet the entrance passage intersects the main cave perpendicularly forming a tshaped junction the passage to the right of the t junction extends along a bearing of s 55 degrees e for 17 feet and is 2 feet wide by 11 feet high this passage slopes upward to the base of a second entrance which is a pit this pit tapers to 2 feet by 2 feet at the

communication between this opening and the surface the loft which lies completely above the main room is reached by a narrow vertical shaft that is above the junction of the hideout and the main room to the south of the shaft the loft consists of a small vshaped room 2 feet wide by 2 feet high with each arm of the v about 10 feet long to the north of the shaft the loft consists of an lshaped

the southeast of and parallels the frst segment of the lshaped passage a small flowstone formation lies at the t junction the entire cave lies in sandstone of the conemaugh series of the pennsylvanian system the sandstone is probably lower pittsburgh bellaire sandstone lewis wetzel cave was formed by the faulting of this rock as a result of wheeling creek downcutting into its own valley font> lewis wetzel born 1763 died 1808 was a famous local indian fighter an accomplished woodsman and an expert rifle shot settlers in the wheeling area relied on him for years as a trustworthy scout he was an american frontiersman who became a famous folkhero in his own lifetime when his father and youngest brother were ambushed and killed by indians in 1787 wetzel went on a lifetime crusade against the red man to avenge their deaths legend has it that he hunted indians as if they were wild animals lewis wetzel was reported to have used lewis wetzel cave as a hiding place along an indian trail from which he shot eleven braves the following is an account of the best known legend about lewis wetzel and the cave in 1788 lewis wetzel made one of his occasional visits to wheeling where he visited his sisters in fort henry he soon learned of a turkeycall which had been plaguing everyone so much because it had been heard many times and many places thus giving the call a supernatural quality men had tried to find the source of the plaintive sound frequently never returned after hearing many different stories wetzel left the fort in search of the mysterious bird night fell as he searched the hills so needing a good vantage point he climbed to the fork of a tree the mournful cries soon came at intervals and at times seemed to be very close and then far off in the distance in the light of the moon he saw something pass silently through the brush up toward the top of the hill at dawn he descended from the tree and found some faint marks in the brush which led him sixty feet above the creek on the east side of creek hill where the trail ended suddenly here he found the mouth of a capacious cavern running he knew not how far underground the entrance almost completely obscured by a heavy growth of vines and foliage he hid in the brush and late in the afternoon a piercing turkeycall broke the silence the cries came from the cavern wetzel saw an indian slowly rise in the mouth of the cave and then twisting his mouth into a long hornlike shape the redskin sent forth the shrill prolonged and peculiarly distressing moaning cry wetzel raised his rifle and aimed carefully at the warriors head he pulled the trigger and ended the turkeycry forever it is said that wetzel killed 11 indians from this cave hide out after scalp was taken and the bodies were placed in this cave in his life time many say wetzel killed over 100 indians his best feet was to relaod and fire his gun during a full sprint this drew in many indians who were thinking that wezels rifle was empty note an

puzzle to find the exact location of the cache the lost dutchman gold mine also known by many similar names is reportedly a very rich gold mine hidden in the superstition mountains near apache junction east of phoenix arizona in the united states the land is a designated wilderness area and mining is now restricted there by title 16 chapter 23 paragraph 1133 of the united states code the mine is named after german immigrant jacob waltz dutchman was a common though inaccurate american slang term for german derived from the german word for german deutsch it is perhaps the most famous lost mine in american history arizona placename expert byrd granger notes that as of 1977 the lost dutchman story was printed or cited at least six times more often than two other fairly wellknown tales the story of captain kidds lost treasure and the story of the lost pegleg mine in california robert blair notes that people have been seeking the lost dutchman mine since at least 1892 while granger writes that according to one estimate 8000 people annually made some effort to locate the lost dutchmans mine former arizona attorney general bob corbin is among those who have looked for the mine others have argued the mine has little or no basis in fact and is a legend though as noted below blair argues that all the main components of the story have at least some basis in fact according to many versions of the tale the mine is either cursed or protected by enigmatic guardians who wish to keep the mines location a secret other lost dutchman mines blair writes that there have been at least four legendary lost dutchman gold mines in the american west including the famed superstition mine of jacob waltz one lost dutchman mine is said to be in colorado another in california two are said to be located in arizona tales of these other lost dutchman mines can be traced to at least the 1870s the earliest lost dutchman mine in arizona was said to have been near wickenburg about 180 km 110 mi northwest of the superstition mountains a dutchman was allegedly discovered dead in the desert near wickenburg in the 1870s alongside saddlebags filled with gold blair suggests that fragments of this legend have perhaps become attached to the mythical mine of jacob waltz what would seem to be a crucial detail is also in dispute as some allege that the socalled mine is actually a mine in the superstition mountains or is instead a hidden stockpile of gold ore andor bullion andor coins stories about the mine granger writes that fact and fiction blend in the tales but that there are three main elements to the story they are first tales of the lost apache gold or dr thornes mine second tales about the lost dutchman and third stories of the soldiers lost gold vein the most complete version of the lost dutchman story incorporates all three legends as noted below blair argues that there are kernels of truth at the heart of each of these three main stories though the popular story is often badly garbled from the actual account in 1977 granger identified 62 variants of the lost dutchman story some of the variations are minor but others are substantial casting the story in a very different light from the other versions keeping in mind that there are sometimes considerable variance between the tales below is a brief summary of each of the three stories identified by granger lost apache gold or dr thornes story in this story actually two interconnected stories members of the apache tribe are said to have a very rich gold mine located in the superstition mountains famed apache geronimo is sometimes mentioned in relation to this story in most variants of the story the family of a man called miguel peralta discovered the mine and began mining the gold there only to be attacked or massacred by apaches in about 1850 in the supposed peralta massacre years later a man called dr thorne treats an ailing or wounded apache often alleged to be a chieftain and is rewarded with a trip to a rich gold mine he is blindfolded and taken there by a circuitous route and is allowed to take as much gold ore as he can carry before again being escorted blindfolded from the site by the apaches thorne is said to be either unwilling or unable to relocate the mine the truth about the peralta mine blair insists that the peralta portion of the story is unreliable writing the operation of a gold mine in the superstitions by a peralta family is a contrivance of 20th century writers a man named miguel peralta and his family did in fact operate a successful mine in the 1860s but near valanciana california not in arizona the mine was quite profitable earning about $35000 in less than one year blair describes this as an unusually good return for such a small gold mine to earn in such a relatively brief period as of 1975 ruins of the peralta mine were standing however the peralta mine eventually became unprofitable and after the money was gone miguel peralta eventually turned to fraud dr george m willing jr paid peralta $20000 for the mining rights for an enormous swath of land about 3000000 acres 12000 km2 in southern arizona and new mexico based on a deed originally granted by the spanish empire in the 18th century trouble came after willing learned that the deed was entirely bogus despite his efforts willing was never able to recover the money he gave to peralta these deeds led to the basis of the james reavis arizona land swindle blair argues that this peralta story well known to arizona residents was eventually incorporated in the lost dutchman story in a severely distorted version following the renewed interest in the lost dutchmans mine in the 1930s the truth about dr thorne another detail which casts doubt on the story is the fact that according to blair there was never any dr thorne in the employ of the army or indeed of the federal government in the 1860s according to blair the origin of this story can be traced to a doctor named thorne who was in private practice in new mexico in the 1860s thorne claimed that he was taken captive by navajos in 1854 and that during his captivity he had discovered a rich gold vein thorne related his claims to three us soldiers in about 1858 the three soldiers set out to find the gold but without success over the decades this true tale was gradually absorbed into the lost dutchmans story the lost dutchmans story this tale involves two german men jacob waltz or weitz weitzer walls welz walz et cetera and jacob weiser however blair argues that there is a strong likelihood that there never was a second man named weiser but rather that a single person named waltz or a variant thereof was over the years turned into two men as the legend of the dutchman mine evolved blair contends that this story can be divided into hawk and dove versions depending on if the germans are said to behave violently or peacefully in most versions of the tale waltz andor weiser located a rich gold mine in the superstition mountains in many versions of the story they save or aid a member of the peralta family and are rewarded by being told the location of the mine weiser is attacked and wounded whether by marauding apaches or by a greedy waltz but survives at least long enough to tell a man called dr walker about the mine waltz is also said to make a deathbed confession to julia thomas and draws or describes a crude map to the gold mine see historical jacob waltz below for more information about the miner whose deathbed confession was the beginning of the legend of the lost dutchman mine stories of the soldiers lost gold vein in yet another version of the tale two or more us army soldiers are said to have discovered a vein of almost pure gold in or near the superstition mountains the soldiers are alleged to have presented some of the gold but to have been killed or to have vanished soon after this account is usually dated to about 1870 according to blair the story may have its roots in the efforts of three us soldiers to locate gold in an area of new mexico based on an allegedly true story related to them by dr thorne of new mexico see above the historical jacob waltz a view of superstition mountains in lost dutchman state park blair cites ample evidence of the historical jacob waltz and suggests that there is additional evidence that supports the core elements of the story as related above that waltz did in fact claim to have discovered or at least heard the story of a rich gold vein or cache but blair suggests that this core story was distorted in subsequent retellings comparing the many variants of the lost dutchmans story to the game of chinese whispers where the original account is distorted in multiple retellings of the tale there was indeed a jacob waltz who immigrated to the us from germany the earliest documentation of him in the us is an 1848 affidavit in which waltz declared himself to be about 38 years old a man called jacob walz was born in september 1810 in wurttemberg blair suggests that this waltz could be the same waltz who later came to be regarded as the legendary dutchman and that he changed the spelling of his surname to better match its pronunciation waltz relocated to arizona in the 1860s and stayed in the state for most of the rest of his life he pursued mining and prospecting but seems to have had little luck with either in 1870 waltz had a homestead of about 160 acres 065 km2 near phoenix where he operated a farm there was a catastrophic flooding in phoenix in 1891 and waltzs farm was one of many that were devastated afterwards waltz fell ill he was rumored to have contracted pneumonia during the flooding he died on october 25 1891 after having been nursed by an acquaintance named julia thomas she was usually described as a quadroon blair suggests that there is little doubt that waltz did in fact relate to thomas the location of an alleged gold mine as early as september 1 1892 the arizona enterprise was reporting on the efforts of thomas and several others to locate the lost mine whose location was told to her by waltz after this was unsuccessful thomas and her partners were reported to be selling maps to the mine for $7 each the death of adolph ruth were it not for the death of amateur explorer and treasure hunter adolph ruth the story of the lost dutchmans mine would have likely been little more than a footnote in arizona history as one of hundreds of lost mines rumored to be in the american west ruth disappeared while searching for the mine in the summer of 1931 his skull with two bullet holes in it was recovered about half a year after he vanished and the story made national news thus sparking widespread interest in the lost dutchmans mine in a story that echoes some of the earlier tales ruths son erwin c ruth was said to have learned of the peralta mine from a man called pedro gonzales or gonzalez according to the story in about 1912 erwin c ruth gave some legal aid to gonzales saving him from almost certain imprisonment in gratitude gonzales told erwin about the peralta mine in the superstition mountains even reportedly passing on some antique maps of the site gonzales claimed to be descended from the peralta family on his mothers side erwin passed the information to his father adolph who had a longstanding interest in lost mines and amateur exploration in fact the elder ruth had fallen and badly broken several bones while seeking the lost pegleg mine in california he had metal pins in his leg and used a cane to help him walk in june 1931 ruth decided to finally try and locate the lost peralta mine after traveling to the region ruth stayed several days at the ranch of tex barkely and prepared for his expedition barkely repeatedly urged ruth to abandon his search for the mine the treacherous terrain of the superstition mountains could be difficult for experienced outdoorsmen let alone for the semilame 66yearold ruth however ruth ignored barkelys advice and set out for a two week stint in the mountains ruth did not return as scheduled and no trace of him could be found after a brief search in december 1931 the arizona republic reported on the recent discovery of a human skull in the superstition mountains to determine if the skull was ruths it was examined by dr alea hrdlicka a wellrespected anthropologist who was also given several photos of ruth along with ruths dental records as curt gentry writes dr hrdlicka positively identified the skull as that of adolph ruth he further stated after examining the two holes in the skull that it appeared that a shotgun or highpowered rifle had been fired through the head at almost pointblank range making the small hole when the bullet entered and the large hole when it exited in january 1932 human remains were discovered about threequarters of a mile 121 km from where the skull had been found though the remains had been scattered by scavengers they were undoubtedly ruths many of ruths personal effects were found at the scene including a pistol not missing any shells and the metal pins used to mend his broken bones but the map to the peralta mine was said to be missing tantalizingly ruths checkbook was also recovered and proved to contain a note written by ruth wherein he claimed to have discovered the mine and gave detailed directions ruth ended his note with the phrase veni vidi vici authorities in arizona did not convene a criminal inquest regarding ruths death they argued that ruth had likely succumbed to thirst or heart disease though as gentry writes one official went so far as to suggest that adolph ruth might have committed suicide while this theory did not ignore the two holes in the skull it did fail to explain how ruth had managed to remove and bury the empty shell then reload his gun after shooting himself through the head blair notes that the conclusion of arizona authorities was rejected by many including ruths family and also by those who held onto the more romantic murderedforthemap story blair writes that the national wire services picked up the story of ruths death and ran it for more than it was worth possibly seeing the mysterious story as a welcome reprieve from the bleak news that was otherwise typical of the great depression other deaths and disappearances since ruths death there have been several other allegedly mysterious deaths or encounters in the superstition mountains but its unclear how many of these can be regarded as reliably reported in the mid1940s the headless remains of prospector james a cravey were reportedly discovered in the superstition mountains hed allegedly disappeared after setting out to find the lost dutchmans mine in his 1945 book about the lost dutchmans mine barry storm claimed to have narrowly escaped from a mysterious sniper he dubbed mr x storm further speculated that adolph ruth might have been a victim of the same sniper on july 11 2010 curtis meriworth 67 ardean charles 62 and malcolm meeks 60 went missing in the superstition mountains looking for the mine one of the men became lost in the same area in 2009 and had to be rescued on july 19 the maricopa county sheriffs department called off the search for the lost men they presumably died in the summer heat state park in 1977 12 acres abutting the tonto national forest were set aside as

cave and valley this bedrock is limestone over many thousands of years the carbonic acid which causes this dissolution is formed as rain passes through the atmosphere picking up carbon dioxide when it reaches ground level the water may pick up more carbon dioxide from the soil to form a weak carbonic acid solution this acidic solution runs in any cracks or crevices in the rock as the water runs underground with a continuous supply of acidic water openings in the bedrock increase in size and an underground drainage system begins to develop this in turn allows more water to pass through the cycle accelerates the formation of karst this process creates unusual features both above and below the land surface sinkholes vertical shafts blue holes disappearing streams springs complex underground drainage systems and caves are formed by this geological process caves or caverns that are large enough for exploration are not a required characteristic of a karst area we begin with sources of water at lost river cave and valley it is estimated that around 25 of the worlds population gets its water from karst aquifers in the united states approximately 40 of the groundwater used for drinking comes from these karst aquifers a spring is any natural occurrence where the groundwater aquifer intersects the surface emergence of the groundwater at this point to the surface results in a surface stream sinking streams lose part or all of their flow to the groundwater system by disappearing underground there are three types of spring outlets first is a filtration or seepage spring the term seep refers to springs with small flow rates in which the source water has filtered into permeable earth the second is fracture springs which re discharged from faults or fissures in the earth in this case the springs follow a natural course of weaknesses in the bedrock the third type is tubular springs which come from waterdissolved underground channels or cave systems minerals from the underground rocks can become dissolved into the groundwater this may give the water flavor and even carbon dioxide bubbles depending on the nature of the rocks that it passes through this is why spring water is often bottled and sold as mineral water springs that contain large amounts of dissolved sodium salts like sodium carbonate are called soda springs as late as the 1990s the lost river cave was an ecological disaster the mindset of some locals that it was a holeto fill it up a concerned and dedicated crew hauled several tons of debris up and out of the valley due to the quick drainage of rainwater directly into sinkholes karst aquifers can be easily contaminated since karst formations have high permeability this results in fewer opportunities for contaminants to be filtered out of the groundwater this groundwater provides drinking water springs to feed our waterways and as a habitat for subterranean species the rivers and springs in such areas are easily contaminated residents must be vigilant and work together to protect the water entering the ground due to the sensitive ecosystem of the lost river cave the city of bowling green partnered with the lost river cave and valley to construct a wetlands treatment system to remove pollutants from the groundwater before it reaches lost river cave the wetland system will benefit the park and all of the surrounding area it will collect runoff water from the bordering 31 w hwy and nashville road and help to filter that water before it enters into the cave system please make a note of your answers to these two questions before proceding on to the next point of interest 1 what river makes its appearance at this spring 2 why would the river here be considered a sinking stream next procede to

triangular trade between bristol england charleston south carolina cuba and the bahamas a blue hole is an underwater cave or sinkhole they are also called karst windows blue holes in general are somewhat circular steepwalled depressions they are named for the blue hue of the water the blue holes appear blue from the sun reflecting off microscopic particles of limestone in the water there are four blue holes exposed at the lost river cave and valley blue holes provide watering spots for birds and mammals using the lost river valley as a nature sanctuary some fresh water fish have been introduced for over a century one of the blue holes at lost river cave and valley was thought to be bottomless it was later asserted that the hole has a depth of 437 feet leading to ripleys believe it or nots claim that lost river is the shortest and deepest river in the world modern technology deems it to be only 15 feet it seems the strong current pulled the measuring ropes down and under at the

visitors center you have permission to proceed unaccompanied the history and items of interest of the cave here at lost river cave is extremely varied interesting facts of the cave are as follows the lost river cave has one of the largest cave entrances east of the mississippi river the cave was first inhabited by american indians as 8000 years ago from the late 1700s to the early 1900s the caves entrance was the site of many waterpowered mills producing flours lumber brandy and carded wool during the civil war lost river cave and valley were occupied first by the confederate army in 1861 then in 1862 by the union army it was believed that jesse james and his gang stayed in the cave after their robbery of a bank in russellville in 1868 during the 1930s 40s and early 50s the cave was a popular night club it then went into disuse and was neglected in 1990 friends of the lost river worked to remove debris and clean up the cave and reopen it in 1999 the boat tours began at lost river cave the historic entrance into the lost river cave is one of 5 natural entrances the cave is approximately 7 miles long and is hydrogeologically connected to other caves in the system the cave passageways wind around underneath the city of bowling green resulting in creative engineering since the establishment of the city in the 1775 in the early years the uses of the cave were very primitive for example piping into the underlying passageways as septic tank dump stations now greater knowledge of the cave its ecosystem and its connection to surface waters has resulted in conservative developmental endeavors within the city protecting not only the structures above ground but also the pristine cave environment below logging requirements for this earthcache include all

deposits and the delicate soda straw formations friendly and knowledgeable interpreters guide you each step of the way the welllit easy walking tours can be enjoyed by individuals and groups of all ages the discovery on september 6 1883 fifteenyearold blanche hiestand a cook at marengo academy overheard some of the schoolboys making plans to explore a deep sinkhole located near the school blanche decided to beat them to it she excitedly ran home after work and recruited her elevenyearold brother orris they grabbed some candles and snuck out of the house blanche and orris quickly hiked up the hill past the cemetery by the church they found the sinkhole surrounded by a grove of trees and climbed to the bottom cool air steamed out of the small opening lighting their candles the pair peered inside ignoring the darkness and the mud blanche squeezed into the hole soon she called up to orris come on in together blanche and orris crawled down the steep slippery slope they found themselves in a large chamber that appeared to continue in several directions they heard water falling and saw formations in the distance though awed by the beauty of their discovery their flickering candles caused their courage to ebb the pair decided to turn back the slimy cold mud made climbing out much harder blanche and orris safely reached the top the late summer sun felt good on their skin as the two siblings now covered with mud headed home the original land owner was notified of the caves discovery a few days later and the cave was immediately opened to the public for tours geology of marengo cave marengo cave is classified as a karst cave the forming of karst caves is very complicated and it is still a topic of geological research but some basic aspects are very simple water containing carbon dioxide is able to dissolve limestone unlike with salt and gypsum water is not able to dissolve limestone without a little help and this helper is carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is a very common gas you know it from sparkling water softdrinks and beer they all contain it it makes them bubbling natural water also contains co2 but much much less as it is normally not bubbling just fill some water in a bottle and after some hours you will see small gas bubbles at the glass of the bottle carbon dioxide is in the the air about 003 percent of our atmosphere is this gas animals and humans breathe air consume the oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide many carbon dioxide is produced by biologic processes in the soil when the rain water falls it first absorbs some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but then oozing through the soil it absorbs much more biogene co2 in the water the co2 breaks up in two pieces thus producing a very weak acid when water gets in contact with limestone the acid solutes the limestone this happens on the rock surface just at the border between rock and soil but when the limestone which is originally water proof contains cracks produced by tectonic forces which is very common the water oozes into the rock and starts to widen the cracks and solute caves inside the layers with the small amount of co2 the amount of soluted limestone is very small and it takes several ten thousand years or more to form a cave the limestone in the spring water in karst areas is very common and well known to the people living in those areas if you heat this water the co2 escapes and the limestone gets solid again this process is similar to the forming of many speleothems in caves like drip stones formations marengo cave is truly blessed with a wide variety of speleothemscave mineral deposits these are commonly known as formations stalactites hang from the ceiling soda straws are baby stalactites stalagmites grow up from the floor flowstone deposits anywhere water flows draperies form along slanted ceilings helictites are strange unusual formations cave popcorn is knoblike in appearance rimstone dams form around pools of water cave life marengo cave maintains a constant year round temperature of 521 degrees because sunlight is nonexistent beyond the entrance area only a few nongreen plants can survive in the dark interior of the cave troglobites cave shrimp troglobites are animals that live their entire life in total darkness troglobites found in marengo cave include isopods millipedes springtails amphipods cave shrimp and blind crayfish in the lower stream level of the cave blind cave fish amblyopsis spelaea are found but not on the drier upper levels seen by visitors troglophiles troglophiles are animals that regularly live in dark zones of caves but can exist outside examples of troglophiles found in marengo cave are salamanders cave crickets spiders flies fungus gnats and cave beetles trogloxenes bats trogloxenes are animals that live in caves only occasionally or during certain times of the year marengo cave is the temporary home of bats cave rats and the white footed mouse all of which are trogloxenes fungi detritis organic debris such as animal manure leaves and dead plants enters the cave by water air currents or the bodies of animals detritis forms the bottom of the caves food chain and is broken down by fungi and used for their food to get credit for this ec post a photo of you in front of the natural cave entrance just like in the picture above or the dripstone trail entrance or better yet inside

find inside the cave this is a marengo cave approved earthcache site the information here has been reviewed and approved by the owner of marengo cave thanks to those who enjoy earthcaches and keeps cav scout placing them cav scout has earned gsas highest level why do i ask for a face in the picture of the earthcacher finding any of my earthcaches a face shot is the same as a signature in a log book many geocachers feel in order to get a find you must sign the log book period earthcaching is special and a human face is the same as a signature in a log book i do not accept hand shots pictures of a hand with gps because it does not show whos really visiting the ecs i set up for all to enjoy besides there is no log book for you to sign at a earthcache for anyone who doesnt want to post a picture of their face then log the find as a note or dont do it at all nobody is forcing anyone to come and visit any of my earthcaches i could argue that signing a log at a traditional cache is violating my personal rights because i have to sign a piece of paper maybe someone will forge my signature and steal my identity an argument that a photo violates a persons identity is foolish geocaching is a social activity eventually someone will meet you and know you are geocaching if you want to live a secretive life then geocaching is not the place to do so cache on do not log this ec unless you have answered the questions and have a picture ready to post logs with no photo of the actual cacher logging the find or failure to answer questions or negative comments will result in a log deletion without notice exceptions will be considered if you contact me first i realize sometimes we forget our cameras or the batteries die you must post a photo at the time of logging your find if your picture is not ready then wait until you have a photo sources of information for the earthcache quoted from the kentucky geological society i have used sources available to me by using google search to get information for this earth cache i am by no means a geologist i use books internet and ask questions about geology just like 999 percent of the geocachers who create these great earth

GC4D0QW,38.37562,-86.33965,Type.earthcache,how are caves formed most caves throughout the world are formed in sedimentary rocks sedimentary rocks are formed by accumulation of layer upon layer of sediments underwater marengo cave is formed in the st genevieve limestone which is made of compacted particles of mud sand gravel and bits of broken shells according to standard geological theory this limestone was formed around 325 million years ago when a shallow inland sea covered the southeastern part of what is now the united states later the land rose above sea level and the more impermeable sandstone and shales overlying the limestone were eroded exposing the limestone below marengo cave began to form as water sank into the first exposed limestone rock layers north of marengo as this water moved along the bedding planes of the limestone toward the water table the cave was formed by solution of the limestone surface geology and hydrology marengo cave was formed as blue river the master stream in the area and whiskey run creek slowly eroded downward water sinking into the ground in the flood creek valley about 15 miles north of marengo where the st genevieve limestone was first exposed at the surface flowed along the bedding planes of the limestone rock to emerge at the marengo cave spring on whiskey run creek at marengo the water sinks underground at the 645 foot elevation and flows generally downdip along the same rock strata where it reappears at the spring in the 580 foot elevation the water follows the dip in the bedding plane that slopes to the southwest at approximately 25 meet per mile this cave shows much evidence of various stages of solution backfilling and removal of cavern fill these changes were the result of flood creek storm waters which enter the cave system though numerous sinkholes in the valley leading to slush tube cave the water in slush tube cave has been dyetraced to connect to the lower level of marengo cave how old is the cave according to standard geological theory the st genevieve limestone in which marengo cave is developed was formed around 325 million years ago at that time a shallow inland sea covered what is now indiana geologists currently believe that the cave itself did not begin to form until the last million years when the impermeable cap rock overlying the limestone was eroded away that means the cave is probably less than a million years old the speleothems cave formations that are seen on cave tours have generally been formed since the water abandoned the upper level of the cave entirely while there is much we do not know most speleothems are probably from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of years old sinking stream all the water in flood creek enters the underground cave system through numerous deep sinkholes in the valley floor the cave serves as the drain of the area whiskey run creek whiskey run is one of the few surface tributaries of blue river which drains most of the southern indiana cave area except during periods of heavy rainfall most of this water in the creek is supplied by the marengo cave spring and water from the old town spring cave located about 1000 feet upstream from the marengo cave spring main passage dripstone trail this arched passage is an example of a phreatic passage initially formed at or just below the water table originally a tube the passage has been greatly enlarged by vadose above water table down cutting of a running underground stream the large canyon in the floor of the tube formed as the area water table dropped the orientation of the passage generally perpendicular to the drip is consistent with phreatic conditions present when the passage first started to form the passage is nearly half filled with sediments deposited by the former cave stream later ponded flood waters left fine silt and clay over the gravel stream bed lovers retreat lovers retreat is a good example of a keyhole passage the keyhole shape is formed when a canyon forms in the floor of an older tube stream action apparently the water table was dropping rapidly so the narrow canyon had little time in which to widen the passage stewart hall stewart hall is a large chamber formed by the collapse of the cave ceiling these slabs and blocks of fallen rock are called breakdown this collapse formed the largest room in marengo cave the room is approximately 350 feet wide and over 250 feet long the ceiling of the room is nearly 60 feet above the underground river which is slowly dissolving the pile of rock which has fallen from the ceiling numerous unique whitetipped stalagmites have formed on the breakdown in the room lower stream level this large stream passage is an example of a large canyon formed by a flowing underground stream this water flows above the water table generally down the dip in the rock strata following the same rock layer along the entire level of the main passage notice the flat ceiling formed by a bedding plane along which the cave started to dissolve wide canyons form when the water table is dropping slowly allowing solution at the same level over a long period of time this passage may be the largest cave passage ever found in an indiana cave washington avenue this passage is a classic tube formed along the bedding plane at or just below the water table in the saturated zone these phreatic passages are tubular in shape and generally wider than they are high tubular passages have very little slope and are formed by slow moving waters to log this earthcache send me the following answers 1

may 19 1928 the transformation of the gob pile from an eyesore to history brings the day closer to moving the mather mine memorial which was dedicated in may 2002 through the efforts of a volunteer committee headed by chick charlotte virgili the memorial is to be moved to the reclaimed site and a park or recreation fields established for the benefit of the community the monument is an eightfoot blackgranite marker on the lawn of mather christian church the dedication ceremoney brought out several hundred people many descendants of those killed in what is still known as one of the 10 worst mining disasters in us history the disaster had never been marked in any permanent way in mather but about a year ago orlando chick virgili and his wife charlotte decided that needed to change the entire ceremony was a solemn moving experience including the personal memories of the speakers the reading aloud of the names and a solitary voice singing nearer my god to thee but it was the eery moan of the mather collerieries whistle at exactly 407 pm sunday the day of the dedication service that silenced the crowd transporting them back in time to that tragic day united mine workers of america umwa president cecil roberts described what it must have been like in those first moments imagine youre a wife home washing clothes and tending the children and you know that whistle means another disaster he said imagine youre a child and you know theres a chance your father might not be coming home imagine the people running to the mine imagine the commotion in this community imagine the bodies in all nearly 100 women were widowed and 500 children were orphaned afterwards roberts said the wives had no husbands no home and no place to go some went to the company store and begged as

until he came to the 14 butt where between two trap doors in an air shaft which guaranteed him fresh air he sat down to rest could not get up i couldnt get up again after i sat down the rescued miner was quoted as saying i tried several times to rise and continue walking but each time my knees gave way then i decided to sit there and wait what was coming to me i had two long sleeps that i know of and each time i woke up i thought i was in another world fortunately i had plenty of water and dirty as it was it tasted excellent to me i kept my handkerchief soaked in the water and pressed to my face those who talked with krubik and there were only a few said it was impossible to continue a lengthy conversation for he became delirious under the slightest strain he was being cared for by several nurses and doctors at the mines emergency hospital tonight while state troopers guarded the door permitting only authorized persons to enter not enough for harm members of the mine rescue team which located krubik said tests of the air in the room where he was found showed signs of afterdamp but not sufficient to cause a mans collapse tests of the air were made with canary birds since the

GCZBFE,39.92768,-80.07685,Type.traditional,this cache is hidden near where mather mine was located the history of it is interesting papappycacher shared a bit as we looked for a place to hide the cache in 1928 this mine was the location of one of the worst disasters in mining history there was an explosion that killed approximately 195 miners different sources show different numbers and some people were never found there is a memorial to these miners in the yard of the mather christian church the link included is a link to a video done by waynesburg college students about the mine disaster the railroad trestle the cache is hidden near held the track the train used to take coal from the mine again it is not at all necessary to go on the trestle you can pretty much walk along a trail the entire way there is one dirt roadblock placed to prevent people from driving back and dumping garbage you need to walk around its right at the best place to park there is also a smaller pile closer to the cache site i think may have originally been placed to use as a jump for four wheelers you can easily walk to the site without danger of being run over by four wheelers the cache is a 50 cal ammo can with a logbook and assorted items that hopefully will appeal to a variety of family members ps would definitely recommend wearing boots or at least waterproof shoes

GC4M9N5,36.76247,-76.03742,Type.traditional,matildas bat cave is the second installment in a series of paddling caches we are placing to honor our beloved pet cockatiels matilda was the first baby bird to come from the union of our pair chloe and sydney one day in december of 1993 chloe started to act funny we were very worried about her and watching her carefully as she seemed to be having some difficulty moving around we were very surprised when she suddenly laid an egg since we had been convinced that sydney was a little too disorganized to mate successfully despite chloes temptress behavior we immediately set about learning all we could about baby cockatiels since our experience had been limited to caring for the two we had sydney had been handraised by a breeder and chloe was raised by her pet cockatiel parents her story can be found in the description of chloes perch gc4g08z but neither had come to live with us until they were ready to be on their own fortunately chloe and sydney seemed to know what to do so we gave them a nest box and settled in to wait sure enough about three weeks later matilda and kiwi arrived it was a joy to watch chloe and sydney care for their offspring like all firsttime grandparents we watched everything they did with concern they filled the babies up with so much food that they could not sit up it seemed they knew what they were doing however and the baby birds rapidly grew into their oversized crops at six weeks of age matilda had a tragic accident we did not think that her wings were developed enough to fly very successfully but she was startled by a noise and flew like a bullet straight into a plateglass window suffering some sort of cervical injury that left her paralyzed on the floor after we rushed her to the vet we were very worried that she was not going to make it dr hulls was great and gave her some injections to stimulate nerve growth after a few days in the hospital he told us that matilda might recover if we were willing to work with her we brought our baby home to find that chloe and sydney did not want anything to do with her cockatiels lead a difficult life in the wild and it seems that parents cut their losses when a baby bird is injured chickeybabe and i became surrogate parents hand feeding matilda with a syringe every few hours around the clock stretching and exercising her paralyzed right leg while she slowly grew and recovered after nursing her back to health we could not consider sending her away to a new home so she became a permanent member of our flock matilda made about a 90 recovery and was her moms favorite for the next 14 years as an adult she was a little clumsy but generally showed little residual effect from her injury due to all the handling as a baby she was the most lovable of our pets and enjoyed being cuddled in chickeybabes hands which we called her bat cave her health began declining in the spring of 2008 and she passed away in august we still think about her and miss her every day knowledgeable readers will note from the pictures that matilda was actually a male cockatiel but since we named our babies in the egg getting the gender wrong was always a possibility matildas bat cave is a microsized container hidden in a cavelike spot along a quiet tributary of west neck creek in periods of high water it should be reachable by an easy paddle from the doziers creek launch if the water is low a little more creativity may be required we hope that our geocaching friends enjoy the hunt congratulations to jtmlam59 and booshaka on their cooperative ftf

GC2EFHM,45.46915,-75.8056,Type.earthcache,please remain on the marked trails at all times and obey park regulations note the gatineau parkway is closed during winter months further details can be found on the ncc website today gatineau park is an important nature preserve measuring 36131 hectares but that wasnt always the case early settlers found the area attractive for fur trapping forestry and mining the region was explored drilled and exploited for the riches it contained and entrepreneurs made use of its forests water power and even its underground resources one of the remnants of this era can be found along the pink lake trail here you will find the pit from an old mica mine the word mica is thought to be derived from the latin word micare meaning to glitter in reference to the brilliant appearance of this mineral especially when in small scales it was one of the most interesting minerals we learned about in my junglehair geology classes mica is the glittery mineral you find in schist and the dark flecks you find in certain types of granite two main types of mica are muscovite and biotite muscovite is colourless but may be green or light yellow biotite is a dark colour the mica minerals are distinguished by their perfect basal cleavage which means that they are easily split into thin often transparent sheets it is very resistant to chemical and thermal attack because it has high electrical resistivity and dielectric strength muscovite sheet mica large flat sheets which can be cut or stamped into required shapes is used as an insulator in electrical and electronic equipment its many uses include lasers pyrometers radar systems missile systems and aerospace components the largest documented single crystal of mica phlogopite was found in lacey mine near kingston ontario it measured 10x43x43 m and weighed about 330 metric tons the mica mine at gatineau park in the 19th century mica was valuable for its use as a heatproof window material and later as an electrical insulator mica mined in the park was transported to hull where it was cut and processed twenty tons 18 metric tons of mica were removed from two pits over 30 feet 9 metres deep one crystal of mica was removed from this mine that reportedlyweighed more than 500 pounds about 227 kilograms today the most easily accessed mica mine in the area is the pink lake mica mine this mine was first prospected by the kent brothers of kingston in 1903 by 1904 the mine was producing mica which was being shipped along the rideau canal to kingston where it was cut and readied for market this mine consists mostly of surface cuts most of which were opened using steampowered machinery by 1905 by the mid1910s the mine had closed down only to be reopened by the pinks lake mining company at the end of 1945 this company even ran a tunnel from the edge of the lake to the earlier surface pits but this was the last gasp for the mine it was closed by 1946 and all the equipment was removed source

trailhead and parking coordinates are included in the additional waypoints please note dogs are not allowed on this trail to log a find for this earthcache you must send the answers to the following questions to us using the link in the profile 1 before the mica was shipped to kingston it was extracted and split into sheets how thick were these sheets you will find the answer on the information plaque next to the mine 2 what is the approximate surface area of the pit to measure this you can assume the pit opening is perfectly round use your gps to measure the diameter of the pit from one side to the other using the black fence posts as your startend position under no circumstances should you go beyond the fences that have been set up around the pit be sure to watch small children

une des reliques de ces jours passes peut etre trouve sur le sentier du lac pink vous trouverez ici le puit dune ancienne mine de mica le mot mica derive du latin micare qui signifie qui brille ceci en reference a laspect brillant du mineral en particulier en feuillettes ce mineral fascine junglehair le mica est le mineral brillant trouve dans les schistes et comme grains sombres dans certains granites il y a deux types de mica la muscovite et la biotite la muscovite est incolore mais peut etre parfois vert ou jaune pale la biotite est daspect sombre le mica est distingue par son clivage basal parfait ceci veut dire quil peut etre fragmente en mince lamelles souvent tranparentes ce materiau est tres resistant au effets chimique et thermique grace a sa forte resistence electrique le mica muscovite en feuilles larges feuilles coupees aux formes desirees et utilise comme isolant electrique pour composants electrique et electronique il possede plusieurs applications dans les lasers systeme de radar systeme de missile et dans laerospatial le plus grand cristal de mica documente a ete trouve dans la mine lacey proche de kingston en ontario il mesurait 10 x 43 x 43 metres et pesait environ 330 tonnes la mine de mica au parc de la gatineau au 19ieme siecle le mica etait utilise dans les vitres comme materiau resistant a la chaleur et ensuite comme isolant electrique le mica mine

GC1JPGQ,38.32167,-87.17667,Type.earthcache,welcome to the midwestern abandoned mine lands reclamation site the 270acre midwestern site sits just north of highway 64 about 4 miles east of the town of arthur pike county indiana within the larger 6000acre mill creek abandoned mine land area which has significant value as a wildlife habitat millions of years ago when the area that is now called southern indiana was located around the equator it was covered by a mixture of shallow inland seas and swampy areas the waters eventually receded as the continents shifted locations leading to the death of most of the tropical plants that existed in the area as these plants died they accumulated in layers forming a carbonrich material called peat over the next several thousand years subsequently heavy layers of sediment were deposited over the peat combining pressure and high temperatures to squeeze the water out of the peat and turn it into coal layers of peat formed seams of coal which were subsequently mined in strip mines such as those that existed on the land that is now the midwestern abandoned mine lands reclamation site unfortunately the stripmining process is not an environmentallyfriendly one four mining companies mined coal at this site from august 1977 to november 1990 all four companies as well as their bonding companies went bankrupt leaving the area in an unreclaimed state prior to reclamation site conditions included exposed coal refuse unreclaimed mine spoil exposed high walls old slurry ponds ponded acid water adjacent to high walls acid water seepage from old underground mines and acid drainage into midwestern creek a tributary of the patoka river here is what the site looked like prior to reclamation the indiana department of natural resources division of reclamation was able to obtain in excess of $4 million of reclamation funds from a variety of sources including abandoned mine lands funds and lost suretybond forfeiture funds to reclaim the area the goal of the midwestern reclamation project was to improve site safety and reduce environmentallydegrading conditions by backfillingremoving over 4400 linear feet of dangerous highwalls reducing the potential for acid mine drainage eliminating 30 million gallons of acid water in slurry ponds disposing of abandoned mine equipment and reducing erosion by regrading and revegetating over 250 acres of acidic spoils the most unique feature of the reclamation of the midwestern site was the use of coal combustion byproducts ccbs in indiana there had been little use of ccbs in the reclamation of active surface mines up to this point in time although such byproducts had not previously been utilized in the reclamation of abandoned mine land sites the division of reclamation was interested in assessing the suitability of these materials for use as alkaline cover and structural fill in aml settings because good borrow materials are often scarce in surfacemined areas and because mine spoil which is abundant often has undesirable physical and chemical properties the division of reclamation determined that the midwestern site was well situated to assess the use of ponded ash and fixated scrubber sludge fss which is a mixture of fly ash gypsiferous fluegas desulfurization sludge and agricultural limestone because fss has a very low saturated hydraulic conductivity it was proposed to use such material as a cap over the pyritic refuse to prevent percolation of infiltrated rain water into the refuse deposit the final reclamation design utilized fly ash and fss from the petersburg generating station of indianapolis power and light to backfill highwalls and to construct cover over exposed coal refuse reclamation began in october 1995 highwall lakes were drained and backfilled as were other lowlying areas by late 1996 all of the ash had been delivered to the site and emplaced a passive anoxic limestone drain pald was constructed to capture and treat flow from the spring that issues from the abandoned underground mines a network of riprap drainage channels was created to capture surface runoff and direct it into sediment ponds at the outlet from the site wetland cells were installed to passively treat a zone of seeps located in the southern part of the site by late september 1997 revegetation and regrading were finished and reclamation was complete here is what the area looks like today the results of a study of the site by the indiana geological survey showed that this reclamation approach has favorably altered both the hydrological and hydrochemical conditions on site in such a way that rain water has a shorter residence time and is less exposed to acidgenerating conditions water monitoring onsite at the sites

GC4RNP7,38.32333,-87.17167,Type.earthcache,welcome to the midwestern abandoned mine lands reclamation site the 270acre midwestern site sits just north of highway 64 about 4 miles east of the town of arthur pike county indiana within the larger 6000acre mill creek abandoned mine land area which has significant value as a wildlife habitat millions of years ago when the area that is now called southern indiana was located around the equator it was covered by a mixture of shallow inland seas and swampy areas the waters eventually receded as the continents shifted locations leading to the death of most of the tropical plants that existed in the area as these plants died they accumulated in layers forming a carbonrich material called peat over the next several thousand years subsequently heavy layers of sediment were deposited over the peat combining pressure and high temperatures to squeeze the water out of the peat and turn it into coal layers of peat formed seams of coal which were subsequently mined in strip mines such as those that existed on the land that is now the midwestern abandoned mine lands reclamation site unfortunately the stripmining process is not an environmentallyfriendly one four mining companies mined coal at this site from august 1977 to november 1990 all four companies as well as their bonding companies went bankrupt leaving the area in an unreclaimed state prior to reclamation site conditions included exposed coal refuse unreclaimed mine spoil exposed high walls old slurry ponds ponded acid water adjacent to high walls acid water seepage from old underground mines and acid drainage into midwestern creek a tributary of the patoka river here is what the site looked like prior to reclamation over $4 million of reclamation funds from a variety of sources including abandoned mine lands funds and lost suretybond forfeiture funds were used to reclaim the area the goal of the midwestern reclamation project was to improve site safety and reduce environmentallydegrading conditions by backfillingremoving over 4400 linear feet of dangerous highwalls reducing the potential for acid mine drainage eliminating 30 million gallons of acid water in slurry ponds disposing of abandoned mine equipment and reducing erosion by regrading and revegetating over 250 acres of acidic spoils the most unique feature of the reclamation of the midwestern site was the use of coal combustion byproducts ccbs in indiana there had been little use of ccbs in the reclamation of active surface mines up to this point in time although such byproducts had not previously been utilized in the reclamation of abandoned mine land sites use of these materials as alkaline cover and structural fill in aml settings was encouraed because good borrow materials are often scarce in surfacemined areas moreover mine spoil which is abundant often has undesirable physical and chemical properties the midwestern site was determined to be well situated to assess the use of ponded ash and fixated scrubber sludge fss which is a mixture of fly ash gypsiferous fluegas desulfurization sludge and agricultural limestone because fss has a very low saturated hydraulic conductivity it was proposed to use such material as a cap over the pyritic refuse to prevent percolation of infiltrated rain water into the refuse deposit the final reclamation design utilized fly ash and fss from the petersburg generating station of indianapolis power and light to backfill highwalls and to construct cover over exposed coal refuse reclamation began in october 1995 highwall lakes were drained and backfilled as were other lowlying areas by late 1996 all of the ash had been delivered to the site and emplaced a passive anoxic limestone drain pald was constructed to capture and treat flow from the spring that issues from the abandoned underground mines a network of riprap drainage channels was created to capture surface runoff and direct it into sediment ponds at the outlet from the site wetland cells were installed to passively treat a zone of seeps located in the southern part of the site by late september 1997 revegetation and regrading were finished and reclamation was complete here is what the area looks like today the results of a study of the site by the indiana geological survey showed that this reclamation approach has favorably altered both the hydrological and hydrochemical conditions on site in such a way that rain water has a shorter residence time and is less exposed to acidgenerating conditions water monitoring onsite at the sites

the niobec underground niobium mine is located twenty five kilometres northwest of ville de saguenay chicoutimi within the limits of the municipality of sainthonore quebec the niobec mine is readily accessible by existing paved roads and benefits from available water supply and hydroelectric generated power supply from the regional power grid the niobec mine is surrounded by a mixture of forest and farms geology mineralization geology the niobec deposit lies within the southern portion of the sainthonore carbonatite within the grenville structural province of the canadian shield stockwell 1964 dimroth et al 1981 subdivides the grenville province into three distinct lithostructural units a gneiss complex the anorthosite and charnockitemangerite batholiths and the calcalkaline intrusions the development of the early paleozoic stlawrence river rift system was associated with extensive alkaline igneous activity kumarapeli and saull 1966 including the emplacement of the sainthonore carbonatite 650 ma vallee and dubuc 1970 a carbonatite is an igneous rock comprising at least fifty percent carbonate minerals occurrences on a global scale are sparse and widely distributed dominant carbonate minerals in order of decreasing abundance include calcite dolomite ankerite and rarely siderite and magnesite the sthonore alkaline complex is almost completely covered by trenton limestone of palaeozoic age and is elliptical in plan view with a major axial length of approximately four kilometres it consists of a series of crescentic lenses of carbonatite with compositions becoming younger progressively inwards from calcitite through dolomitite to ferrocarbonatite rocks immediately surrounding the complex are composed of magnetite diorite as well as hypersthene syenite mineralization niobiumbearing minerals of bipyramidal form are disseminated throughout the carbonatite the economic mineralization is comprised of ferrian and sodic pyrochlore generally in association with geological units rich in magnetite biotite and apatite the niobiumbearing minerals dispersed in the rock are finegrained 02 to 08 mm in diameter and rarely visible to the naked eye such that diamond drilling is the only way to evaluate the economic content of mineralized zones mineralized envelopes vary between 45 and 180 meters in width northsouth direction while their length can reach almost 750 meters the zones have a known vertical extent of approximately 750 meters although they remain open at depth the deepest completed drill holes are mineralized at grades equivalent to those of current ore production dips are generally vertical or steeply dipping >70deg to the northwest or northeast average grades of the large mineralized envelopes are between 044 and 051 nb2o5 the majority of the mineral reserves and the measured and indicated resources are located in the four first mining blocks between 90 and 560 meters in depth the bulk of the mineral resources classified as inferred are exclusively found in mining blocks 4 5 and 6 between depths ranging from 560 to 730 meters mine operations are concentrated between depths of 100 to 440 meters currently operating simultaneously on three mining blocks niobium in its natural state what is niobium niobium nb is a soft rare transition metal used in the production of high grade steel it is an alloying agent which when added to another material creates a material with substantial benefits steel containing niobium has many attractive properties making it highly desirable for use in the automotive gas pipeline and construction industries steel made with niobium is stronger lighter in weight and corrosion resistan where is niobium found niobium is found primarily in brazil and canada which account for about 99 of total reported niobium production and in australia the united states geological survey estimates world reserves at 27 mm mt of contained niobium niobium occurs in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite which contain niobium and tantalum in varying proportions the mineral pyrochlore is mined primarily for its niobium content columbite is mined primarily for tantalum with niobium extracted as a biproduct roskill estimates that approximately 97 of niobium is found in the mineral pyrochlore to log this cache you need to answer four questions 1= what is the method of the mine in sthonore

GC4C50N,40.66585,-79.03242,Type.traditional,on august 26 1926 two violent gas and coal dust explosions rocked the subterranean caverns the clymer no 1 mine located at sample run one and a half miles southwest of clymer cherryhill township indiana county pennsylvania the first explosion occurred in the first north off the main tunnel blowing the large doors of the manway and airway located a mile and a half away into fragments later the mechanical recorder in the fan house was checked to determine the exact time of the blast precisely 1 pm five or six minutes later a second explosion ripped through the already devastated mine with the force of a hurricane this blast hurled itself against the darkness leveling the ventilation doors and tile stopping in its path flame and coal dust expelled by the immense pressure billowed out of the mine and blew like a geyser over a hundred feet into the air there were 57 men in the clymer no 1 mine at the time of the explosion fortyfour men ranging in age from 1752 were killed nine men who were working nearer the mine opening escaped without injury the remaining four men were saved by rescue workers the mine was working on slack time with only a small crew in the mine usually between 400 and 500 men were employed at the mine in the 65 years intervening between then and now the initial horror of the clymer no 1 mine explosion has diminished with the exception of the survivors and the families bereaved by the tragedy the disaster has been nearly forgotten until louis tate of clymer began to feel a growing concern for the fading memories that surrounded the events of those terrorfilled days that had already passed into history before he was born according to the first newspaper accounts of the disaster the mine opened by the clearfield bituminous coal company in 1905 was known to be gaseous for 21 years the miners who dug the coal in clymer no i labored from sunup to sundown surrounded by unseen dangers often they laughed and talked among themselves enjoying jokes and sharing food and as members of umwa local 1489 indulged in a little gobpile oration while they waited for mine cars expressing their concerns about wages and working conditions at the days end they wiped their sweatandcoal streaked foreheads shouldered their picks and shovels and trudged wearily back along the length of tracks and tunnels that separated them from the outside world but on the afternoon of august 26 1926 most of them never made it mrs mart whistle whose house was located near the main portal sounded the first alarm alerted by the thunderlike rumble she ran to the window seeing the smoke and fire pouring from the mouth of the mine she notified company officials throughout the remainder of the afternoon rescue teams from several area mines accompanied by father fs kondria of st anthonys roman catholic church cleared away the twisted mine track tons of fallen rock and shattered doors that blocked their path to the dead and dying miners several times lethal gases drove them back so that each shift could work a short time before returning to the surface for fresh air by 2 pm four men still living were brought out of the mine in coal cars given artificial respiration and transferred to the dixonville hospital one of these mike puro lived to tell the story his brother edward who lives in ohio writes my father john puro was killed in the mine explosion at sample run brother mike was with dad at the explosion mike is now 81 years old mike tried to drag my father out but my father said go ahead son leave me behind or well both die it was the toughest decision of his life but he left him behind or mike wouldnt be here if he made the other choice my mother was widowed with 13 children george wasnt even born yet myself i was only 13 months old it was a real struggle for my family we have never forgotten that day the daughter of another survivor irene reshonsky who lives in commodore pa also remembers the impact of those fateful hours a newspaper account that came out the next day she recalls mentioned that some foreigner whose name could not be ascertained emerged from the whistle manway and walked away unassisted from the scene miss reshonsky believes that the foreigner was her father andrew reshonsky he had only been in clymer about eight weeks when the explosion occurred she notes he came to america from hungary in 1898 settled first in new jersey and then became a miner working in windber coalport and macdonald for years he wouldnt talk about the explosion but in later life when people would question him about it hed say yes i was in that and he would tell how he went into the main heading and he heard the first explosion he ran into a manway and his buddy blazey bucca ran in after him they heard another explosion go off shortly after the first they stayed in the manway there was an awful lot of smoke and gas fumes too my dad had his dinner bucket with him and the bottom was filled with cold tea so he took off his kerchief and soaked it in the tea and covered his mouth with it blazey kept insisting he wanted to leave the manway he kept saying im going and finally he did but my dad said im staying here blazey dashed off into the thick of the smoke but he only made it a few feet when he began calling for help he collapsed and my dad went after him grabbed him by his feet and dragged him back into the shelter at the same time dad found another man wandering around in the smoke too by the time he and blazey got him to the manway the man had stopped breathing dad and blazey put their teasoaked kerchiefs over his mouth and he started breathing again then my dad decided the three of them had better try to get out of the mine so they began crawling on their hands and knee trying to stay low enough to escape the gas as they inched along my dad said they had to crawl over dead bodies he even said there were arms and legs in some places he remembered to the rest of his life that some of the men were still alive and they were screaming they kept crawling and finally they got out a mile and a half outside the men wanted them all to go to the dixonville hospital but my dad just kept going he said i have a big family and my wife is going to be worried you see he was worried about us miss reshonsky can still envision the exact moment when the agony of suspense was lifted i can just about see him coming down the road on the sample run hill when she heard the explosion my mother told the six of us kids not to go on to the road because of all the cars and ambulances flying up and down but she started running up the hill crying already dad was coming so they met and hugged each other and they came home three months later dad took us to commodore and we started over he worked as a miner until he was 73 years old unlike mike puro and andrew reshonsky 44 other miners did not live to describe their experiences that day by late that afternoon rows of whiteshrouded figures lay in an improvised morgue in a clearfield bituminous coal corporation machine shop most of the bodies were badly mutilated making identification difficult by nightfall however all were claimed by grieving relatives in some homes two or even three caskets came to rest on sawhorses and planks hastily set up in the front rooms of the sootstained houses of sample run on monday aug 31 1926 men who perished in indiana countys worst mine disaster were buried in three separate cemeteries on a bright hot summer morning long ago 44 men joined as brothers entered the sample run mine together in life they were separated by death on aug 25 1991 at 2 pm they will be united once again as their names cast in bronze are now affixed to a monument fittingly made of the rough gray rock found in the fields surrounding the town clymer louis tate and edward puro unveiled the simple marker placed on the lawn of the clymer borough building assembled with them that day will be relatives friends and all those who wish to take a moment from their busy lives to remember men who sacrificed their very existence working the coal mines feed a family they loved now they rest with their gods in the heavens above

fut le premier a identifier ce minerai comme de lamiante et a en reconnaitre la valeur commerciale peu apres monsieur w h jeffrey avanca les fonds necessaires pour debuter lexploitation dune mine sur

pression et la chaleur qui ont forme les montagnes ont change la composition originale des roches sous terre certains mineraux ont une origine exceptionnelle car ils ont ete formes au fond dun ocean disparu le mouvement des plaques tectoniques a arrache des lambeaux dun ocean disparu iapitus pour former des ophiolites cest dans ces ophiolites constitues de roches vertes que lon peut retrouver des veines de chrysotile lorsque les conditions geologiques originelles sont favorables le chrysotile est une fibre minerale naturelle blanche qui a ete formee profondement sous la terre due a une exposition a la chaleur et a des pressions tres intenses la roche mere qui se nomme la peridotite a ete modifiee par la chaleur et les eaux qui sinfiltraient petit a petit de la surface du sol les

region had seen a strange material which came in veins in rocks on a hill called webb s ledge in visits at his parents in 1881 a miner of the name of evan williams was the first to identify this ore as some asbestos and to admit the commercial value shortly afterwards mister wh jeffrey gives the necessary funds to start the working of a mine on this site at the beginning the mining development leant on primitive methods they blew up then of the excavated hole rather shallow the asbestos manually was picked up the first shoring used to take back up the ore was operated by a single horse of course the modern methods of production are much more sophisticated working stretches far under the surface of the earth underground galleries today in fews last years the mine jeffrey knew many owners she suffered some serious economic problems and the fall of worldwide request for the asbestos was caused by the perception of health hazards linked to this ore today the mine belongs in jm asbestos inc she occupies a diameter of more than two kilometres a 350metre depth and a total area of six km2 this mine is the largest roofless mine in the western world the ore the chrysotile has exceptional properties he resists heat fire wear and chemical substances it is a good thermal electrical and acoustical insulating material his silky fibres can be spun and weaved they can also be added to other substances as the cotton the resin the cement or the paper its unique characteristics were worth him the nickname of magical mineral he enters the composition of products as the chrysocement pipes flameproof clothes for the firemen and the balaclavas of the motorised pilots he also enters the composition of the bars of brakes and the asphalt geologyjeffrey mine is located in the heart of the ophiolite complex that crosses the eastern townships and the beauce a band of mafic and ultramafic rocks real flap of oceanic lithosphere which existed under the iapetus ocean there are about 550 million years ophiolites are generally trained marine sediments basalt cushioned intrusion of gabbro and diabase and other ultramafic rocks of the upper part of the earths mantle dykes or veins are formed in certain parts of the deposit it is in these veins that are the crystallization of exceptional grossular and vesuvianites several minerals were formed in the bowels of the earth there are millions of years as a result of geological events the pressure and heat which formed the mountains have changed the original composition of the rocks underground some minerals have a unique origin because they were formed at the bottom of an ocean disappeared the movement of tectonic plates tore flaps of an ocean disappeared iapitus to form ophiolites it is in these ophiolites consisting of green rocks can be found chrysotile veins when the original geological conditions are favorable chrysotile is a natural mineral fiber white was formed deep under the earth due to exposure to heat and pressure very intense the rock which is called peridotite was amended by heat and water that seeps slowly from the surface the waters have introduced transformed the serpentine rock mineral

grand marais at the eastern edge and munising at the west sleeping bear dunes the apostle islands and indiana dunes are the three other national lakeshores that were authorized in subsequent years permission for this earthcache was granted by the pictured rocks national lake shore park service because of earthcaches leave no trace principles and the fact there is no placement of any physical cache container having a cache container placed anywhere within any national park service boundaries is strictly prohibited munising falls mosquito beach grand sable dunes a perched dune miners castle miners falls and pictured rocks view are the other earthcaches currently available at this lakeshore i must stress that this earthcache is only accessible by a water craft via lake superior if you are not comfortable navigating the waters of lake superior do not attempt to do this cache lake superior can be dangerous at times for small water craft such as kayaks or canoes before attempting this earthcache use common sense and a few safety procedures such as telling someone where and what you will be doing and wearing a life jacket continually monitor the weather conditions as they may suddenly change and there are a limited number of take out points along the 12 miles of cliffs it is strongly suggested you research your trip choose a day when the winds are calm i put my kayak in the water at miners beach which was 013 miles from the posted coordinates during your visit to the pictured rocks national lakeshore you will have the opportunity to see three prominent natural features the grand sable dunes on the eastern end of the lakeshore miles of pristine sand beaches in the middle third and lakeshores name sake the multicolored sandstone cliffs on the western end geological history recorded in the sedimentary rocks and surficial deposits of pictured rocks national lakeshore is limited to two widely separated intervals of geologic time the late precambrian cambrian and early ordovician periods 500800 million years before present and the late quaternary period two million years before present to the present during the cambrian and early ordovician periods sediments were deposited in the shallow seas and nearshore deltas that covered what is now northern michigan these deposits became the sandstone units that are exposed within the lakeshore except for their exposure near lake superior these units are presently covered by a veneer of quaternary glacial drift bedrock is best observed in the western onethird of the lakeshore where cliffs rise up to 180 feet from lake superior these extend along the lake about 17 miles from munising to beaver basin for a short distance inland from the escarpment bedrock is occasionally exposed ice sheets of all four north american glacial stages advanced and retreated through the area during the pleistocene epoch a brief readvance of ice occurred 10000 years ago in northern upper michigan melting of glacial ice within the superior basin produced huge rivers that deposited millions of tons of pulverized rock rubble in various configurations to the south of the superior basin a sheet of outwash of varying thickness was deposited along the south edge of pictured rocks national lakeshore meltwater carved several channels into cambrian sandstone bedrock the best way to fully appreciate the pictured rocks is from the water the cliffs rise majestically from lake superior showing their brilliant colors as the sun shifts in the sky sandstone cliffs of ochre tan and brown sandwiched with layers of white green orange and black glisten against the cloudstreaked sky and clear waters of lake superior where the lake meets the cliffs many sea caves have been carved out by the lakes powerful pounding force the sea caves at the base of miners castle are the subject of this earthcache miners castle sea caves sea caves are formed by the power of the ocean or in some cases lakes attacking zones of weakness in coastal cliffs the weak zone is usually a fault or fractured zone formed during slippage another type of weak zone is formed where dissimilar types of rocks are interbedded and one is weaker than the other typically this is a dike or intrusive vein of more easily eroded rock found within a stronger host rock yet a third instance is in sedimentary rocks where a layer of softer rock is interbedded between harder layers the cave may begin as a very narrow crack into which waves can penetrate and exert tremendous force cracking the rock from within by both the weight of the water and by compression of air sand and rock carried by waves produce additional erosive power on the caves walls there are four logging requirements for the miners castle sea caves earthcache first post with your log your picture of you holding your gpsr with the miners castle sea caves behind you your picture should have the entire height of the cliff from the water to the top of miners castle optional second in your log state the air and water temperatures and the time of your visit when i visited the site on july 14 2009 the water temperature was 54deg fahrenheit and the air temperature was 41deg fahrenheit at 700 am go to the national buoy data centers buoy 45004 in lake superior compare your readings to the buoys reading on the day and approximate time of you visit atmp = air temp and wtmp = water temp click on the icon at the top of the column for a five day history email me the following information third estimate the height of the tallest sea cave at the base of miners castle email me your estimate fourth use your gpsr to determine lake superiors elevation at the posted coordinates as you are facing miners castle you can see the upper viewing platform at the top of the cliffs to the west its elevation is approximately 775 feet above sea level subtract the lakes level from 775 to determine how high the cliff rises from the water edited by the one and only

limestone pavements poljes and blind valleys mature karst landscapes where more bedrock has been removed than remains may result in karst towers or haystackeggbox landscapes beneath the surface complex underground drainage systems such as karst aquifers and extensive caves and cavern systems may form the formation and development of caves is known as speleogenesis this is where we derive the word spelunker for one who explores caves caves are formed by various geologic processes these may involve a combination of chemical processes erosion from water tectonic forces microorganisms pressure atmospheric influences and even diggingmost caves are formed in limestone by dissolution solutional caves are the most frequently occurring caves and such caves form in rock that is soluble such as limestone but can also form in other rocks including chalk dolomite marble salt and gypsum rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through beddingplanes faults joints etc over geological epochs cracks expand to become caves or cave systems the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with h2co3 carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes and underground drainage limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation these include flowstones stalactites stalagmites helictites soda straws and columns these secondary mineral deposits in caves are called speleothems the portions of a solutional cave that are below the water table or the local level of the groundwater will be flooded corrasional or erosional caves are those that form entirely by erosion by flowing streams carrying rocks and other sediments these can form in any type of rock including hard rocks such as granite generally there must be some zone of weakness to guide the water such as a fault or joint a subtype of the erosional cave is the wind or aeolian cave carved by windborne sediments note that many caves formed initially by solutional processes often undergo a subsequent phase of erosional or vadose enlargement where active streams or rivers pass through them morrell cave is located in sullivan county it has more than 37000 feet of mapped passages on two levels morrils cave is commonly called worleys cave locally and is known for its voluminous size with rooms more than 75 feet wide and 250 feet long with high ceilings that often exceeds 100 feet it is noted for its beautiful formations within its eight to ten miles of passages the lower level of the cave contains a perennial creek complete with various fishes white crayfish and salamanders an unearthed prehistoric stonewall some six feet high built of rocks of various sizes is evidence that the cave was likely inhabited by aboriginal people it is unknown when the first settler entered morrils cave although it has been written that settlers surely would have encountered the cave by the beginning of the 1800s nothing is known of the cave until it became the property of elias s worley locally the cavern is often still referred to as worleys cave a large amount of saltpeter was mined from the cave early in the civil war a mill was operated in the early 1900s where the stream exits at the lower entrance of the cave it was said that the streams volume was sufficient even in severest drought to turn the undershot wheel of a large millrdquo a local resident john morril led many explorations of the cavern near the turn of the century much confusion has arisen over the years about the proper spelling of the name it has been called morrell morrill morrils morrels mirrells worleys and even worlies cave the issue was resolved in 1980 by the us board on geographical names when it approved the name morrell cave the natural

to mine upper silurian rondout formation dolostones and fossiliferous limestones from the earth this rock unit is largely comprised of the shells of calcareous organisms that lived in a shallow warmwater ocean some 400 million years ago this rosendale bedrock came to be recognized as the highest quality natural cement in north america it was known as an hydraulic cement because it hardened well under water the cement industry was founded in 1819 in central new york but soon shifted to the rosendalekingston region in 1827 where it flourished for over 150 years during much of that time the region was known as the cement capitol of the world natural cement production peaked in 1899 with an estimated annual production of almost ten million barrels of cement records of the century house historical society document that the century cement plant in rosendale was the last cement works to manufacture natural cement in north america the rosendale region maintained its competitive edge because of its ready market transportation access via the delaware and hudson canal the rondout creek and the hudson river the natural cement was used in many wellknown landmarks including the us capitol building the brooklyn bridge the pedestal of the statue of liberty the washington monument and the delaware and hudson canal production of the natural cement required a laborintensive refining process involving firing in kilns cracking and grinding prior to packaging in cement powderfilled 300pound wooden barrels miners excavated two narrow 10 to 26 foot thick members of the rondout formation faithfully following them along complexly folded and faulted bedrock layers often deeply below the water table today we see the results of their efforts in mines that are nearly level at shallow and steep angles vertical and even stacked one on top of another as they removed the bedrock using sledgehammers star drills black powder and much later pneumatic drills they would essentially create large rooms for safety they left large pillars to support the overlying bedrock ceiling or adjacent wall rock thus these mines are referred to as roomandpillar mines the accompanying map depicts a local roomandpillar mine with its numerous support columnsonce groundwater was encountered pumps were run around the clock to allow mining to continue interestingly trained expert cave

of several copper prospects in the connecticut river valley copper was first discovered in the newgate area in 1705 several attempts were organized to exploit the deposit but none proved especially profitable the tunnels that were driven into the rock were used as a prison during the revolutionary war it was then that the name newgate was applied perhaps to remind british captives of the

newgate deposit is of the former type and is referred to as a stratabound deposit the sulfide minerals bornite cu5fes4 and chalcopyrite cufes2 partially replaced by chalcocite cu2s are the principal ore minerals an ore mineral is any mineral that contains a useable element in a chemical form that is easy to purify metalbearing sulfide minerals are easy to purify by smelting in an oxidizing environment the bornite and chalcopyrite are difficult to spot in the mine because of their scarcity they were most all removed by mining activities and the dim lighting they are both dark colored they were disseminated in grey sandstones at or about the stratigraphic level of the talcott basalt brightly colored malachite cu2co3oh2 and cuprite cu2o are more conspicuous but are clearly secondary after the primary ore minerals they are easily seen in the mine more than 200 million years ago during the mesozoic era sand and mud which later hardened to sandstone and shale were deposited by prehistoric streams that flowed across this area of connecticut when originally formed the layers of sand and mud were nearly horizontal significant tilting of the layers occurred several millions of years later today the mine floor and ceiling slope at about 20o following the strike and dip tilt of the ore layer mineralization of the sandstone occurred before the rock was buried deeply enough to compact it ironrich dolomite ankerite recognizable by its rusty weathering precipitated first from groundwater that percolated through the rock later copperbearing sulfurrich solutions of hot salinewater migrated through the sandstone and deposited the primary ore minerals bornite and chalcopyrite or chalcocite later still copper was leached from the ore and deposited as malachite and cuprite earthcache activity 1 the coordinates given at the beginning of this cache are for a location outside the walls of the prison that may be visited at any time of year it is next to a plaque

past manitook mountain to the hills west of the mesozoicaged hartford basin three lines of hills may be distinguished the low treecovered hills in the foreground are underlain by sedimentary rocks of the new haven arkose that are triassic in age the hills in the middle ground manitook mountain directly west and the barndoor hills to the southwest are the western traprock hills of the hartford basin they are part of the jurassic aged intrusive igneous rocks and are composed of diabase and basalt they were intruded at the beginning of the jurassic period as part of the igneous event that formed the lava flows of the talcott basalt the mineralizing fluids may have been in part heated by these intrusive rocks the hills in the distant background that form the skyline are underlain by paleozoic metamorphic rocks a fault is found at the base of those hills looking behind you toward the east one sees the imposing cliffs held up by the holyoke basalt a lava flow that is younger than both the talcott basalt and the grey mineralized sandstones at newgate it is more likely that the mineralizing fluids were heated in association with the holyoke igneous event when the park is open you may gain entrance for a modest admission fee that is used to maintain the park inside is a small museum and several buildings on the grounds you may see the remains of a smelting furnace earthcache activity 2 the mine entrance is located at n 41o5773 w 072o 4472 go into the mine on your left at the bottom of the stairway entrance is some of the ore the ore minerals are disseminated in a grey sandstone here there are two minerals that are easily seen ankerite cafemgmnco32 and malachite what color is the malachite hint information about recognizing the ironrich dolomite may be found in preceeding narrative malachite is the easiest ore mineral to spot in the mine that is because of its distinctive color and the fact that is usually found with fedolomite also easy to spot it may be found along the walls of the mine and further into the mine on the ceiling and in pillars of rock left to help support the ceiling obviously most of the richest concentrations of ore minerals were removed by the mining activity the concentration of the ore that was removed averaged 12 copper what was left behind contains between 25 and 10 copper in addition up to 10 ozton of silver was found copper averages less than 1 in most of the grey beds uranium minerals have also been identified in the mine much of the mine is flooded it was pumped several years ago revealing hundreds of feet of tunnel along which little or no mineralization was found that part of the mine workings has since reflooded and may be seen at deepest part of the accessible mine the water level in the mine is equal to the groundwater level in nearby water wells about half of the mine above the water table ie not flooded is not accessible because of safety concerns they are roped off and should not be entered the

GC1RXZ8,37.49775,-84.221,Type.earthcache,pig mans cave is actually a rock shelter and located in the john b stephenson memorial forest state nature preserve in rockcastle county near berea the earthcache is located high up on the ridge line and can been seen from the trail the area is full of oak trees wild flowers critters and big colorful millipedes many rock shelters to be found in the forest but this rock shelter is the largest shelter in the preserve this earthcache highlights one of the many geological features found in the anglin falls area the earthcache was developed under permission of berea college the reserve is open daylight hours only and the collection of specimens either biological cultural or mineral and defacement of geological features andor vegetation is strictly prohibited pig mans cave was formed by erosion over a period of many years at one point in time it was part of the adjacent ridge that ridge was highly fractured over time the moisture freezing and expanding caused the rock to crack along these fractures and fall away from the ridge into it current location then the differential weathering of the softer rock stratum in the middle section out paced weathering of the harder rock stratum the top pig mans cave rock shelter is formed on a rocky bluff in anglin falls rock shelters form because of the process of differential weathering on the rock stratum over time anglin falls creek slowly eroded the sandstone forming a cliff or bluff above the valley the upper sandstone stratum was more resistant than the lower stratum which lies just below thus the lower stratum more quickly eroded allowing the upper stratum to be undercut this undercut forms the rock shelter weathering will continually undercut the less resistant stratum while also eroding the other resistant strata eventually portions of the roof will begin to collapse and fall to litter the floor of the rock shelter the final phase or the death of a rock shelter will be when the roof has a total collapse and there is no longer an alcove present the rock shelter is composed of sandstone called the grundy formation its an soft sandstone because of this water is the main force that created this rock shelter the primary lithology for the gf is shale siltstone sandstone and coal shale and siltstone irregularly interbedded with sandstone and coal shale and siltstone 90 percent mostly lightbrownish to greenishgray commonly limonitestained sparse black flakes of carbonaceous material in part very fine sand and micaceous in part very carbonaceous mediumgray to black laminated poorly fissile sandstone brownish to yellowishgray and paleorange commonly limonitestained mostly fine grained in part silty and micaceous sparse to abundant flakes of black carbonaceous material sparse impressions of woody material mostly obscurely bedded locally crossbedded in lensing units a few feet to a few tens of feet thick only relatively thick ledgeforming units mapped separately ironrich siliceous and calcitic concretions a few inches in diameter occur sporadically in all lithologies pig mans cave was probably once inhabited by the adena indian culture years ago the adena culture refers to the prehistoric american indian peoples that lived in eastern kentucky and neighboring regions of west virginia ohio and indiana during the early woodland period they were the first people in this region to settle down in small villages cultivate crops use pottery vessels acquire exotic raw materials such as copper and marine shell to make ornaments and jewelry and bury their honored dead in conical burial mounds do not attempt to enter the rock shelter or dig in the shelter its against the law and dangerous to even attempt climbing up to the shelter rock climbing is prohibited in anglin falls pig mans cave is named after the mysterious pig man pig man was a cat thief who began stealing cats and hiding them in the cave in the 70s rumors at the time claimed that pig man at any given time could have up to 20 cats hidden in the cave with others in the nearby rock shelters pig mans methodofoperation was to herd the cats he had stolen and take them to auctions in northern kentucky after cashing in at the auctions pig man would steal cats in northern ky and herd to southern ky and sell them to the locals pig man eventually stopped steeling cats rumor has it that he was caught by a local resident and severely beaten with a broom it is said you can still hear the haunting meows of cats in the valley on moon lit nights finding anglin falls is a bit of an adventure the official directions from i75 are to take ky 21 east for approximately six miles to us 421 s take us 421 s for approximately 28 miles continue into rockcastle county for 02 miles and take a right on hammonds fork road follow hammonds fork road for approximately four miles and take a left on anglin falls road the road goes down a small hill it is paved to the bottom but is gravel after that follow anglin falls road for one mile then take a left on gravel road to the preserve there is a small white sign on a mailbox that says anglin falls in black typed letters marking the entrance to the preserve the name venable is on the mailbox just before the entrance to the preserve there is another road to the left marked with a hand painted sign that says anglin fall farms if you pull in there some dogs will come out to greet you but you will not find any falls there is plenty of parking and you will find a nearby trail head that goes to the anglin falls be

it down the pipe below that connected the two is still there thanks to harry dolphin for some information on the mia second tower just a few years ago a vandal tried to demolish the second tower his tool of choice was a front loader or some sort of heavy machinery why someone would want to do that is beyond me but the vandal was forced to pay the cost of actually removing the tower properly which ended up being somewhere in the ball park of $40000 so when you go searching for this cache please leave the machinery at home you can find just over the hill a pipe coming from the ground into an almost aqueduct type holding area concrete walls and everything it really is worth checking out and just a stones throw away is loads of old foundations from houses also worth the time checking them out on to the cache itself you can tell by the terrain rating that this is not going to be easy and thats it good luck one look at the site and you should know exactly where i stuck it this whole park has been checked out every square inch of it anything dangerous has been fenced off including mines you will find hiking in and out the cache container itself only has a logbook and two pencils in it at the time of placement i have found the quality of swag to be decreasing greatly so i didnt put anything else in it the container however is large enough for small travel bugs and coins have fun and be safe the area itself is perfectly safe so there is no need to feel an danger but if what you are doing doesnt feel safe just forget about it its only one smiley and please replace exactly as you found lets keep it fun for everybody skill knowledge strength did you know this cache is part of a series its called sks sks = skill knowledge strength i named it that because to find these caches you will need at least one of these traits some of the harder ones will require more than one some are hard some are easy the whole thing with sks is you just cant walk right up to the cache and sign the log click here to check out the homepage some people hate series like this but others love them i like them because it gives you something to strive for something to get excited about setting a goal to reach the hall of fame is a good example there is nothing better than completing something you have invested so much time and effort into woodlits warning when attempting any of my sks caches please keep safety in mind some of these caches may require you to put yourself in a position that can potentially be dangerous best case scenario you sign the log and add one more story to your geocaching arsenal worst case scenario something goes terribly wrong and you die sure nobody wants to think about that but there is always that chance most realistic in these caches would be death by falling or drowning there are lots of variables that have to be met for the worst but you never know with water it all depends on the depth whats lies on the bottom that you cant see force of current and temperature of the water with heights you have just how high you fall whats under you and the angle you fall at and land but why take your chances play it safe the first thing you should consider is bringing a friend i always question my sanity because i end up placing these by myself some even at night so bring your buddy and make sure the person not putting himself in danger is the one with the cell phone also make sure you choose your buddy wisely they should be somebody you trust with your life and if they are the type of person to laugh at you for wearing that bright orange safety vest then maybe you sure consider bringing a different friend and always leave yourself plenty of time some things take longer than planned and you dont want to have to finish whatever it is you are doing by flashlight another important note is your equipment if required if using equipment make sure you know how to use it properly consider even practicing with it before hand if you have never used it before also take the time to inspect your equipment before you trust it with your life sharp edges on equipment may cause cuts in ropes ropes can hold extreme weight but the second they become compromised they become unreliable and dangerous one thing i like to do is ask myself if this fails then what if you cant answer that question maybe you sure reconsider your plan off attack not having a plan b is simply stupid better safe than sorry now keep this in mind while hunting for my caches if you prepare for the worst the best usually happens so take your time and make sure you have fun if its no fun then what is the point remember its just one smilie thank you and be careful

riverbluff cave springfield greene county missouri riverbluff cave was discovered accidentally on september 11 2001 while the county was blasting for a new road on the outskirts of springfield greene county missouri in order to protect the pristine untouched condition of the cave the county covered the entrance and created an airtight locked door and passageway system to guard against intruders during the development phase of the 53acre riverbluff cave site it was decided that the site was to be used as an educational tool to provide k12 educators an opportunity in which to conduct group and individualized research no public tours of this research cave are available at this time the cave is approximately 2000 feet long from main entrance to back room the heavily decorated main room occupies the first 200 feet of this and runs underground towards the top of the hill the groundlevel surface above this room has over 20 burlington limestone rock formations of various sizes and includes cutters and pinnacles cave width varies and there are two side passages that poke out into the nether regions of the cave one which contains snake remains and one which is home to the largest congregation of peccary tracks in the world why is this cave so important well riverbluff is home to many firsts for the science community inside riverbluff cave is a plethora of findings which have been dated at approximately pleistocene in age the time period that spanned from 22 million to 10000 years ago items include snake skeletons fossilized turtle shells numerous small rodent tracks and skeletons peccary a type of ice age pig tracks and numerous shortfaced bear and large cat claw marks which show that this cave was used heavily for shelter before it closed so many years ago the shortfaced bear was the single most deadly predator of the ice age it was bigger than polar and grizzly bears twice their weight more carnivorous and at the top of the food chain it had a short sleek stealthy body with long powerful legs a short face and a broad powerful muzzle filled with large piercing canines and jagged molars that could tear through the toughest hides and crush the thickest bones including those of a mammoth or mastodon peccaries are members of the pigboar family peccaries can easily be distinguished by the fact that their tusks point downward in true pigs the tusks curve upward in addition peccaries have less complex cheek teeth reduced side toes and large dorsal musk glands both the flatheaded peccary and the longnosed peccary stood about 30 inches tall at the shoulder and probably weighed around 110 pounds much larger than the modern chacoan peccary it was previously believed that peccary were only dragged into caves as food however the massive amount of peccary tracks found in the west passageway of riverbluff cave shows that herds of these wild piglike creatures likely used the cave for shelter studying the size pattern and age of turtle shells researchers have discovered that these shells likely belong to a neverbeforefound species of turtle though at least one of the shells is believed to have been an ancient ancestor to the missouri box turtle a truly amazing find has been the animal dung found inside the cave preserved dung is extremely rare and by studying this fecal matter scientiests are able to discover what the diets of these animals were like in addition to animal findings riverbluff is peppered with speleothems stalactites stalagmites and columns which adorn the main room cave bacon draperies and flowstone decorate the walls and ceilings full of soda straws can be seen in many places throughout the cave the difference between this cave however and commercial caves is that everything in this cave has gone untouched for at least 55000 years an equally important component of the site is the surface geology the exposed surface above the cave has one of the finest exposures of fossiliferous mississippian limestone in the area and contains a diverse echinoderm fauna as in the case of the subterranean portion of the site the surface has tremendous potential of providing new insights ino the paleontology and stratigraphy of southwest missouri most mississippian strata are crystalline fossiliferous or micritic muddy limestones interbedded with thin shales the mississippian sea began clear warm and shallow with profuse carbonate reefs as time progressed the seas became muddier as a result of the acadian orogeny the mississippian sea may have covered much of the state but as usual the deposit thinned over the uplift areas and was subsequently removed the most typical mississippian strata is the burlington limestone this crystalline fossiliferous limestone covers most of missouri and is also found in iowa and arkansas these usually include layers of chert nodules and a sedimentary structure caused by pressure solution called stylolites which may also become filled with chert or quartz during the mississippian crinoids were abundant these echinoderms resemble plants complete with a calyx head and a holdfast resembling roots although they are actually animals the common name for crinoids is sealilies the most common mississippian fossils occur after death when the stem breaks apart into numerous fragments look for these in the rock formations above the cave entrance so as you can see riverbluff is extremely important but why are we able to find all these clues about our past because of the lack of two things within the cave air and people air dries out a cave and essentially kills it the passageway to riverbluff is completely airtight and there is no evidence that before the blasting crew opened it there was ever a human inside the cave humans are the number one contaminant inside a cave even the lint on your clothes can have a lasting effect on a cave source information for this earthcache provided primarily by the websites for riverbluff cave <url> and the missouri

GC1JNXB,38.37687,-83.12358,Type.earthcache,saltpeteran explosive situation carter caves state resort park is a prime example of how water can change an area from solid rock to a geologists playground carter county has over two hundred caves sinkholes and other formations many of which are within the boundaries of the park itself in the early times of our country eastern kentucky was essential for iron ore and iron production timber salt and saltpeter saltpeter is the primary ingredient about 75 used in manufacturing gunpowder black powder its chemical name and formula is potassium nitrate kno3 the cave at this location was a source for saltpeter to be mined for gun powder production for kentucky citizens fighting the british during the war of 1812 this somewhat forgotten war fought between 1812 and 1815 occurred mostly along the border with canada near the gulf of mexico and the chesapeake bay region since the americans had defeated the british during the revolutionary war a few years earlier hard feelings and pride had kept the british at or near these areas their refusal to leave the american territory along the great lakes and their support of the indians on the frontiers forced the united states to go to war again formation of the cave this region is rich with karst topography areas where ground water has dissolved and eroded the underground rock this provides for the formation of caves and sinkholes which are abundant in kentucky as surface water soaks into the soil it continues downward by gravity until it contacts the underlying rock strata small cracks in the layers of rock provide a means for the water to erode away or dissolve the rock limestone and its family including dolostone are susceptible to this chemical break down by water as the water continues to flow into the rock it widens and deepens the crevice which formed the cave seen here there are two areas in the state that are particularly well known for these features mammoth cave and carter caves both of these areas formed in the same way formation of salt peter this cave provided the much needed ingredient saltpeter for the kentucky militia who were vital for our countries defense the cave at these coordinates was not as we see it today but rather mostly filled with dirt and other sediments by digging out the cave and mixing the sediments with water the potassium nitrate could be removed from the solution some mining equipment and a few of the wooden sloughs used to allow water to carry the solution form one location to the other can still be seen in the cave itself the removal of the material has allowed the visitors to now walk instead of crawl through the cave carter caves is well known for the population of bats that inhabit the caves in the area these animals provided the necessary bacteria from there excrement called guano for the formation of the saltpeter as the groundwater dissolved the limestone the guano allowed for nitrification the conversion of nitrogen compounds into nitrates to occur this is the basic process for the formation of saltpeter today black powder is not used as much as it once was it can be used for basic fireworks and is important for civil war reenactors cannon firing etc one of the main problems with the black powder was its corrosiveness when fired barrels had to be thoroughly cleaned to maintain future accuracy and functioning modern firearms use smokeless powders and propellants which are noncorrosive for the most part modern factories today sometimes include potassium nitrate as a preservative in food preparation and it can be refined to make nitric acid which is used in the manufacture of the explosive tnt saltpeter cave is located just across the road from the visitors center in carter caves

GC1TEXN,36.66925,-83.45812,Type.earthcache,along the south face of cumberland mountain in virginia are 24 caves varying from 20 feet to over six miles in length these caves occur in the greenbrier limestone formation and sandstone some of the caves contain dome pits up to 125 feet deep as well as small tight crawlways large enough for a small person or child to enter one of the most spectacular rock shelters i have ever seen and one of the parks main attractions is sand cave sand cave covers 15 acres of sand much of it as fine and dry as moon dust before the park was created sand cave was accessible by road from the kentucky side legend has it that sand cave once contained sand in 21 different colors truth is that the sand was collected and poured into glass vials in separate layers of red pink and brown this was before 1959 before the cumberland gap national park was established but still a few of those vials are sold on flea markets today the amount of colors is said to be lower and the amount of sand too although sand cave is just a rock shelter there are various features of a true cave on hot summer days the inner parts stay cool the location has impressive accoustics voices echo off the sandstone walls i noticed this when i walked into the cave i had passed some hikers on the trail on my way to sand cave i went to the back wall of the cave and took some pictures out of nowhere i heard voices just behind me it was the hikers voices and they where in the lower part of the cave by the water fall nearly 200 feet away the voices sounded as if they where next to me pretty cool i thought and startling at the same time decades ago churches used to hold singings at the site this was in prepark days when sand cave was accessible by road from the kentucky side now its only accessable by trail sand cave is named after its content the floor of the cave is covered by a beautiful yellow and red sand this sand is the residual of the cave erosion and has formed in piles and dunes inside the huge cavern sand cave is a wind cave sand cave isnt an actual cave rather its an enormous rock shelter carved by the erosional forces of wind water and ice at the low end of the opening is a waterfall just before you get near sand cave you will drop into a green alcove where hemlocks and rhododendron grow along a crystal clear stream sandstone is a very common sedimentary rock and perhaps the best known sedimentary rock it is formed in many environments as the name implies sand cave is composed of sand the grains of sand is composed of individual crystals of various minerals such as quartz iron oxides manganese oxides and other impurities can cause bright and contrasting colors in sandstones these colors are what gives sandstone its unique character and ornamental desirability the colors range from bright whites reds yellows oranges and even purples and greens colored sandstone is usually intricately banded in multiple colors which enhance its aesthetic appeal the sandstone deposits of sand cave is a beautiful part of the natural environment in the cave did you know that sand cave sits on top of the greenbrier limestone formation the greenbrier limestone was deposited in a subsiding basin in southeastern west virginia and adjacent virginia and across a broad shallow shelf located to the north and northwest oolitic limestones are thick and extensive in southern west virginia but most thin and change in character to the north an area of uplift the west virginia dome was active along the zone of change in northcentral west virginia the dome was exposed during early greenbrier deposition and remained as a submarine high throughout deposition of these predominantly oolitic mississippianaged limestones be prepared to allow the better part of the day to make this hike to sand cave its a guaranteed 8 mile round trip i timed myself to the cave and made it in a time of 122 that was at a brisk pace and i only stopped for water i think about 3 miles of the hike was uphill now if you want to take the family a partner or friends be prepared for an 6 hour hike round trip bring food water phone and be sure to sign in on

southern appalachians up close when hiking to this ec the forests and streams of the mountain side provides habitat for numerous species of plants and animals waterfall photo courtesy of team ammosuperman with a fairly mild climate the cumberland gap sand cave area is a great place to visit any time of year summers can be hot and humid with temperatures commonly in the mid to upper 90s winters are generally mild with rain and some periods of snow january through march temperatures usually range in the 30s and 40s weather can sometimes be unpredictable especially at higher elevations so be prepared please remember with the higher elevation temperatures are five to ten degrees cooler local legend has it that a young indian warrior would meet the young daughter of enemy chief at the waterfall the two would secretly meet here on moonlit nights eventually the father of the young lady learned of her meeting the indian warrior one night before she was to slip away into darkness to meet her one love the chief stopped her and sent two of his best warriors instead to kill the young indian as the moon illumed the young warrior called out to his love he heard nothing and became worried upon closer inspection he was attacked by the two enemy warriors the next morning when the chief awoke he discovered the two warriors did not return wondering what happened to his warriors the chief assembled a war party and took his daughter with him what they found was a horrible mess the two warriors had been savagely beaten and killed there was no sign of the young indian he was never seen again the young lady died of a broken heart it is said you can hear a young woman crying on moonlite nights the location of the earthcache is to the left side of sand cave lots of history here years ago people would come up here with church groups to sing gospel songs children would run about playing in the streams and old folks would tell stories of ghosts daniel boone and native americans to those who would listen a very picturesque place for sure the geological formation of sand cave waterfall for many years a stream flows over a large step in the rocks which may have been formed by a fault line over a period of years the edges of this shelf will gradually broke away and the waterfall steadily retreated upstream creating a gorge of recession the rock stratum just below the more resistant shelf is of a softer type stone meaning undercutting due to splashback has occured here to form a shallow cavelike formation known as sand cave and the shallow plunge pool under and behind the waterfall eventually the outcropping more resistant cap rock will collapse under pressure to add blocks of rock to the base of the waterfall these blocks of rock will eventually be broken down into smaller boulders by attrition as they collide with each other and they also erode the base of the waterfall by abrasion creating a plunge pool why is the water fall here cumberland gap falls is best described as geological formation in a region characterized by sinkholes underground streams and caverns these underground conduits are typically formed by acidic rain water dissolving certain types of soluble bedrock over thousands to millions of years the ridgeline or the top of the cumberland gap mountains is typically devoid of surface water as all the water is diverted through underground channels becasue of this the water that does not go into one of the sinkhole will travel over a water fall and continue on down the mountain the main theme for sand cave falls is the surface water flowing into streams and being channeled down stream and creating the water fall before it goes into one of the underground channels sand cave waterfall is a seasonal waterfall whats does this mean the waterfall is only active when there has been a recent large amount of rainfall for it to be active depending on the time of year you visit you may see gushing water or only a trickle coming over the side but when it is flowing you can see a few types of waterfall formations listed below are the common types of waterfalls you can expect to see around this part of virginia block a waterfall in a block form occurs over a wide breadth of the stream the waterfall must be wider than it is tall a waterfall with this form does not have to be a solid sheet of water across its entire width cascade a waterfall of a cascade form descends over gradually sloping rocks a series of small steps in quick succession or a rugged sloping surface of some kind cascades can be both gradual and steep curtain curtain waterfalls occur along a wide breadth of stream where the falls must be taller than it is wide a waterfall of this form often becomes narrower in low discharge periods fan waterfalls of a fan form occur when the breadth of the water in the waterfall increases during its decent causing the base of the falls to appear much wider than the top of the falls horsetail horsetail waterfalls are characterized by the constant or semiconstant contact the water maintains with the bedrock as it falls horsetail waterfalls can be almost vertical as well as very gradual plunge the classic and overly cliched waterfall form where the water drops vertically losing most or all contact with the rock face this waterfall form has also been referred to as a cataract and a vertical form waterfall punchbowl punchbowl waterfalls coined from the famous punch bowl falls in oregon occur where the stream is constricted to a narrow breadth and is forcefully shot outward and downward into a large pool segmented segmented waterfalls occur where the stream is broken into two or more channels before descending over the cliff causing multiple falls to occur side by side slide similar to a cascade a slide type waterfall descends a smooth gradual bedrock surface slide waterfalls maintain constant contact with the bedrock and are often associated with the granitic family of bedrocks tiered tiered waterfalls are characterized by multiple distinct drops in relatively close succession to one another whether or not a waterfall with two visible drops counts as a tiered waterfall is up to the beholder i typically require tiers to be visible together and within a given distance of each other sand cave waterfall is located in the cumberland mountain ridge north

GC2TJVK,37.15417,-86.04735,Type.earthcache,sand cave is probably most famous as the place where veteran cave explorer floyd collins in 1925 was pinned by a rock and trapped in the cave eventually perishing despite a large and wellpublicized rescue operation this sad episode s credited with focusing a great deal of national attention to mammoth caves following is a short story of a tragic event that happened at sand cave along the entrance road to mammoth cave on friday january 30 1925 local cave owner and well known cave explorer floyd collins descended alone underground searching for a cave in a better location the collins familys cave crystal cave laid too far off the main route to attract many tourists crawling through a very tight squeeze on his way back to the surface collins kicked a rock loose behind him pinning his leg constrained by the tight passage floyd collins was trapped 60 feet below the surface after locating floyd the following morning friends and family made several unsuccessful attempts to free him over the next five days word of floyds plight spread fast and soon help was arriving from throughout the region drawn by newspaper accounts an estimated 10000 people gathered around sand cave on sunday february 8th the atmosphere was that of a carnival families picnicked children frolicked concession stands sold food and drink and prayer groups formedwhile moonshiners slipped in and out of the crowd before long the crowd dispersed leaving behind the rescuers working nonstop to sink a rescue shaft to get floyd out for days volunteer crews labored in 24 hour shifts under the lip of a rock ledge to sink a rescue shaft 60 feet to reach floyd collins no contact with floyd had been possible since a collapse on february 3rd the work slowed down due to the inability to use explosives or heavy machinery for fear of causing further collapse every inch of the shaft had to be shored up to protect those laboring with hand tools against stone on the morning of february 16th a 12 foot lateral tunnel broke through to floyd he was found dead floyd was eventually removed from the cave and sand cave soon fell silent again but the story of floyd collins continues to be told in song theater and film floyd collinss entrapment did much to publicize the cave region of kentucky and one year later in 1926 the southern appalachian commission would recommend that mammoth cave be added to the growing national park system now for the geology of sand cave sand cave is made up of sandstone and limestone the upper sandstone member is known as the big clifty sandstone thin sparse layers of limestone interspersed within the sandstones give rise to an epikarstic zone in which tiny conduits are dissolved by the natural acidity of groundwater the epikarstic zone concentrates local flows of runoff into highelevation springs which emerge at the edges of ridges the resurgent water from these springs typically flows briefly on the surface before sinking underground again at elevation of the contact between the sandstone caprock and the underlying massive limestones it is in these underlying massive limestone layers that the humanexplorable cavescaverns large enough for humans to move around in of the region have naturally developed the limestone layers of the stratigraphic column beneath the big clifty in increasing order of depth below the ridgetops are the girkin formation the st genevieve limestone and the st louis limestone the upper sandstone caprock is relatively hard for water to penetrate the exceptions are where vertical cracks occur this protective role means that many of the older upper passages of the cave system are very dry with no stalactitesformations that hang from the ceiling of caves stalagmitesformations that rise from the floor of caves or other formations which require flowing or dripping water to develop however the sandstone caprock layer has been dissolved and eroded at many locations within the park such as the frozen niagara room the contact between limestone and sandstone can be found by hiking from the valley bottoms to the ridgetops typically as one approaches the top of a ridge one sees the outcrops of exposed rock change in composition from limestone to sandstone at a welldefined elevation to get credit for this earth cache you must hike to the posted coordinates find the answers to

founder of shelby medical school in nashville dr john shelby once owned the land that is now shelby park around the turn of the 20th century a real estate company purchased the land which the company considered prime for residential development to create interest in that section it was decided to build an amusement park named for the early 19th century physician dr john shelby the park had a roller coaster offered band concerts dances and picnics boat rides balloon ascensions and horseback riding and there was a time when a free movie was shown on friday nights unfortunately the development firm went bankrupt in 1903 the nashville park commission took and immediate interest in the site shelby park opened as a public facility for citizens in 1912 within the park is a cave spring it is helpful to refer to the geologic time scale as we look at geologic history of this area of tennessee the geologic time scale was developed by scientists during the 18th century and provides a general outline for the organization of the earths geologic and biologic history the geologic time scale is divided into four eons each eon is then divided into eras with the exception of the precambrian eras reflect the occurrence of major changes in the history of the earth such as patterns of dominance and extinction of organisms each era is then subdivided into periods and then into epochs that represent smaller sections of time a majority of tennessees documented geologic history began during the paleozoic era some of the oldest surface rocks in tennessee can be dated to this era and are located in eastern tennessee the paleozoic era is further divided into the cambrian ordovician silurian devonian mississippian pennsylvanian and permian periods during the cambrian period tennessee was still covered by a shallow sea and a great amount of limy precipitate hardened to form layers of limestone and dolomite internal forces pushed the hardened layers up into two major domes known as the ozark and nashville domes that were connected by the pascola arch the nashville dome of middle tennessee is composed of sedimentary rock from the ordovician period limestone sandstone shale coal conglomerate and chert are the most common sedimentary rocks found in tennessee during this period tennessee was still a warm marine environment which allowed for continued deposition of large amounts of limestone and some dolostone which produced rock layers thousands of feet thick the formation of limestone versus dolostone during this time was determined by seawater composition and changes in the deposition environment many areas of rock contained up to 95 calcium carbonate as well as phosphates clay iron and silica towards the end of the ordovician period land emerged from the water as a result of the mountain building processes in eastern tennessee exposing the thick carbonate layers to a massive amount of erosion the marine invertebrates were responsible for the production of the thick limestone layers during this period at the end of the permian period after the allegheny orogeny the majority of tennessee was never again covered with water with the exception of the mississippi embayment in west tennessee the mesozoic era in tennessee was an extremely active time of erosion which extensively changed features of the landscape mountainbuilding processes from the allegheny orogeny caused land in east tennessee to continue to rise which pushed the seas westward and formed a coastal plain large drainage networks became established and aided in the erosional and deposition processes of the state during the triassic and the jurassic by the jurassic period erosion had affected the nashville dome and by the cretaceous period mississippian limestone was worn away creating a karst landscape the quaternary period is divided into the pleistocene and the holocene or recent epochs the pleistocene is often called the ice age due to as many as four major advancements of ice sheets that moved across north america during this time tennessee was never directly affected by the encroachment of the ice sheets however the alternating extreme periods of cold temperatures affected the climate landscapes and life in the state as the sea level changed with the advancement then retreat of glaciers patterns of erosion and deposition in rivers and streams also changed tennessees extensive cave system and karst landscape are products of the quaternary period with at least 2000 caves formed from the erosion and weathering of the carbonatebased limestone and dolostone many large caves have been developed for the tourist industry in areas of sullivan blount grainger hamilton and warren counties this location is an example of a karst spring emerging from the side of a hill exiting through a cave though only the entrace to this cave is big enough to explore the water you see flowing out of the right side comes from a welldeveloped karst conduit system much of the water a karst spring receives is drainage from all the sinkholes and sinking streams within its groundwater basin equivalent to a watershed on the surface once beneath the surface the groundwater is unevenly distributed through the karst bedrock there is plenty of soluble carbonate limestone bedrock and enough rain each year to allow for dissolution of the limestone rain as it falls reacts with carbondioxide to form some carbonic acid which acidifies the rainwater this rainwater filters through cracks and dissolves the limestoneas it passes carving conduits in the surrounding limestone these carrying water from each point where water sinks joining together underground to form successively larger passages with everincreasing flow which eventually discharges at a spring the amount of water that flows from springs depends on many factors including the size of the caverns within the rocks the size of the spring basin and the amount of rainfall human activities also can influence the volume of water that discharges from a spring its likely that the nearby parking lots and concrete have diverted much of the water that has been available to feed this spring in the past cave springs can be classified by how much water is being discharged if a spring flows only after a hard rain is called an ephemeral spring but if it flows yearround it is classified as a perennial spring this cave spring is an perennial spring the largest springs are called firstmagnitude defined as springs that discharge water at a rate of at

rock types and are caused by differing geological formations and processes caves can range in size from caves the size of small rooms like the one that you will be examining to the long formations that are miles upon miles long the scientific study of caves is called speleology caves have been dated to prehistoric times evidence of early human remains have been found in caves paintings called hieroglyphics have been found in caves and have been dated back hundreds of thousands of years early man of the cromagnon period constructed murals on the walls of caves that depicted everyday life caves are one of the earliest forms of shelter they were instrumental in the ice age for use of shelter types of caves a simple classification of caves includes four main types of caves solution caves are formed in carbonate and sulfate rocks such as limestone dolomite marble and gypsum the action of slow moving ground water dissolves the rock and forms tunnels passages and caverns this is the most common type of cave and some experts say its the easiest to identify lava caves are tunnels or tubes in lava formed when the outer surface of a lava flow cools and hardens while the molten lava within continues to flow and eventually drains out through the newly formed tube sea caves are formed by the constant action of waves which attacks the weaker portions of rocks lining the shores of oceans and large lakes such caves testify to the enormous pressures exerted by waves and to the corrosive power of wavecarried sand and gravel glacier caves are formed by melt water which excavates drainage tunnels through the ice of entirely different origin and not to be included in the category of glacier caves are socalled ice caves which usually are either solution caves or lava caves within which ice forms and persists through all or most of the year how caves form the meltwater streams draining out along the floor of a glacier cave or the surging pounding waves at the mouth of a sea cave offer immediate evidence of the origin of these caves solution caves however have always been a source of wonder to man how do these extensive complex and in some places beautifully decorated passageways develop solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water they can be thought of as part of a huge subterranean plumbing system after a rain water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock and percolates beneath the land surface eventually some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water the term water table refers to the upper surface of this saturated zone calcite calcium carbonate the main mineral of limestone is barely soluble in pure water rainwater however absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation the water combining chemically with the carbon dioxide forms a weak carbonic acid solution this acid slowly dissolves calcite forms solution cavities and excavates passageways the resulting calcium bicarbonate solution is carried off in the underground drainage system a second stage in cave development occurs after a lowering of the water table the water table normally sinks as the river valleys deepen during this stage the solution cavities are stranded in the unsaturated zone where air can enter this leads to the deposition of calcite which forms a wide variety of dripstone features the chemical process causing deposition of calcite is the reverse of the process of solution water in the unsaturated zone which dissolved some calcite as it trickled down through the limestone above the cave is still enriched with carbon dioxide when it reaches the ventilated cave the carbon dioxide gas escapes from the water just as it escapes from an opened bottle of soda pop the acidity of the water is thereby reduced the calcium bicarbonate cannot remain in solution and calcite is deposited as dripstone cave features the most familiar types of features are stalactites and stalagmites stalactites hang downward from the ceiling and are formed as drop after drop of water slowly trickles through cracks in the cave roof as each drop of water hangs from the ceiling it loses carbon dioxide and deposits a film of calcite successive drops add ring below ring the water dripping through the hollow center of the rings until a pendant cylinder forms tubular or soda straw stalactites grow in this way most are fragile and have the diameter of a drop of water but some reach a length of perhaps a yard or more the large coneshaped stalactites begin as these fragile tubes and then enlarge to cones when enough water accumulates to flow along the outside of the soda straws deposition of calcite on the outside of the tubes most of which are near the ceiling and taper downward results in the familiar cone shapes stalagmites grow upward from the floor of the cave generally as a result of water dripping from overhanging stalactites a column forms when a stalactite and a stalagmite grow until they join a curtain or drapery begins to form on an inclined ceiling when the drops of water trickle along a slope gradually a thin sheet of calcite grows downward from the ceiling and hangs in decorative folds like a drape sheets of calcite that are deposited on the walls or floor by flowing water are called flowstone rimstone dams are raised fencelike deposits of calcite on the cave floor that form around pools of water rock material produced by the collapse of the ceiling or walls of a cave is called breakdown and may range in size from plates and chips to massive blocks most breakdown present in caves today appears to have occurred thousands of years ago it is generally associated

settlers arrived expecting ground that would be excellent to farm and discovered instead bedrock just below the surface of topsoil making this land difficult to plant crops and establish a farming community other sources of income were needed so mining operations in addition to the logging in the area became profitable for a period of time silver queen mine is one of several mines in the area that produced mainly mica as well as apatite which is also known as phosphate and is often found alongside mica and feldspar this vast region of ancient rock known as the canadian shield was once part of the tallest mountain range in the earths history and over time was eroded down exposing the metamorphic rock which was formed in the earths crust by tremendous heat and pressure murphys point lies on the frontenac axis a narrow extension of the canadian shield that links to the adirondack mountain range thanks to several periods of erosion and glaciation these mountains were stripped of the overlaying rock and have exposed the billion year old mountain core bedrock that make up the frontenac axis mica mica is the mineral name given to a group of silicate minerals known as sheet silicate because they form in distinct layers micas are light and relatively soft and the sheets and flakes of mice are flexible mica is often used in electronics as it is heat resistant and does not conduct electricity apatite apatite is the name of a group of phosphate minerals with similar chemical compositions and physical properties they are an important constituent of phosphorite a rock mined for its phosphorus content and used to make fertilizers acids and chemicals a particular type of feldspar called perthite was used in the making of porcelain and earthenware feldspar feldspars are a group of rockforming tectosilicate minerals that make up about 41 of the earths continental crust by weight feldspars crystallize from magma as veins in both intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock mining operations sheet mica sheet mica is mined by either sinking a shaft along the strike and dip of a pegmatite or by open pit surface mining of semi hard pegmatite ore once a mineral deposit was found the work of prying the crystals away from surrounding rock would begin often explosives would be used to break up large sections of rock into smaller chunks that were more manageable but first bore holes would need to be drilled to set up the blasts in the early days this was done by hand with hammers and brute strength a team of 3 men would work together and could average 12 feet per hour much later when steampowered drills were in use care had to be taken and often deposits of good quality crystals were still drilled by hand and only lightly loaded with explosives open quarry mining located at stop 11 on the silver queen mine trail you will find a small open pit quarry that looked for feldspar a cloudy white mineral this mineral crystallized out of the same molten rock intrusions that formed the veins of apatite and mica and was the third mineral to be mined at the silver queen mine facts about the silver queen mine the silver queen mine was at its operational peak during the early 1900s and employed less than 30 men the mine mainly produced small sheets of mica which was used in the electrical industry as an insulator in items such as toasters and as windows in items such as lanterns the mined products would be packed in barrels and sent via the rideau canal to factories in eastern ontario and western quebec each year the mine is flooded from accumulating water and snow melt but is drained during the summer months when conducted tours allow visitors to explore the mine with a guide the outside of

GC15CQ3,45.85752,-84.61878,Type.earthcache,the primary process involved is erosion sea caves are found throughout the world actively forming along present coastlines and as relict sea caves on former coastlines in places like thailands phang nga bay solutional caves have been flooded by the rising sea and are now subject to littoral erosion littoral caves may be found in a wide variety of host rocks ranging from sedimentary to metamorphic to igneous but caves in the latter tend to be larger due to the greater strength of the host rock in order to form a sea cave the host rock must first contain a zone of relative weakness in metamorphic or igneous rock this is typically either a fault as in the caves of the channel islands of california or a dyke as in the large sea caves of kauai hawaiis na pali coast in sedimentary rocks this may be a beddingplane parting or a contact between layers of different hardness the latter may also occur in igneous rocks such as in the caves on santa cruz island california where waves have attacked the contact between the andesitic basalt and the agglomerate the driving force in littoral cave development is wave action erosion is ongoing anywhere that waves batter rocky coasts but where sea cliffs contain zones of weakness rock is removed at a greater rate along these zones as the sea reaches into the fissures thus formed they begin to widen and deepen due to the tremendous force exerted within a confined space not only by direct action of the surf and any rock particles that it bears but also by compression of air within blowholes partially submerged caves that eject large sprays of sea water as waves retreat and allow rapid reexpansion of air compressed within attest to this process adding to the hydraulic power of the waves is the abrasive force of suspended sand and rock most seacave walls are irregular and chunky reflecting an erosional process where the rock is fractured piece by piece however some caves have portions where the walls are rounded and smoothed typically floored with cobbles and result from the swirling motion of these cobbles in the surf zone to log this earth cache you must do these 3 things 1 estimate how high the entire limestone stack is 2 estimate how wide the entrance of the cave is 3 take a picture of yourself and your gps in front of the cave

GC1WYJQ,36.61582,-83.64373,Type.earthcache,along the south face of cumberland mountain in virginia are 24 caves varying from 20 feet to over six miles in length these caves occur in the greenbrier limestone formation some of the caves contain dome pits up to 125 feet deep as well as small tight crawlways large enough for a small person or child to enter indiana bat endangered other bats rats beetles and several invertebrates have been found in many of the parks caves one of these caves is the very popular skylight cave skylight cave is an often visited and beautiful cave its well worth the hike to see the cave is called skylight for a reason on the upper portion of the cave is a smaller opening that allows light inside the cave when you walk into the cave you will see what i am talking about on a good sunny day when the sun sets to the west there will be a beam of light that comes into the upper cave opening which provides some good photo opportunities the geology of skylight cave skylight cave is formed in the greenbrier limestone formation the greenbrier limestone was deposited in a subsiding basin in southeastern west virginia and adjacent virginia and across a broad shallow shelf located to the north and northwest oolitic limestones are thick and extensive in southern west virginia but most thin and change in character to the north an area of uplift the west virginia dome was active along the zone of change in northcentral west virginia the dome was exposed during early greenbrier deposition and remained as a submarine high throughout deposition of these predominantly oolitic mississippianaged limestones the transition from oolitic grainstones that contain welldeveloped ooids through grainstones that comprise less welldeveloped ooids mixed with detrital quartz sand to poorly washed quartzsandy oolitic packstones is interpreted to indicate flooding of the shoals around the west virginia dome cave geology skylight cave is formed in a rock that is highly soluble in water which is enriched with carbonic acid the water comes from rainfall and when it enters the soil it mixes with plant material where it picks up carbon dioxide the mixture of carbon dioxide and water forms a carbonic acid the carbonic acid enriched water finds its way into the water table this can be referred to as ground water the ground water finds its way into tiny pores and cracks in the limestone layer and slowly begins to dissolve the greenbrier limestone as time goes on the pockets and cracks enlarge to form small chambers in the rock there are occasions that the water table can create a hydrostatic pressure which will erode the limestone rock away quicker as time goes on the erosion process creates larger crevices and passages for the water to flow in more ground water is able to enter the passages and erode away the limestone even more quickly the passage grows in size with each rainfall but this is a slow process no one is able to predict how long it takes a cave to form some caves are formed faster than others and this all depends on the geological layout of the area eventually in geologic time passages are formed which are large enough to walk in hey cav what are all those cool rock formations in the cave formations in skylight cave come in all different shapes sizes and colors generally speaking the formations seen in skylight cave are made out of calcite which is a precipitate of calcium carbonate the added colors are due to mineral impurities mixed in with the calcite calcium carbonate is highly soluble in the carbonic acid found in ground water the ground water becomes saturated with calcium carbonate on its journey through the limestone the air in a cave is chemically the same as air outside the cave with the exception that it is very low in carbon dioxide the ground water entering the cave is very high in carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate therefore the ground water entering the cave is out of equilibrium with the cave environment and there is a transfer of carbon dioxide to the cave atmosphere causing calcite to precipitate out this is how formations are formed a water droplet that hangs from the ceiling of the cave will leave a small deposit of calcite before it is forced to fall to the floor of the cave the repetition of this act forms what is called a stalactite on the ceiling of the cave and a stalagmite on the floor of the cave if the process is allowed to continue long enough the two will join to form a column the names of the cave formations there are numerous names for different types of formations such as draperies curtains bacon soda straws shields and rimstone just to name a few needless to say the process is the same whether it is accomplished from a drip from the ceiling or water running down the wall of a passage formations are delicate works of nature which can take thousands of years to form there are other minerals and formations seen in caves such as fluorite dogtooth spar helectites aragonite and gypsum but these types of formations are much rarer and even more delicate there is also life or fauna found skylight cave these come in all shapes and sizes from a microscopic organism to larger species like bats and salamanders crayfish can be found living in the streams of caves as well as different species of fish generally most species that inhabit a cave have pigment and eyes but there are some species that have no eyes or color due to a long genetic evolution these are the exception rather than the rule crickets and small beetles also inhabit cave environments the list of fauna is too large to describe them all but i have given you a few examples of what to expect the upper entrance skylight cave is protected remember skylight cave is protected by law while you are allowed to walk into the cave dont forget it is also protected by law whether its state or federal and there are fines imposed on those who would destroy any part of the cave environment the motto of a good caver is to take only pictures leave only footprints and as few of those as possible and kill nothing but time this is where the fun starts the beginning of the trail to skylight cave alert a disorder known as whitenose syndrome has been found in caves in the eastern united states and is killing hundreds of thousands of bats evidence suggests that the fungus that causes the disorder may possibly be spread by humans who venture into different caves please wear appropriate footwear and clothing that has not been in other caves or footwear and clothing that has been properly decontaminated permission for this earthcache is allowed by the cumberland gap national historic park always ask for permission before placing an earthcache in the park to get credit

information here has been reviewed and approved by the cumberland gap national historic park thanks to the staff for their assistance why do i ask for a face in the picture of the earthcacher finding any of my earthcaches a face shot is the same as a signature in a log book many geocachers feel in order to get a find you must sign the log book period earthcaching is special and a human face is the same as a signature in a log book i do not accept hand shots pictures of a hand with gps because it does not show whos really visiting the ecs i set up for all to enjoy besides there is no log book for you to sign at a earthcache for anyone who doesnt want to post a picture of their face then log the find as a note or dont do it at all nobody is forcing anyone to come and visit any of my earthcaches i could argue that signing a log at a traditional cache is violating my personal rights because i have to sign a piece of paper maybe someone will forge my signature and steal my identity an argument that a photo violates a persons identity is foolish geocaching is a social activity eventually someone will meet you and know you are geocaching if you want to live a secretive life then geocaching is not the place to do so cache on do not log this ec unless you have answered the questions and have a picture ready to post logs with no photo of the actual cacher logging the find or failure to answer questions or negative comments will result in a log deletion without notice exceptions will be considered if you contact me first i realize sometimes we forget our cameras or the batteries die you must post a photo at the time of logging your find if your picture is not ready then wait until you have a photo sources of information for the earthcache quoted from the cumberland national historic park i have used sources available to me by using google search to get information for this earth cache i am by no means a geologist i use books internet and ask questions about geology just like 999 percent of the geocachers who create these great earth caches i enjoy earth caches and want people to get out and see what i see every time i go and explore this great place we live in

lightly raining and felt like i was passing through a magical otherworldly rainforest awesome 2 our veteran tour guide asked the group if they would like an added adventure not part of the tour yikes that was as close to spelunking minus the crawling that this terrainchallenged senior ever wants to experience again first had to get down the cliff to the rocks below ok it was only a few feet but seemed like a cliff then there were all the challenges to negotiate others were oohing while i was watching my step finally we walked millimeters next to a pool of water over sandy substrate one slip and into the water i would go depth unknown and i dont swim yep that was my first and hopefully last experience with venturing off the beaten path thank you chris perry park manager and robert myers state park naturalist for permission to share this learning adventure your permit for the earthcache cascade cave is 19103ccsrp cave this is the most popular cave but also the most challenging in terms of length and terrain lots of stairs however it is also the cave with the greatest variety of speleothems it is cut from the warix run member of the slade formation the cavern itself is made up of a series of parallel passages that are filled with dripstone formations of different types the large size of the passages suggests that they formed along a series of bedding planes and vertical joints the entrance to cascade cave is located along one of the many sinkholes in the area just north and west of box canyon wet cave vs dry cave speleothems are receiving water and so are still

this room formed beneath several sinkholes which conduct surface water into cracks the water seeping into cracks leading to the cathedral room has resulted in the formation of a variety of dripstone formations over the years it is reached by taking a short path to the base of a large limestone cliff frozen cascades room the speleothems here are a series of small travertine waterfalls giving this room its name it occurs along a narrow passage that is aligned along a joint fracture travertine rock is a type of limestone commonly deposited by mineral springs through a process of rapid precipitation of carbonate minerals lake room this room is named for a large reflecting pool of water the room is located at the intersection of two joints which act as a conduit for groundwater as active groundwater ran down these joints they were enlarged water from james branch enters the lake along a lowerlevel passage and exits the cave system through a small opening along the base of the

saltpeter cave is 19102ccsrp thank you paul tierney park naturalist for verifying accuracy of information and answering my questions cave this is a cave which contains just under 2 miles of passage way historically it served as a source of saltpeter which is used to make gunpowder currently it is a hibernaculum for the endangered indiana bat as you journey through this cave you will be walking on a dried stream bed containing bat guano deposited from hundreds of thousands of bats over time speleothems speleothems are predominantly limestone formations found in caves they take various forms depending on whether the water drips seeps condenses flows or ponds scallops are an excellent indicator of water flow flow direction is indicated by where the scallop points the steep side is downstream imagine that the flowing water erodes the side that it hits and flattens it the most making the scallop point downstream scallop size is inverselyproportional to flow velocity small scallops indicate fastmoving water large scallops indicate slow moving water scallops can be several feet in length or millimeters in length geology the major geological feature you will encounter is the array of kettles carved in the ceiling kettles are holes in the substrate caused by the action of water either solid ice or liquid water swirling water once inundated this cave when it was a subterranean stream the ceiling is made of bedrock the following questions were answered by paul tierney park naturalist what caused the formation of the kettles since all of our caves begin to form below the water table there is pressure almost like the plumbing in your home when that water hits something in the rock harder or at least a different density than the limestone it creates a whirlpool because of the pressure the whirlpool travels up instead of down why are they located in the bedrock ceiling this is for the same reason as the above answer there can be similar formations sometimes in the floor of caves that we call pits but since gravity is always pulling water down erosion continues to erode the bottom creating on open bottom in many cases instead of like kettles on the ceiling which most times stop forming once the water table drops for this area the limestone is the bedrock it is nearly all sedimentary rock there is no volcanicigneous and for this area there is also no uplifting or folding everything here at the park has formed through the solutionserosion of the existing sedimentary rock layers including the kettle bottoms when forming below the water table why is the smallest diameter at the end of the kettle within the bedrock because of the nature of a whirlpool what direction did the water flow scallops and erosion formations can give indications on which direction the water was traveling when the cave was first forming as a general rule the shallower side of the a scallop points in the direction of water flow is there a creek above there is no creek currently above saltpetre cave the cave was most likely formed by cave branch creek which is now below the current elevation of the cave saltpeter dried bat guano poop aka saltpeter consists of nitrogen phosphate and potassium potassium nitrate is valuable as fertilizer and manufacture of gunpowder history saltpeter cave is considered by many historians to be the site of the earliest industry in the area the cave was used during the war of 1812 as a source of the major ingredient in making gunpowder saltpetre it was listed on the national register of historic places in 2001 the tour will show you the implements used in mining of saltpeter and manufacture of gunpowder you will also see names carved on the walls of the cave rockwater relationship water is necessary for

GC15Q4B,39.705,-84.19333,Type.multicache,ive heard and remember reading local stories of a mad man that lurks in some sort of tunnel or cave somewhere around kettering the kids that grow up in this area seem familiar with the stories but they are just stories no one would last years while going around taking any opportunity to poke and stab and repeatedly jab an ice pick into his unfortunate preys eyes and brains this could just never happen this could not be true in a place like kettering ohio no one lurks in those dark places just waiting his chance to add yet another notch to the handle of his ice pick what a bunch of dodo no one can take this seriously no one could ever think such rumors and stories could possibly be true it just cant happen right i suggest that when doing this cache that you make sure to take a partner of course not because i think that any story of a killer ice pick man could be true you should just take a partner thats all believe me when we hid the cache we saw nothing that looked like an ice pick man we saw no killers we saw no mad man lurking in the dark okay so we did hear some spooky whispering further along our path but that could have just been the wind it could not have been the ice pick man okay so i suspect that you all are getting tired of me putting caches in tunnels and culverts well this is one that we teri mark and myself had done quite a while ago and i just never got around to getting it posted we hid the cache then wondered if it was even possible for anyone to physically be able to get to the cache eartrumpet made a huge physical effort just to get the cache placed i could not have climbed up in there i may not have even fit up there if i could have made the climb this is now stage 2 and you will not have to make the climb that he did but just look up there and see if you think you could do it this is by far the coolest of all the tunnels we have found todate recently when i went to post the cache page disaster struck the cache was too close to an existing cache i had to get some advice on how this could work and got some very good advice from a caching pro thanks webling so this cache has become a multi now please dont shirk away just because it is a multi weve made this as painless as possible as far as multis go rather than just going to the posted coordinates there are 3 stages along the way that take a very minimal extra amount of effort to accomplish over a traditional style cache you will just need to gather a little info along the way so that you can get the coordinates to the final stage and sign the log okay heres what you need to know 1 you will find the best parking at n 39deg 42317 w 084deg 11669 this parking spot will have you within a few hundred feet of stage 1 just a short walk down a good trail 2 at stage 1 youre looking for a number painted in roman numerals you will need to know that number to reach the final stage 3 once you have the number from stage 1 you should move a head to stage 2 that would be inside the tunnel you will know you are at stage 2 when you get there there will be a shaft that leads to the surface that is if it were not welded shut this is the part of the cache that you should keep and eye not only a head of you but behind you as well basically this is where we could hear the whispering voice as i said no such thing as the ice pick man but why be rash this is also where eartrumpet climbed up to make the original hide the container is still there if anyone would like to have a free container that is ready to be placed elsewhere 4 as you move a head from stage one to stage 2 you may notice a smaller pipe that enters the main culvert on the left side we found it better to shine our light in that pipe before we just reached in becuase it seems that that pipe has become a virtual snake pit some of you have seemed to like seeing snake skins and actual snakes along your journeys if so then you will love this spot the last time we checked the pipe there were no less than 6 snakes all sizes in there i know nothing about snakes so i dont know what kind they were but the light seemed to help keep them far back in the pipe 5 okay what else oh very important you will need to keep track of the number of blue doors that you see inside the tunnel between stage 1 and stage 2 including the ones in the snake pipe this is another number you will need to get to the final stage 6 stage 2 okay very important how many rungs are there leading up that shaft 7 thats it you are done oh you want to log this effort and prove you could do the cache well then the final stage coordinates are in the form n 39deg abc8d w 084deg 11669 where ab=number represented by the roman numeral the first stage + 12 c=number of rungs you saw at stage 2 d=number of blue doors between stage 1 and stage 2 including the ones in the snake pipe one last thing how people accomplish this cache is up to you you could share the coordinates to the final stage with your buds and then they wont have to go in the tunnel that would be sad because i think this will be a fun cache to do on your own well i still say take at least one person with you it is a tunnel with some water flowing it could be slippery it is dark but im sure that you should not need to worry about crazed killers lol since his is a multi please be careful not to give too

GC18V9A,35.88725,-82.27513,Type.earthcache,the geology the geologic history of the area is interesting about 380 million years ago the african continent was being forced toward the ancestral eastern north american continent by plate tectonic force the subduction or forcing down of the oceanic crust underneath the north american continent produced tremendous frictiongenerated heat from the two colliding continents this frictiongenerated heat in excess of 2000 degrees fahrenheit melted the surrounding rock 9 to 15 miles below the surface this igneous molten rock was generated under intense pressure that forced the molten rock into cracks and fissures of preexisting rock this molten rock under pressure is similar to hot hydraulic fluid being forced into a chamber due to the pressure exerted on the molten fluid it hydraulically pushed its way through the cracks of the host rock this opened the rock up along with melting contact areas of the host rock and sucking up rich mineral forming fluids as these cooled they crystallized and became a mineralrich buried treasure it then took an estimated 100 million years for this deeply buried and insulated mass to cool and crystallize the slowly cooling mineral crystals grew within the area to some of the largest feldspar and mica crystals in the world after molten emplacement and cooling it took millions of more years of appalachian mountain building and subsequent erosion to expose the deposits we see today along with muscovite mica feldspar plagioclase perthite and quartz occur at the ray mica mine other minerals reported are golden and aquamarine beryl apatite crystals clear oligoclase plagioclase feldspar amazonite thulite garnet autunite columbitetantalite tourmaline zircon and rutile area history the story of prospecting and mineral production in the area began before recorded time when the ancients mined for glittering mica during the woodland age 2000 years ago the ancients an early name given to the native americans by settlers of the area mined mica for grave decoration and wampum which they traded as money the mica is known to have been traded as far away as the ohio valley and is believed to have originated from native american mines in the spruce pineburnsville area now known as the clarissa ray and sinkhole mines legend is that this mining of mica led hernando desoto to the area around 1540 in search of mineral wealth that he thought to be gold and silver he found only silver mica better known as muscovite mica later around 1744 legend is that cherokee indians mined semiweathered feldspar mica and kaolin from the spruce pine pegmatites and used oxendrawn sleds to transport it to the coast where it was loaded on ships bound for england in england it was used as an ingredient for patented english ceramic wares from 1767 to 1911 mining of feldspar and mica occurred sporadically mica was mined to fuel the demand for the newlydeveloped edison electric motor in 1878 the motor required the electrical insulating properties of sheet mica feldspar and mica were being handmined at hundreds of holes pits and mines throughout mitchell avery and yancey counties which make up the spruce pine mining district until the mid to late1940s most work especially ore separation of minerals was done by hand with crude machinery and hand tools between 1944 and 1949 the process of chemical separation of minerals was jointly developed by the feldspar mining company the north carolina feldspar corporation the tennessee valley authority and the north carolina state mineral research laboratory of asheville this process led to the current large volume highcapacity process of separating the minerals of feldspar mica quartz and garnet from the rock ore todays uses mica comprises about 10 of the rock mass in the area once highly valued for wood and coalburning stove windows often called isinglass and for radio tube insulators during both world wars it is now used as an industrial products special additive muscovite which is silver to white mica variety is mostly ground to a fine particle size it is valued for its flat particle shape it is used mostly as a major ingredient of drywall joint compound or sheet rock joint cement muscovites flat particle shape and light color allow it to serve as an antishrinking agent for the cement after it is applied to sheet rock joints it applies as smooth damp putty but because of muscovite micas flat particle shape it interlocks the mud as it dries therefore reinforcing the mud as it dries without shrinkage it also acts as a fire retardant within the sheet rock joint mica is also produced for use as special electrical insulators automobile metallic flake paint womens makeup and as a reinforcing additive in special plastics and paints it is used in oil well drilling fluids to seal and lubricate the bore hole during drilling be aware that the listed coordinates will bring you near a relatively deep mica shaft though it is fenced off you should be careful while in the area there are many shafts in the area so watch your step in order to fulfill the requirements for this earthcache you must do three

make sure you wear hunter orange during the hunting seasons click here do be careful around the sinkholes and dont enter them the park is only open from sunrise to sunset do not walk on the often very slick steel grates that cover the cave this unique area while walking up to the cave you will cross the primary first fence and immediately notice the sinkhole off the left as you walk up to the caves first entrance this tells us that the cave goes both to the east and to the west eventually this sinkhole will open up to show another entrance to this cave this sinkhole looks to be about 45 foot deep and has about 20 foot diameter once you reach the caves main triangle box entrance you will notice that the 6 foot high triangle box is also attached to an area of flat laying steel grate to the east under this flat laying part you will notice a punchbowl seat erosion feature which is along the north wall of the cave this is caused by slash erosion and shows how powerful this type of erosion can be a little further to the east there is another section of flat laying steel grate covering the entrance area that was created when the caves roof collapsed you can see the rocks laying on the cave floor erosion erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the earths surface by natural processes such as wind or water flow and then transported and deposited in other locations types of erosion splash erosion small soil particles are detached and sent airborne through the impact of raindrops on soil sheet erosion raindrops break apart the soil structure and its moved downslope by water that flows overland as a sheet rather than definitive channels this occurs frequently during cloud bursts rill erosion this process develops small shortlived concentrated flow paths these paths create a sediment source and delivery system for hillslope erosion areas where precipitation rates exceed soil infiltration rates are more prone to this type of erosion gully erosion water flows in narrow channels during or directly following heavy rains or melting snow the gullies can erode to considerable depths valley or stream erosion continual water flow alongside land along a linear feature creates this type of erosion it extends downward deepening a valley and headward extending the valley into the hillside this occurs most frequently in times of flooding bank erosion over time banks of rivers and streams are naturally worn down freezing and thawing cold weather causes water trapped in tiny rock cracks to freeze and expand breaking the rock into several pieces wind erosion is a major geomorphological force especially in arid and semiarid regions wind erosion is of two primary varieties deflation where the wind picks up and carries away loose particles and abrasion where surfaces are worn down as they are struck by airborne particles carried by wind mass movement is the downward and outward movement of rock and sediments on a sloped surface mainly due to the force of gravity mass movement is an important part of the erosional process and is often the first stage in the breakdown and transport of weathered materials in mountainous areas it moves material from higher elevations to lower elevations where other eroding agents such as streams and glaciers can then pick up the material and move it to even lower elevations massmovement processes are always occurring continuously on all slopes some massmovement processes act very slowly others occur very suddenly often with disastrous results source water karst topography karst topography is a geological formation shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite subterranean drainage may limit surface water with few to no rivers or lakes many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes being the most common however distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by glacial debris or confined by one or more superimposed nonsoluble rock strata some karst regions include thousands of caves although evidence of caves large enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst types and formation a cave or cavern is a hollow place in the ground especially natural underground space large enough for a human to enter caves form naturally by the weathering of rock and often extend deep underground solution caves solutional caves are the most frequently occurring caves and such caves form in rock that is soluble such as limestone but can also form in other rocks including chalk dolomite marble salt and gypsum rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through beddingplanes faults joints and so on over geological epochs cracks expand to become caves and cave systems primary caves caves formed at the same time as the surrounding rock are called primary caves lava tubes are formed through volcanic activity and are the most common primary caves as lava flows downhill its surface cools and solidifies hot liquid lava continues to flow under that crust and if most of it flows out a hollow tube remains examples of such caves can be found in the canary islands jejudo the basaltic plains of eastern idaho and other places kazumura cave near hilo hawaii is a remarkably long and deep lava tube it is 656 km long 408 mi how caves form cave formation begins when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it falls through the atmosphere rain water must have carbon dioxide to become acidic it must be acidic to chemically react to the limestone bedrock rainwater is absorbed by the soil into the ground as rainwater comes through the soil it absorbs more carbon dioxide that is being produced by plants that are dead this changes the ground water to a weaker form of carbonic acid h2o + co2 = h2co3 as it travels down through the ground it comes to solid rock when the rock is limestone or dolomite caves can form the water reacts chemically with limestone and slowly a larger and larger space will form this happens because the rocks are made of calcium carbonate caco3 this is what you call chemical erosion as the space becomes larger and larger the water can flow through as it flows it erodes physical erosion washes away rock and sand this is what makes a cave larger and forms an underground stream finally over hundreds of thousands of years or even millions of years the cave is formed logging requirements do not post answers in your log send the following answers to me via

GC4ZA0G,38.3628,-84.6442,Type.mystery,for those of you unfamiliar with the legend of the lost dutchman mine we decided to recreate the legend here in these woods we have hiked about every trail in the superstition mountains and find them fascinating and full of adventures as a young precocious child my father drove us past the superstition mountains one evening as the sun was setting and told us about the legend of the lost dutchman mine it has always fascinated me so i thought i would share it with you the superstition mountain range which is a roughed mountainous region full of mystery and legend lies just east of phoenix arizona according to legend and historical records within the superstitions lies a gold mine like no other that has ever been seen it is known as the lost dutchman mine and has been the quest of many an adventurer over the years and also a place of doom to luckless others what strange energy lingers here numerous people have either vanished without a trace or have had their remains discovered in the desert most recently the remains of a man from denver colorado were discovered in 2012 after he sought out locating the gold mine in 2009 the apache indians say it is the thunder god the protects this mine the first man to discover gold at the mine was don miguel peralta a prominent family member from sonora mexico he described the mountains most outstanding landmark resembling a sombrero to others it has been referred to as the finger of god early explorer pauline weaver etched his name in the rock with a knife and subsequent prospectors discovered the etching and dubbed the landmark weavers needle peralta returned to mexico and gathered men and material to work the mine soon he was shipping millions of pesos in pure gold back to sonora the apaches grew angry over the spanish presence on the mountain in 1848 peralta got word of their impending attack so he pulled the men from the mine packed up his burros and wagons and elaborately concealed the entrance to the mine to wipe out any trace that they had ever worked there the following day the apaches attacked and massacred the men the pack mules scattered and spilled the gold from their saddle bags as they ran away the area was later dubbed gold field because it was scoured by men seeking the rotted leather packs still brimming with raw gold jacob waltz emigrated to the us from germany and relocated to arizona in the 1860s pursuing mining and prospecting the word dutchman came about because americans back then referred to those settlers as being related to the pennsylvania dutch he heard stories from the local indians about the vast deposits of gold in the nearby superstition mountains legend tells that he located the lost mine and its valuable gold by 1891 waltz became sick and befriended an old mexican widow named julia elena thomas who owned a small bakery in phoenix he promised to take her to this secret mine in the spring but she never saw it because he died on october 25 1891 with a sack of rich gold discovered beneath his deathbed before he died he told her that the gold mine can be located by gazing at weavers needle the sun will cast a shadow from weavers needle onto the entrance to the gold mine immediately following his death large hoards of people scoured the mountains in search of the mysterious gold mine but no one ever found it there is no way to estimate how many people have died in pursuit of the lost dutchman mine the peralta massacre death numbers vary between 100400 men in addition to the number of others who died or disappeared in the following years to as recently as the colorado mans death in 2012 jacob waltz so are you up to the challenge to discover the gold buried here in central kentucky if so locate the needle at gz stare into the needle straight ahead and you will see a large tree downhill in the distance walk to this tree and go around to the back of the tree search the spot and hopefully you will locate the gold and earn that golden smiley here

climate so there are recreation opportunities year round for hiking and biking the appalachian trail isnt far and theres skiing in the nearby blue ridge mountains the book history of the city of roanoke 1968 asserts that the locality derives its name from the spring which has its source in a cave lying on the north side of route 221 old cave spring road used to be 221 so now the spring is on the south side of 221 the spring branch augmented by several other springs flows westwardly about a mile until it enters a bottom this bottom was early known asmuddy lick because some of the spring waters had a saline content animals came here to lick the salt impregnated mud as they did at big lick roanokes original name this bottom is the source of mud lick run which flows north to empty in the roanoke river in the norwich section of roanoke city just north of the intersection of mud lick road and route 11brandon avenue in howes historical collections of 1845 mention is made of the bones of a mastodon unearthed in the big lick bottom and exhibited for many years on the porch of pates store intersection of i581 and orange ave roanoke county was formed out of botetourt county in 1838 with a county population of approximately 5000 an original deeds map of the cave spring area shows the region divided by tracts belonging to david stewart 1754 jasper terry 1756 and william preston 1773 by a deed from richard and elizabeth woods dated december 9 1790 for a consideration of 110 pounds esom hannan became owner of 400 acres of the david stewart grant the area begins near the foot of sugar loaf mountain and runs southeasterly to embrace all the village of cave spring as it was the 1950s esom declined into senility and conveyed five acres including the cave spring to david and john ferguson in 1840 five years after the incorporation of the town of gainesboro which would become big lick in 1874 yes the spring has flowed even since before these early times when native americans and forest creatures were its only visitors the survey mentions a school house which stood on the hill behind the cave spring now brambleton avenue in 1854 a presbyterian church of brick was built on the hill over the cave spring near a clum of trees this building was demolished some years ago the current owners of the spring have collected rusty relics of these bygone buildings in history of the city of roanoke 1968 the author is impressed by the number of springs found in the village for from nearly every house bold springs bubble then dance away in sparkling branches west to join and form mud lick creek on its dash to the roanoke river doubtless this is the reason one often hears cave spring referred to in the plural on september 30th 1911 robert f wyatt moved back to roanoke after performing construction work on the shenandoah valley railroad several branches of the norfolk western as well as projects that took him to washington dc and the island of jamaica the book history of roanoke county 1912 records he purchased the cave spring property with an intent to improve and perhaps capitalize on the spring the water of which pocesses fine medicinal qualities the history of the city of roanoke reveals how this plan turned out it mentions wyatt bought the old berry store which was a landmark at the intersection of electric road and brambleton avenue the store dates back to the founding of roanoke county and also originally had a blacksmiths shop the store passed through several hands to joseph w berry then wyatt we read mr wyatt built himself a handsome residence operated the store and tried unsuccessfully to find some medicinal virtues in the water of the cave spring when the store was demolished to widen the intersection it was discovered to have been built of logs and weatherboarded over berry lane near the area is the only lasting testament today to this early enterprise in 1917 the spring property was purchased from robert wyatt by albert beauregard rasnake it then passed to his son w b rasnake his wife was interviewed by the roanoke times in 1980 at the age of 79 regarding the spring on sundays youd think it was a circus going on the way people used to stop at the spring to get water a large oak once crowned the tall face of the rock that shielded the spring but the oak is gone a victim of long ago storms according to her she never entered the spring but her husband wielding a torch would walking and walking until he finally got to where the spring tapered to just a big hole in a rock the source has never been found throughout the 20th century many roanokers were accustomed to hiking to cave spring to picnic by its waters and drink from its cool dark depths on some saturday nights young men in the vicinity sloshed into the cave with some apple brandy and settled into the echoing chamber to see who could sing the loudest i took a look in the cave in 2010 and the point where the ceiling tapers into the water is only about 20 from the entrance i did not venture further into this chilly fragile ecosystem but we did venture a few songs the rasnakes likely built the log cabin still standing near the spring and also installed many wildflowers which can still be found in bloom delmar burnette purchased the spring in 1972 and it has changed hands since a more recent article in the roanoke times mentioned oldtimers still living in the area who testify to the springs medicinal qualities several other nearby localities were named in honor of their hydrological features such as virginia etna springs warm springs hot springs white sulphur springs and botetourt springs resort which became the nucleus of hollins college another important spring was big cook spring in bonsack an area heavily damaged by the civil war recent cave spring history roanoke county was the first locality in virginia to have curbside recycling in december 2006 the first led billboard of its kind in the roanoke metro area doused nearby businesses and brambleton avenue in its otherworldly glow initially the billboard sparked some concerns as engineers adjusted its luminance from blinding down to a more normal level and since then residents have overwhelmingly embraced the technology i mistook it for the sunset on my way home from work that first evening the high definition billboard is at the nearby intersection of old cave spring road and brambleton avenue an interesting fact is that according to a history of roanoke and roanoke county there has never been a tornado in the roanoke area in recorded history however on the night of june 3rd 2008 a severe thunderstorm with some rotation unleashed its fury upon south jefferson street and the 2200 block of brambleton avenue in the city

GC1WVZP,36.3912,-82.36823,Type.earthcache,the entrance to the cave was originally just a small hole there are two types of caves primary and secondary caves primary caves are formed at the same time as the surrounding rock like lava tubes secondary caves are formed inside the rock after the rock has formed there are several types of secondary caves sea caves glacier caves and solutional caves to name a few the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with h2co3 carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes sinking streams and underground drainage limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation including the most common and wellknown stalactites and stalagmites these secondary mineral deposits in caves are called speleothems solutional caves may form anywhere the rock is soluble you may not be able to find this 247 it is hard to get a picture at night anyway and the park closes at dust so please make sure you have time to hike the trail and then to the second set of coordinates for the trail you will need to get to the cave without much bush whacking second coordinates so you do not have to bush whack are as following north 36 23469 west 82 22073 types of caves a simple classification of caves includes four main types and several other relatively less important types a solution caves are formed in carbonate and sulfate rocks such as limestone dolomite marble and gypsum by the action of slowly moving ground water that dissolves the rock to form tunnels irregular passages and even large caverns along joints and bedding planes most of the caves in the worldas well as the largestare of this type b lava caves are tunnels or tubes in lava formed when the outer surface of a lava flow cools and hardens while the molten lava within continues to flow and eventually drains out through the newly formed tube c sea caves are formed by the constant action of waves which attacks the weaker portions of rocks lining the shores of oceans and large lakes such caves testify to the enormous pressures exerted by waves and to the corrosive power of wavecarried sand and gravel d glacier caves are formed by melt water which excavates drainage tunnels through the ice of entirely different origin and not to be included in the category of glacier caves are socalled ice caves which usually are either solution caves or lava caves within which ice forms and persists through all or most of the year now the difference in a rock shelter is as followeda rock shelter is a shallow cavelike opening at the base of a bluff or cliff another term is rock house rock shelters form because a rock stratum such as sandstone that is resistant to erosion and weathering has formed a cliff or bluff but a softer stratum more subject to erosion and weathering lies just below the resistant stratum and thus undercuts the cliff unaka mountains because the bedrock here consists of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks it is typically rather resistant to erosion as you might expect some rock types erode more readily than others so significant relief ie rugged topography steep slopes is evident nonetheless however due to 1 resistance of these rocks to erosion 2 uplift associated with the orogenies of the past and 3 subsequent isostatic movements the elevation throughout this area is generally 1000s of feet above sea level note my crosssection transects an area of the unakas with relatively low elevations 2000 ft or so to log this earthcache you must post a picture of you holding your gps with the cave in the background and email me the answers to the following questions1 what are the dimensions of the opening of this cavefloor to ceiling and side to side2 what natural substance is covering the floor of this cave3 what is your opinion on how this cave was formed4 after reading the above text and studying the physical area do you think this should be called a cave or a rock shelter

runs beside the ec if you encounter heavy carriage traffic or want to linger at the cache you may want to park in the perpendicular whites alley that is just south of the building that was built over the cave plese see dmflyers photo of the alley thanks to him for the pic in 1760 while traveling on an extended hunting trip from his home in kentucky daniel boone decided to camp in the area now known as abingdon va daniel with one of his dogs at one point during daniel boones stay in the area a pack of wolves emerged from a nearby cave and attacked the hunting dogs that were with his party this attack gave boone the idea to give abingdon its first name wolf hills the cave entrance where the pack of wolves emerged is located on the eastern slope of court house hill just a few yards from main street it was at the bottom of court house hill where boone and his fellow hunters made their camp the cave later became known as the wolf cave and runs under what is locally known as the cave house many years ago explorers were allowed to enter the cave and it reportedly runs for many yards under the city of abingdon naturally it would be better if we could enter the cave but the owners rights must be respected by peering through the slabs of the latticework you will be treated to a wonderful cave entrance and a view of early american history how are karst area caves formed limestone caves are formed by erosion as rainwater falls through the atmosphere it absorbs co2 creating carbonic acid this slightly acidic rainwater erodes limestone flowing water above or below the surface which had become slightly acidic dissolves the calcium in limestone to form caves this flow forms what is known as a solution cave after the water has receded lower water table pockets andor rooms are formed when the room is formed the rainwater that has percolated through the ground drips off the roof of the cave some of the calcite from the limestone is deposited and this eventually forms a stalactite where it hits the floor of the cave and rises upward it becomes a stalagmite while the majority of caves are formed but not exclusively from limestone and are referred to as solution caves there are other types of caves sea caves are formed by the constant action of waves that wear weaker portions of rocks lining the shores of large lakes and oceans glacier caves are formed by melt water which excavates drainage tunnels through the ice another class of caves formed by frozen water is commonly referred to as ice caves these caves may also be partsolution cave but the ice remains year around the last type of cave is what is known as a lava cave these caves are volcanic and are tunnels or tubes in the lava that form when the outer layer of the lava cools and becomes hard molten lava may continue to flow through the tube and finally exits leaving a hollow tube entrance to the cave caves like the wolf cave and others in this area are definitely solution caves parts of southern virginia and most of tennessee are termed karst topographies the karst environment is one of mostly limestone above and below the surface this limestone is eroded by slightly acidic water and as a result sinkholes sinking creeks and of course caves are formed other rocks such as dolomite and marble can be eroded in the same fashion but limestone is by far the more common rock found in an karst topography limestone was originally living sea organisms the organisms died settled became compacted and over a many million of years formed this light to dark gray rock limestone is primarily calcium carbonate and is termed a sedimentary rock which is one of the three major rock types the other two are metamorphic and igneous rocks speaking of rocks be sure to note the foundation blocks of the

rock types and caused by widely differing geological processes caves range in size from single small rooms to interconnecting passages many miles long the scientific study of caves is called speleology from the greek words spelaion for cave and logos for study it is a composite science based on geology hydrology biology and archeology and thus holds special interest for earth scientists of the us geological survey waterfall classification types of waterfalls are based on how the water falls or passes through its course how much water is flowing the surface beneath it and the geological processes that created it geomorphology these all together form a waterfalls unique shape its fingerprint so to speak block sheet water from a wide river or stream drops over a ledge forming what appears to be a sheet of water ideally it is not broken into segments at high water and it is observably wider than tall cascade cascade is a commonly used term when referring to waterfalls and rightly so the term cascade comes from the italian word cascada which actually means waterfall a cascade type waterfall is defined by the surface beneath it it is one of the most common as the surface beneath it is irregular and encompasses the falls not classified elsewhere it is generally water that flows down in small steps or stages multicascading is more than one cascade in a row cataract another word for waterfall but usually one that is large very powerful and rushes down with force usually occurring on a river chute a violent section of water that is forced through a narrow passage due to cliff walls or large rocks depending on the descent angle they may be classified as rapids not a waterfall very common in canyons where the water is walltowall classical similar to block water drops over a ledge but is close to equal in width and height combination many waterfalls are a combination of more than one type of falls at paulina creek falls you will find curtain slide segmented and scree talus curtain similar to block and classical water drops over a ledge but is taller than wide but not a ribbon dry historic this type of falls no longer exists with water flowing over it it is referenced here as some of these historical falls were very magnificent in their time dry falls in washington is one of these type and in its day it was over 3 miles wide and had a huge flow of water the unique thing about this falls was that it only flowed when the glacier lifted up to release the water fan water falls through a relatively narrow crest and spreads out and becomes wider as it descends frozen these falls can be of any other type and it must have ice as a part of the falls they are spectacular as the ice formations are just as unique as the falls themselves if the temperature is just right punchbowl falls will often form a cone in the bowl of water horsetail water descends down remaining in contact with the surface most of the time keyhole slot water pushes through a narrow area before falling a keyhole is a special slot as it has a rounded part at the bottom of the slot resembling the old fashioned keyholes some times the water has forced eroded out a part of the rock causing an actual hole water falls from ledge a geological formation that influences shape of waterfall it is a cliff that is relatively flat with some width at the top and is vertical or almost vertical angel falls and niagara falls are great examples of a ledge the following shapes types often result from a ledge overhanging ledge another geological formation that influences shape of waterfall it is a cliff that the water has eroded under it causing an obvious overhang resulting in the water free falling to the surface below parallel twin parallel falls happen when falls are sidebyside and fall similar to each other there can be two or more falls and can be from the same watercourse also see segmented falls or from more than one watercourse twin falls are also sidebyside but do not have to be similar in type triple and more falls exist as well plunge vertical water descends vertically without contact with the surface punchbowl water falls through a constricted area and descends down into a pool of water the water punches through and falls into a bowl ribbon water descends in a narrow strip significantly taller than it is wide segmented pieces of land segment the river same watercourse causing the water to fall in sections not to be mistaken with different watercourses forming different waterfalls sidebyside as in parallel twin falls scree talus water flowing over a chaotic mix of rock debris on a slope usually found at the base of a cliff or steep incline scree is usually the rocks that are smaller than a softball and talus is larger than a softball slide water glides over a single slab of rock maintaining smooth continuous contact tiered staircase multistepped separate waterfalls falling consecutively and in close proximity so generally they can be seen together any type of falls can be tiered veil water falls over rocks usually large rocks creating a thin layer of water that just barely covers its surface arches general description window or arches are natural holes that form along cracks and weak spots in thin walls of rock called fins by convention these holes must be at least 3 feet in diameter in two perpendicular directions to earn the name arch or window an imprecise distinction is often made between bridges and arches in terms of the processes that form them its important to remember that gravity is the key factor in either case nevertheless the distinction is that bridges are carved by flowing water whereas arches can be carved by everything else except flowing water indeed in very few circumstances is it possible to say that flowing water had zero contribution in the development of one of these natural holes therefore geologists often prefer the term window to collectively describe any large hole in a rock i love this area and thought it needed an earthcache and wanted to give something back to all the cachers who have placed caches in the

GC18V7J,34.6432,-88.14067,Type.earthcache,welcome to cave spring cave spring is an existing attraction along the natchez trace parkway in northeast mississippi it is a feature that is a combination of a cave and sink hole originally it existed as a cave in the form of a large roomcorridor just under the surface at one point the roof of the room weakened and collapsed the result is what you see today which are two openings to caves that border the sink hole feature in the middle parking is located within one hundred feet of the feature a cement walkway is provided that leads people to several observation stands for optimal viewing it is wheelchair accessible all along the upper observation area there are steps down to the walkway that runs alongside the cave openings however it is not necessary to descend to the lower walkway to complete this earthcache there are no access fees or access restrictions all you have to do is get there the site is located less than one mile west of the mississippialabama border it is about a 45 mile northeasterly drive from tupelo mississippi take us45 north and then natchez trace parkway north it is about a 35 mile southwesterly drive from muscle shoals alabama take us72 west and then natchez trace parkway south when visiting this location do not leave the walkway under no circumstances should you attempt to enter the cave openings the caves are dangerous they contain deep pools into which you could fall also the water is not safe to drink how caves are formed caves are formed in many ways by far the most common way is by the dissolution of sedimentary rock by acidic water that is the process that formed the caves here at cave spring there are other forces that can create caves following are the descriptions of several rainwater by far most of the caves in the world were formed by a process supported by rainwater the rainwater seeps into the soil until it reaches the water table which is where the soil rock or other material is saturated with water the water which has become acidic possibly from various sources eats away at the rock at the bottom of the water table eventually forming channels the larger a channel becomes the more water it holds and the faster this dissolution process progresses typically a cave forms over a period of several million years later the water table can drop leaving the void of the cave and the expansion of the cave channels stops waves over time waves crashing against the base of a cliff can form a sea cave a sea cave forms along a vertical zone of weakness in the rock perhaps a crack or an area of softer rock the erosive power of the waves wear away the rock creating an opening that can deepen and expand with an overhang where the cliff rises above the waves sea caves are typically found in sedimentary rock such as sandstone and limestone they are less commonly formed in hard rock such as granite lava lava which is molten rock on the surface of the earth can create long intricate cave systems when lava flows it typically flows down a slope in a shape that resembles a long skinny tongue the tongue is a channel of flowing lava with the hotter fasterflowing lava in the center of the channel and the cooling lava closer to the edges of the channel the cooling lava on the edges solidifies forming walls and eventually a crust over the top of the lava flow when the eruption stops the remaining lava flows out of the voids and a tubelike cave remains additional lava flows can occur over the top of the cave burying the cave deeper and deeper bacteria there are bacteria that thrive on oil deposits deep within the earth these bacteria which are named extremophiles because they thrive in extreme conditions expel a gas that combines with oxygen to create sulfuric acid this highly corrosive acid eats away at limestone leaving behind gypsum and creating the large voids of caves this bacterial process can feed upon itself with some of the bacteria eating the byproducts and other minerals accelerate the formation of caves manmade the word cave implies a feature created by natural forces therefore there really is no such thing as a manmade cave we have other words to describe the holes that humans have created in the earth humans have dug holes for many reasons including shelter passage mining disposal battle escape etc the cave feature at cave spring is obviously not a sea cave there is not a lot of volcanic activity going on around here either it certainly is not manmade i suppose it is possible that those wacky bacteria could have done it but that just isnt the case here this cave feature was formed by rainwater becoming groundwater getting all acidy and dissolving the rock it was formed by the same process that has formed most of the caves in the world historically the native americans that lived in this area used cave spring as a source for water rock and shelter today however as stated before the water is not safe to drink what you must do to complete this earthcache now on to the tasks that you must complete items you should bring with you include a camera and a pen and paper the tasks you must complete are listed below requirement 1 photo in front of a cave opening you must post a photo of yourself with one of the cave openings appearing in the background of the image i dont care about your gpsr being in the image please be careful to ensure that neither of the informational signs appear in the photo you must post your photo with your find log requirement 2 answer questions about the sink hole at the site you will encounter a large sign and a small sign closer to the caves you will find the small sign that describes the process of the formation of the sink hole between the two cave openings from this small sign answer the following questions in your email to me 1 what is the basic type of rock in this area 2 what two substances combine to form an acid that eventually dissolves that rock 3 do you think that the leaf litter and surface material that becomes trapped in the fissures contributes to the dissolution process and if so in what way this is an open question for which you need to provide your own answertheory ie you have to use your brain and think about it requirement 3 answer question about the cave from the large sign answer the following question in your email to me 1 based on the ground surface and the type of rock involved this cave was a result of what logs not accompanied by email within a reasonable amount of time will be deleted per earthcache rules i dont like doing that so please be careful to get done what you need to get done remember your three simple requirements photo email answers about sink hole and email answer about cave have fun special information the

8200 dragline and a ph 2800 shovel for overburden removal and reclaims about 120 acres of land annually history mississippi lignite mining company was formed in 1997 to supply lignite coal to the red hills power plant mississippi lignite mining company is an affiliate of the north american coal corporation the largest lignite producer in the united states north american coal and its affiliates operate 6 lignite surface mines producing over 33 million tons annually and also provides dragline services for limestone quarries in south florida the red hills power plant which supplies electricity to tennessee valley authority under a 30year contract agreement is owned and operated by choctaw generation llp an affiliate of suez energy generation north america construction of red hills mine and facilities began in august 1998 development of the initial boxcut began in april 1999 and the first lignite was mined in december 1999 geology the lignite at red hills mine is found within the wilcox formation in ms this formation extends southeastward from memphis to meridian in a belt that is approximately 10 miles wide geologically speaking it is a young formation in that it is only 57 million years old the lignite seams at red hills mine were formed in a fluvial stream environment in which several sequences of flooding and stream channel migration occurred it was during these periods that swampy conditions occurred and organic matter was deposited over time this organic matter was buried and compressed into lignite geologists have found that it takes approximately 16 feet of organic matter to make 1 of lignite the ms geologic survey estimates mississippis lignite reserves to be 80 billion tons the red hills mine is the first large scale user of this plentiful resource environmental compliance land stewardship the red hills mine conducts coal mining operations in strict compliance with a surface coal mining and reclamation permit submitted to and issued by the mississippi department of environmental quality this permit contains a detailed inventory of natural resources prior to mining a detailed description of how the resources will be effected or protected during mining how mining will be conducted and how the land and other natural resources will be restored or reclaimed to productive and useable conditions after mining has been completed the mine is also required to operate in compliance with many other local state and federal laws and regulations relating to county road closures and relocations surface and ground water quality and water use archeological and historical resources wetlands rare and endangered plants and animals radio transmissions solid waste disposal and dam design most of the mined land at the red hills mine is being restored to loblolly pine forest as requested by area landowners small openings green patches are designed into upland forested areas and drainage bottoms are reclaimed to include hardwood plantings enhanced stream channels small wetland areas and ponds important for local fish and wildlife resources the mine has also constructed and manages a 75acre recreational fishing lake stocked with bass bream catfish and crappie the mine actively manages reclaimed land until it can be returned to the owners care generally a period of at least 5 years after all mining and reclamation is complete as required by mining regulations uncovering and handling the lignite a p h 2800 40 cubic yard electric shovel uncovers the top seam of lignite the shovel loads the material into caterpillar 785 and 789

have some part which does not receive daylight however in popular usage the term includes smaller spaces like sea caves rock shelters and grottos millions of years ago much of the state of iowa was covered by a shallow sea deposits of tiny marine animals and plants on the sea floor formed thick layers of limestone when exposed to weather these layers of limestone became the worlds best cave forming rock rainwater mixed with carbon dioxide in the air and soil formed a mild acid which slowly worked its way into cracks in the limestone and began to dissolve passages most people dont realize that caverns are important ecosystems which harbor a variety of rare and endangered species cavern systems also contain significant archeological artifacts fragile mineral formations and easily contaminated water supplies caves are susceptible to vandalism looting by artifact hunters and just plain carelessness when exploring the water and animal life in caves can easily be impacted by sewage illegal dumping in sinkholes uncontrolled soil erosion chemical spills and agricultural run off devils kitchen and crinoid cavern are both manmade the work of a mining company starrs cave once extended for hundreds of yards underground it may have been used to shelter escaped slaves as part of the underground railroad and might have been a hideout for a gang of horse thieves in the 1850s today much of the cave has collapsed leaving a 100yardlong tunnel that is home to several species of bats cave explorers will want to take flashlights and should be prepared to crawl most of the way the cave is closed from october to april to protect hibernating bats starrs cave park preserve is part of the audubon societys great river trail and is considered an excellent place to see migrating

protected by law which forbids the removal of any rocks fossils or artifacts from the park sign at cave entrance more recently the cave has been used by people in 1876 the hawkeye reported that outlaws were hiding out in the cave it has been a popular place for scout troops to visit today hundreds of people every year crawl more than 100 yards to the back of the cave besides fossils you may also see stalactites hanging from the ceiling or bats sleeping overhead if you crawl all the way to the back which might be a tight squeeze for some there is a room starrs cave bats as many as six species of bats mostly big and little brown bats red bats grey bats and the endangered indiana bats roost in the cave in the summer time and hibernate here in the winter the cave maintains a fairly constant 55 degree temperature year round offering relief from summer heat and warmth in the cold winter the cave is to cold to shelter snakes and most insects most peoples fears about bats are based on myth none of the bats here are dangerous to humans they all eat insects and help protect against mosquitos and agricultural pests if you see a bat in the cave leave it alone so that it can keep

GC1PYAH,34.67807,-118.65168,Type.traditional,about a quarter mile above the benco mines is the reputed site of the gillette mine at least it is so marked on the liebre mountain topo the forest service apparently cleared the area of debris in 1979 mining operations started there in the late1920s by king camp gillette with his only child king gaines gillette playing a major role he or his son had obtained an old map that showed the location of spanish mines and buried treasure they brought in a bulldozer and ploughed up a chumash burial ground hoping to find one of the hidden mines but nothing was ever found the senior gillette passed away in 1932 in poor health and in bad financial shape his widow and son spent their last years in extreme poverty after his death mining efforts continued with some members of the hollywood movie community involved including tom mix the cowboy star according to mr benz there was violence and shootings during this period over conflicting mining claims things finally quieted down after the forest service closed the mines of course king camp gillette is not well known for his mine he is most remembered as the founder of the gillette razor blade company king camp gillette was born in 1855 in the small town of fond du lac in central wisconsin his parents were innovators who were always seeking to do things better his father worked at various inventions and his mother created numerous recipes through experimentation in 1859 at age four his family moved to chicago illinois where his father started up a hardware business in 1871 when he was 16 the great chicago fire destroyed their business the gillette family then moved to new york city his father became a patent agent kings father often described the various inventions that came across his desk he also continued to dabble in his own creations the idea of inventing something that would make him rich inspired king the following year king left school to begin working for a living as a traveling salesman gillette worked for years as salesman often trying his hand at various inventions to improve the products he sold in 1887 when he was 32 kings mother published the famous white house cookbook which was still in print 100 years later by 1890 he had accumulated four patents but none of the inventions gathered much interest meanwhile his parents seemed so much more successful than him in 1894 at the age of 39 gillette had become bitter about societyperhaps due to his own shortcomings and apparent failure to become successful in life he wrote an anticapitalist book called the human drift in which he criticized business practices and the rich in the book he stated that competition was the root of all evil and proposed a form of utopian socialistic society that was pollution free he hoped to replace the sprawling cities that the industrial revolution had created with beehive type communities then the following year in 1895 at the age of 40 gillette was back to his roots in fond du lac wisconsin working as a salesman for crown cork seal co the owner of the company had invented the corklined bottle cap he knew gillette wanted to be a successful inventor so he gave the advice to invent something people use and throw away this thought stuck in the back of gillettes mind shortly afterwards as he was ready to shave before going to work king became irritated that his straightedge razor was dull and would no longer cut it was so worn out that he could no longer sharpen it the straightedge razor was also called the cutthroat razor because it was dangerous enough to cut a mans throat salesmen traveling in swaying trains had to be especially careful when trying to shave gillette suddenly had a flash of inspiration of a razor that would not need stropping and honing to sharpen it he had an idea of disposable razor blades that were sharpened by the manufacturer and thrown away when dull it would also be a razor that was safe to use as opposed to the dangerous straightedge razor excited by his idea he went to the massachusetts institute of technology mit as asked their metallurgists if it were possible to make a small piece of steel that would hold its sharp edge and be affordable to throw away they said it was impossible undaunted he spent evenings working on his idea he then partnered with inventor william emery nickerson to perfect the method ironically nickerson had been educated at mit it took them 5 years and much of their own money to finally find someone who could provide a machine that would automatically sharpen thin sheets of metal so they could be used to shave gillette was now 45 years old they eventually perfected the doubleedged safety razor blade which fit into a specially designed holder with a handle and an adjustable head gillette and nickerson set up the american safety razor company and got their patent in 1901 when gillette became 48 in 1903 they finally started selling the razors at first the cost of making the blades was more than the selling price so they sold at a loss to build up enough business to reduce the manufacturing cost then gillette had the fantastic idea of giving away his razors for free in order to sell more of his blades this was part of a massive marketing campaign in 1904 he received a patent for the idea of a doubleedged razor he also renamed the company the gillette safety razor company competitors tried bypassing the patents and copied many of gillettes ideas he then spent an enormous amount of time and money in litigation to protect his rights in many cases he simply bought out the competitors by the age of 55 in 1910 the gillette company dominated the razor business and gillette was a millionaire he was also a celebrity since his face was on every package of razor blades sought utopia he still didnt change his anticapitalist views after he had become one himself gillette still dreamed of a utopian society organized by engineers he tried to get teddy roosevelt to become president of his new society and elicited the support of henry ford they both declined the stock market crash of 1929 just about wiped out gillettes fortune he was also made powerless in his company by boardroom machinations he spent the years from age 74 until he died at age 77 in 1932 in an unsuccessful enterprise to extract oil from shale thanks to hugh blanchard ron

GC1VA65,29.5087,-98.45708,Type.earthcache,robber baron cave is one of the most significant of the over 500 bexar county san antonio tx caves it is the longest known cave in the county with 4961 feet of mapped passages this cave has many interesting features including a large sinkhole entrance a geologically complex twodimensional maze of passages a rich history and several unique species which live only underground robber baron cave probably has an origin related to the edwards aquifer even though the cave is in the austin chalk limestone biological studies have discovered several blind invertebrate species found nowhere else on earth in december 2001 two of these species were listed as endangered by the us fish and wildlife service usfws the cave is also the only one in the county that has been open to the public as a tourist attraction when from 1926 to 1933 an estimated 300000 people toured the cave as san antonio grew the cave became part of a densely urbanized area and subject to problems of vandalism graffiti and unauthorized visitation acquired by tcma in 1995 robber baron is now protected as a karst resource to not only preserve its unique biology geology and history but also to provide a place where people can learn about and experience the underground environment robber baron cave is a maze cave with a complex set of interconnected passages that generally intersect at right angles the cave is found within the austin chalk formation which underlies must of northcentral bexar county the austin chalk is one of the upper confining layers of the edwards aquifer and in the location of the cave is an upthrown fault block it is a soluble formation meaning that water flowing through small cracks can over long stretches of time dissolve the rock in contrast to physical erosion austin chalk is also relatively soft and rather claylike and less soluble in its upper layers it appears that the cave may have formed in two periods the first one of which established the basic layout of passages a second period followed after the cave opened to the surface when runoff played a role in enlarging some passages while partially filling others with sediments there are several theories to explain the origin of the cave its speleogenesis one involves aggressive water flow near locations of constrictions in the main flow floodwater mazes another states that slow and dispersed flow through an upper rock layer that is not soluble could form such caves diffuse recharge recently a new theory has been proposed that explains maze caves as a result of ascending transverse speleogenesis in this theory water from an underlying aquifer is hydraulically forced up into overlying beds of rock the water then travels horizontally through fractures in this bed for long distances along multiple paths if fractures that are differently oriented exist in the overlying bed the water may be forced up into these and form crossing passages characteristic features of this theory of speleogenesis are the presence of small orificelike feeders which are small rounded ear canal like openings in the floors of passages along with cupolas which appear as a series of small domes in the ceilings of these passages robber baron has numerous such feeders and cupolas and local conditions make the other theories unlikely the cave maintains a near constant temperature of 6870 degrees f although this may sound pleasant the relative humidity is near 100 which leaves no place for sweat to evaporate air flow in this cave as with most caves is dependent on local barometric conditions as air pressure falls such as from a passing storm the lower pressure outside will draw air out of the cave causing a breeze in passages toward the entrance during periods of rising pressure the reverse is true some small passages deep inside the cave also exhibit airflow indicating the presence of cave passages beyond that which are known one of the main features of the cave is the presence of significant amounts of carbon dioxide co2 in certain parts of the cave known as bad air these areas tend to be in cutoff or lower sections of the cave where circulation is less and where co2 which is heavier than air can pool co2 levels generally seem to be worse in the summer months than the winter more frequent pressure changes from cold fronts along with a greater temperature differential may combine to help flush out the co2 in winter during the summer some portions of the cave may be problematic to enter as the high co2 levels can result in extreme shortness of breath even when not moving along with dizziness and disorientation these symptoms disappear quickly when returning to areas near the entrance although a headache may remain after entering an especially bad area one theory regarding the origin of the co2 is that it may arise from chemical reactions of water with the surrounding rock or alternatively that it may be outgassing from lower rock layers within the aquifer the formation and development of caves is known as speleogenesis caves are formed by various geologic processes these may involve a combination of chemical processes erosion from water tectonic forces microorganisms pressure atmospheric influences and even digging most caves are formed in limestone by dissolution speleothems in hall of the mountain king ogof craig a ffynnon south wales solutional caves form in rock that is soluble such as limestone but can also form in other rocks including chalk dolomite marble salt and gypsum the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with h2co3 carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes sinking streams and underground drainage limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation these include flowstones stalactites stalagmites helictites draperies soda straws and columns these secondary mineral deposits in caves are called speleothems the worlds most spectacularly decorated cave is generally regarded to be lechuguilla cave in new mexico lechuguilla and nearby carlsbad cavern are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave they were formed by h2s hydrogen sulfide gas rising from below where reservoirs of oil give off sulfurous fumes this gas mixes with ground water and forms h2so4 sulfuric acid the acid then dissolves the limestone from below rather than from above by acidic water percolating from the surface karst topography is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite due to subterranean drainage there may be very limited surface water even to the absence of all rivers and lakes many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes or dolines being the most common however distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by glacial debris or confined by a superimposed nonsoluble rock strata some karst regions include thousands of caves even though evidence of caves that are big enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst to get credit for this cache answer the following questions this cave is found in an upraised section of what formation what was discovered here that is found nowhere else on earth using your

GC1WVZP,36.3912,-82.36823,Type.earthcache,the entrance to the cave was originally just a small hole there are two types of caves primary and secondary caves primary caves are formed at the same time as the surrounding rock like lava tubes secondary caves are formed inside the rock after the rock has formed there are several types of secondary caves sea caves glacier caves and solutional caves to name a few the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with h2co3 carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes sinking streams and underground drainage limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation including the most common and wellknown stalactites and stalagmites these secondary mineral deposits in caves are called speleothems solutional caves may form anywhere the rock is soluble you may not be able to find this 247 it is hard to get a picture at night anyway and the park closes at dust so please make sure you have time to hike the trail and then to the second set of coordinates for the trail you will need to get to the cave without much bush whacking second coordinates so you do not have to bush whack are as following north 36 23469 west 82 22073 types of caves a simple classification of caves includes four main types and several other relatively less important types a solution caves are formed in carbonate and sulfate rocks such as limestone dolomite marble and gypsum by the action of slowly moving ground water that dissolves the rock to form tunnels irregular passages and even large caverns along joints and bedding planes most of the caves in the worldas well as the largestare of this type b lava caves are tunnels or tubes in lava formed when the outer surface of a lava flow cools and hardens while the molten lava within continues to flow and eventually drains out through the newly formed tube c sea caves are formed by the constant action of waves which attacks the weaker portions of rocks lining the shores of oceans and large lakes such caves testify to the enormous pressures exerted by waves and to the corrosive power of wavecarried sand and gravel d glacier caves are formed by melt water which excavates drainage tunnels through the ice of entirely different origin and not to be included in the category of glacier caves are socalled ice caves which usually are either solution caves or lava caves within which ice forms and persists through all or most of the year now the difference in a rock shelter is as followeda rock shelter is a shallow cavelike opening at the base of a bluff or cliff another term is rock house rock shelters form because a rock stratum such as sandstone that is resistant to erosion and weathering has formed a cliff or bluff but a softer stratum more subject to erosion and weathering lies just below the resistant stratum and thus undercuts the cliff unaka mountains because the bedrock here consists of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks it is typically rather resistant to erosion as you might expect some rock types erode more readily than others so significant relief ie rugged topography steep slopes is evident nonetheless however due to 1 resistance of these rocks to erosion 2 uplift associated with the orogenies of the past and 3 subsequent isostatic movements the elevation throughout this area is generally 1000s of feet above sea level note my crosssection transects an area of the unakas with relatively low elevations 2000 ft or so to log this earthcache you must post a picture of you holding your gps with the cave in the background and email me the answers to the following questions1 what are the dimensions of the opening of this cavefloor to ceiling and side to side2 what natural substance is covering the floor of this cave3 what is your opinion on how this cave was formed4 after reading the above text and studying the physical area do you think this should be called a cave or a rock shelter

GC1X71W,36.71335,-81.96862,Type.earthcache,sign in front yard since one cacher had a problem with parking we thought we would address the obvious most cachers will simply park in plumb alley which runs beside the ec if you encounter heavy carriage traffic or want to linger at the cache you may want to park in the perpendicular whites alley that is just south of the building that was built over the cave plese see dmflyers photo of the alley thanks to him for the pic in 1760 while traveling on an extended hunting trip from his home in kentucky daniel boone decided to camp in the area now known as abingdon va daniel with one of his dogs at one point during daniel boones stay in the area a pack of wolves emerged from a nearby cave and attacked the hunting dogs that were with his party this attack gave boone the idea to give abingdon its first name wolf hills the cave entrance where the pack of wolves emerged is located on the eastern slope of court house hill just a few yards from main street it was at the bottom of court house hill where boone and his fellow hunters made their camp the cave later became known as the wolf cave and runs under what is locally known as the cave house many years ago explorers were allowed to enter the cave and it reportedly runs for many yards under the city of abingdon naturally it would be better if we could enter the cave but the owners rights must be respected by peering through the slabs of the latticework you will be treated to a wonderful cave entrance and a view of early american history how are karst area caves formed limestone caves are formed by erosion as rainwater falls through the atmosphere it absorbs co2 creating carbonic acid this slightly acidic rainwater erodes limestone flowing water above or below the surface which had become slightly acidic dissolves the calcium in limestone to form caves this flow forms what is known as a solution cave after the water has receded lower water table pockets andor rooms are formed when the room is formed the rainwater that has percolated through the ground drips off the roof of the cave some of the calcite from the limestone is deposited and this eventually forms a stalactite where it hits the floor of the cave and rises upward it becomes a stalagmite while the majority of caves are formed but not exclusively from limestone and are referred to as solution caves there are other types of caves sea caves are formed by the constant action of waves that wear weaker portions of rocks lining the shores of large lakes and oceans glacier caves are formed by melt water which excavates drainage tunnels through the ice another class of caves formed by frozen water is commonly referred to as ice caves these caves may also be partsolution cave but the ice remains year around the last type of cave is what is known as a lava cave these caves are volcanic and are tunnels or tubes in the lava that form when the outer layer of the lava cools and becomes hard molten lava may continue to flow through the tube and finally exits leaving a hollow tube entrance to the cave caves like the wolf cave and others in this area are definitely solution caves parts of southern virginia and most of tennessee are termed karst topographies the karst environment is one of mostly limestone above and below the surface this limestone is eroded by slightly acidic water and as a result sinkholes sinking creeks and of course caves are formed other rocks such as dolomite and marble can be eroded in the same fashion but limestone is by far the more common rock found in an karst topography limestone was originally living sea organisms the organisms died settled became compacted and over a many million of years formed this light to dark gray rock limestone is primarily calcium carbonate and is termed a sedimentary rock which is one of the three major rock types the other two are metamorphic and igneous rocks speaking of rocks be sure to note the foundation blocks of the building that was erected over the cave entrance note in order for you to claim a find please complete the following 1 post a photo of yourself with your gpsr pointing to and the cave in the background if there is a reason for not wanting to be in the photo make sure your gpsr and the cave are shown obviously the cave is behind the lattice work 2 via email only answer these questions a estimate the width and height of the cave entrance your guess must be within 10 feet if it is a dark day you may want to bring a strong flashlight b what colors do you observe in the cave entrance rocks c what type of rock are the building foundation blocks while they have mentioned several times above best guesses accepted this is the spot we sincerely hope you enjoy this little bit of geology and history on a quiet night some tell of still hearing the howl of wolves coming from deep within the cave we dont advise making your visit after dark besides not being able to see into the lattice building you never know what may appear as old daniel would say good hunting ps we never did learn who won the fight between daniel boones dogs and the wolves best guess especially looking at the

a bit as thats the direction the mining is progressing there is no need to go onto any private property everything you need can be obtained from this location you dont even need to get out of your car coal is a brownishblack sedimentary rock that is normally found in layers or veins called coal beds plants growing in swampy areas provide yearly layers of plant material that over time accumulate because they remain under water and mud they are kept from fully decaying and their carbon material is preserved over time the plant materials were changed by geological action to create a solid material coal coal a solid hydrocarbon is a sedimentary rock but the harder forms such as anthracite coal can be regarded as metamorphic rocks because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure coal is composed primarily of carbon with various other elements including sulfur hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen there are several grades of coal without getting into the subspecifics there are three main categories lignite bituminous and anthracite ranked based upon their heat energy potential higher ranked coal contains more concentrated carbon than lower ranked coal the evolution of coal is as follows peat an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation lignite sometimes referred to as brown coal has characteristics between that of peat and coal bituminous coal a soft coal containing a tarlike substance called bitumen a midlevel coal its regarded as being better than lignite but not as good as anthracite anthracite a hard compact coal it is shiny and has the highest carbon content and the fewest impurities coal is a fossil fuel it is the largest source of fuel used to generate electricity in the world coal powers about 40 of electricity generation worldwide and about 50 in the united states the united states has about 27 of the worlds coal reserves texas is the 5th largest producer of coal in the united states energy from coal can be produced much more economically than from other fossil fuels its main drawback is that burning it produces large quantities sulfur mercury and carbon dioxide more than petroleum and about double that of natural gas the greenhouse gas responsible for global warming coal is extracted from the ground by either in underground mines or in open pits depending upon how deep the coal is located from the surface lignite has characteristics of both peat and coal its considered the lowest grade of coal and is almost exclusively used as a fuel for power generation lignite is geologically younger than the other forms of coal mainly originating in the tertiary period ~ 65 million to 25 million years ago it is brownishblack in color and has a carbon content of 25 35 lignite often has a high content of volatile materials and a high moisture content because of spontaneous combustion issues transportation and storage issues become problematic because of its low energy characteristics it is not cost effective to transport long distances and is often burned in power stations located close to the mine the coordinates take you to the roadside with a view of the kosse mine if you travel farther to the west you will see the rail lines and the loading facility the mine is expected to produce several hundred million tons of coal over three to four decades at the rate of about 25000 tons per day about 92 million tons per year if you look at the map above of coal producing regions you will see the white band representing lignite deposits across a potion of texas kosse mine is in that zone the curve of the lignite band represents the position of the shores and shallow inland regions of the gulf of mexico shortly after the gulf opened up when north america split away from south america since that time erosion has carried sand clay and other sediment from farther inland on the continent and continuously deposited it into the gulf filling it in and extending the continent to make todays shoreline at the time when the shore was where the current lignite band is shown plant material near the shore and inland in marshy areas was deposited around the edge of the gulf the area was swampy in between river drainages similar conditions can currently be found on a drive from houston to galveston over time erosion inland on the continent allowed sediments to be carried toward the gulf the shoreline extended further and further south and sediment eventually also covered the peat eventually the peat turned into lignite as part of the evolution of coal that lignite is what is currently being mined in kosse 50 million years from now there may be a similar lignite band between houston and galveston to get credit for this earthcache 1 you should post a photo of yourself or hold up your gpsr with a view of the mine in the background feel free to post lots of photos i cant make you under the new rules but please post a photo dont send them to me in the message system post them 2 send me an email and answer the following questions a is this a surface mine or underground mine b how tall do you think the walking dragline crane for us laypeople is and how did you guesstimate it c how deep below the surface does the coal appear to be at the end closest to the road and at the farthest point from the road in other words how much sediment or overburden is on top of the layer of coal at each point d bonus question where does the coal go to once its on the trains additional resources see info on the big digger here see the dragline walk across the road here congrats to kirbydox fendmar and

liquid and argyros meaning silver and atomic number 80 a heavy silvery dblock metal mercury is one of six chemical elements that are liquid at or near room temperature and pressure12 the others being caesium francium gallium bromine and rubidium mercury is the only metal that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure with a melting point of 3883 degc and boiling point of 35673 degc mercury has one of the narrowest ranges of its liquid state of any metal mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar mercuric sulfide which is the source of the red pigment vermilion and is mostly obtained by reduction from cinnabar cinnabar is highly toxic by ingestion or inhalation of the dust mercury poisoning can also result from exposure to soluble forms of mercury such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury inhalation of mercury vapor or eating fish contaminated with mercury mercury is used in thermometers barometers manometers sphygmomanometers float valves and other scientific apparatus though concerns about the elements toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alcoholfilled digital or thermistorbased instruments it remains in use in a number of other ways in scientific and scientific research applications and in amalgam material for dental restoration it is used in lighting electricity passed through mercury vapor in a phosphor tube produces shortwave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor to fluoresce making visible light geology the rockville park is underlain with volcanic material and most of the exposed bedrock you see consists of the pliocene sonoma volcanics which is made up of tuff basalt and andesite these volcanic rocks overlie sandstone tuffaceous sandstone and volcanic conglomerate of the pliocene age tuff is a type of rock consisting of consolidated volcanic ash ejected from vents during a volcanic eruption tuff is sometimes called tufa particularly when used as construction material although tufa also refers to a quite different rock this location appears to be basaltic tuffs from volcanic activity where eruptions have long since ended tens of thousands of years ago the mouth opening of the mine is basalt lined it is very sturdy and is likely the reason this opening is still here in spite of the erosion in the area biological impact and errosion charatorisitcs of mercury a very important factor in the impacts of mercury to the environment is its ability to build up in organisms and up along the food chain although all forms of mercury can accumulate to some degree methylmercury is absorbed and accumulates to a greater extent than other forms inorganic mercury can also be absorbed but is generally taken up at a slower rate and with lower efficiency than is methylmercury the biomagnification of methylmercury has a most significant influence on the impact on animals and humans fish appear to bind methylmercury strongly nearly 100 percent of mercury that bioaccumulates in predator fish is methylmercury most of the methylmercury in fish tissue is covalently bound to protein sulfhydryl groups this binding results in a long halflife for elimination about two years as a consequence there is a selective enrichment of methylmercury relative to inorganic mercury as one moves from one trophic level to the next higher trophic level the term biomagnification refers to the progressive build up of some heavy metals and some other persistent substances by successive trophic levels meaning that it relates to the concentration ratio in a tissue of a predator organism as compared to that in its prey methylmercury is a central nervous system toxin and the kidneys are the organs most vulnerable to damage from inorganic mercury severe neurological effects were already seen in animals in the notorious case from minamata japan prior to the recognition of the human poisonings where birds experienced severe difficulty in flying and exhibited other grossly abnormal behaviour significant effects on reproduction are also attributed to mercury and methylmercury poses a particular risk to the developing fetus since it readily crosses the placental barrier and can damage the developing nervous system in birds adverse effects of mercury on reproduction can occur at egg concentrations as low as 005 to 20 mgkg wet weight eggs of certain canadian species are already in this range and concentrations in the eggs of several other canadian species continue to increase and are approaching these levels environmentail impact example the levels of mercury in arctic ringed seals and beluga whales have increased by 2 to 4 times over the last 25 years in some areas of the canadian arctic and greenland in warmer waters as well predatory marine mammals may also be at risk in a study of hong kongs population of humpbacked dolphins mercury was identified as a particular

need four things one a sense of adventure two a compass three binoculars and four a gpsr go to the coordinates listed and answer the questions below you should park down the road a ways from the coordinates and walk to the coordinates you will be on the side of a county road and not on private property be careful please this is not a heavily trafficked road but there are some fast moving vehicles so stay off the road way there is a nice concrete walkway on the off road side of the guardrail to show that you have visited this mine and to receive credit for this earth cache answer the following 1 look on both sides of the road from the coordinates there is a blue sign on the road going into each mine what is the msha number and the permit number for each mine what is the specific four word name of this mine and specifically what do they mine here hint read the earth science section below 2 what are the machines doing that have dirt not coal in the beds hint they are not mining coal 3 look in the mine take a picture of the huge dragline working there and estimate its boom length this dragline moves around so you will have to locate it you can post this picture on your log if you wish but please do not post any answers 4 around the property you will see huge piles of material that looks like dirt what is this material called in mining and what will they do with it earth science a coal is not technically a mineral because of one of the rules of being a mineral but is a huge part of the geology of our planet coal was formed organically mostly from plant and animal remains that were pressed under tons of pressure for millions of years and became coal there are four general types of coal mined in the us lignite subbituminous bituminous and anthracite lignite has the lowest btu of the four and is mostly used for the generation of electricity it is also the most common type of coal b in general coal forms from the remains of plants which died in prehistoric swamps and wetlands organic plant matter at various stages of decay form peat which under certain pressure time and heat conditions experiences slow rates of bacterial decay and eventually goes on to form coal as peat is buried by sediment and becomes compressed it slowly releases water and other elements contained within it resulting in an increasingly compact and carbon rich substance the natural process converting plant matter to peat may go through different stages first forming lignite then sub bituminous coal bituminous coal and eventually anthracite coal when we mine coal from the earth it may be at any of the above mentioned stages of formation which contain increasing levels of carbon below we examine some of the characteristics of each rank lignite lignite coal is the lowest ranked coal for its heat energy producing capability and carbon content a soft brownish coal lignite contains the highest levels of moisture of the coal types and is known for its crumbly texture lignite deposits are the youngest of the coal types and have undergone the lowest intensity of heat and pressure sub bituminous with higher carbon content and thus a higher heating value than lignite sub bituminous and bituminous coal collectively make up the majority of coal produced in the united states sub bituminous coal contains less water and is therefore harder than lignite facilitating easier transportation and storage the relatively low sulfur content in sub bituminous coal makes it an attractive option for power plants bituminous estimated to be between 100 and 300 million years old bituminous coal makes up the majority of coal mined in the us bituminous coal is heavily utilized for energy in power plants and for the production of steel anthracite having the highest concentration of carbon anthracite is also the hardest coal anthracite coal is known to be the cleanest burning coal but is one of the rarest being found mainly in limited reserves in pennsylvania local geology you can tell from the earth science above that this area in a geology timeline is younger than that of pennsylvania because of the different kind of coal that is found here lignite verses the anthracite found in pennsylvania c coal fired generating plants produce approximately 75 of all the electrical energy we use from the coordinates look sw about 230 degrees and you will see the generating plant that uses the coal from this mine this energy produced here goes on the grid and is used by millions d the vein of coal that this mine works on runs from louisiana through texas to mexico an 800 mile vein of coal the closest mine to this one is across the border in mexico did you know this vein of coal existed e this mine reclaims hundreds of acres a year they do a good job of reclaiming the land with the overburden and haulback look under the bridge you are standing on and you will see an example

mounds takes its name from the blue mounds two large hills which have long been wisconsin landmark features cave of the mounds lies under the southern slope of the east mound this area was first settled by ebenezer brigham he was the first permanent white settler in 1828 on august 4 1939 workers on brigham farm discovered a cave when blasting for limestone the workers were amazed by the large opening in the rock they had no idea that they had been farming and working the land on top of this exceptional geological find for many years since this discovery many have been curious and excited to see the cave formations cave of the mounds was designated as a national natural landmark in 1988 because the site possesses exceptional value as an illustration of the nations natural heritage and contributes to a better understanding of mans environment this cave has been referred to as the jewel box of americas major caves for the variety and delicacy of its formations lights and wooden walkways were installed so that visitors could see the cave without destroying the natural features every year in august the cave has a special discovery days celebration to mark the anniversary the science of cave of the mounds the cave was formed within limestone a sedimentary rock formed from compacted seashells and other marine sediments these were deposited in wisconsin long ago when shallow seas covered the continent the seas receded leaving the layers of rock behind and erosion began to wear them down today the exposed rock in blue mounds is a limestone called galena dolomite which is a specific kind of limestone containing at least 20 magnesium the cave was formed when the galena dolomite was beneath the water table rainwater and melting snow absorbs carbon dioxide making the top layer of the water table acidic this can dissolve the limestone and create cavities in the rock when there is a major crack that lets large amounts of this acidic water into the limestone even larger amounts of the rock is dissolved this cave was formed along a major crack that can still be seen in the cave called the lifeline of the cave underground streams and surface water continued to reshape the cave drops of water leave calcite crystals on the cave ceiling walls or floor the crystals adhere to each other and grow into different kinds of formations called speleotherms this happens very slowly it can take 50150 years to deposit one cubic inch of cave onyx stalactites and stalagmites stalactites are pointed pendants hanging from the cave ceiling from which they grow stalagmites are the groundup counterparts of stalactites often blunt mounds stalactites are speleotherms which form on the ceiling of a cave all stalactites begin as hollow circles when crystals of calcite form around the outer surface of a droplet of water hanging from the ceiling as each new drop of water appears it leaves another crystal ring soon long crystal soda straws hand from the ceiling these tubular stalactites grow into cones of icicles if the initial tube becomes plugged and the crystals form around its outer surface visitor information to log this cache you will not actually have to

of the mother lode long known to native americans the cave has also had a convoluted history of use by euroamericans and was the site of one of the first cave dives in the united states the cave consists of a collapse sinkhole in marble nearly 100 feet in both diameter and depth with a small pool at its bottom formerly a bower of maple trees partly canopied this large roofless chamber several short decorated passages can be reached by exciting climbs up the walls an enormous submerged passage only accessible by cave diving leads over 800 feet into the hillside bordering the merced river dropping to at least 240 feet deep the cave continues inward and downward but to follow it would require extreme cave diving expertise the early human history of the bower cave area has been difficult to unravel at least 3500 years ago the area was occupied by people who roamed both the great central valley and the sierra nevada foothills these folks were truly the first california cavers burying their dead in many other mother lode caves while we know little about their culture they probably viewed the cave as a portal to the otherworld it is likely that they explored the cave but left no evidence of their passing the northern mewuk arrived in the area about 1200 years ago though the tribe feared caves they called this one ootins and considered it to be one of the places from which humans emerged into the world the recent history of bower cave began just after the gold rush of 1849 on march 19 1851 a miner known only as shore went looking for lost horses and reported finding a large spring in a lime deposit along the north fork of the merced river he also mentioned that he found and explored a very remarkable cave in the ledge christening it marble springs cave jeannicolas perlot a belgian gold seeker may have found the cave at about the same time but his remembrance of dates is somewhat suspect lacking modern vertical gear shore shinnied down one of the immense maple trees covering the outer vault as the collapse sinkhole was called aprons and notches the speleogens of bower cave the southeast wall of bower caves outer vault has an outstanding record of the caves geologic history on display faint traces of the originally horizontal bedding of the paleozoic age marble are visible as nearly vertical bands along the overhanging part of this wall their skewed and folded orientation reflects the nearly quarter billion years of inexorable tectonic forces crumpling the rocks of the sierra nevada along the west coast of california stacked notches vertical walls and aprons reflect the slowly and sometimes not so slowly dropping ground water that dissolved out this huge cavern the older overhanging walls record a steady enlargement as the ground water began to drain from the caves uppermost chamber we now call the outer vault sections of vertical wall are the result of steady lowering of the ground water narrow horizontal slots reflect short stops in the waters withdrawal allowing deeper lateral solution of the marble the lower walls are made of several narrow and one very wide aprons formed as the water fell at a rapidly increasing rate probably caused by entrenchment of the adjacent merced river and solution slowly waned the massive dripstone in the background frames the entrance to the bat roost a domed room now reoccupied by pale townsends bigeared bats corynorhinus townsendii pallescens these decorations date from when the cave chambers breached the surface after this momentous event the cave atmosphere equilibrated with the outside and seeping waters dropped their mineral load as the ground water providing buoyant support for the roof drained away the roof itself collapsed leaving the tablesized mosscovered breakdown blocks littering the floor red terra rosa soil has cascaded down through fissures appearing as a reddish river at the far end of the largest apron originally four huge broadleafbigleaf maple trees acer macrophyllum grew in the outer vault these were used by the first indian and white explorers of the cave to negotiate the overhanging 30meter drop into the outer vault only one remains visible at the upper left of this photograph a relic of years long past mosses ferns green algae and a host of other moistureloving plants cover the walls and floor during the wet winter season a long series of owners many immigrant frenchmen and germans subsequently bought commercially developed and sold the cave over the next 100 years nearly everyone suspected the cave extended underwater but only brief glimpses were possible of a darkened hole leading down through the pellucid waters but in march 1953 jon lindbergh son of charles lindbergh the first transatlantic flyer brought some new fangled aqualung gear to bower cave jon studied at stanford university and had used scuba equipment for several years hed met ray desassure and other members of the now nearmythical stanford grotto there and was persuaded to visit bower cave although the use of scuba was beginning to be common in open water diving few dared enter caves jon lindberghs dive was the first cave dive in the west and came shortly after the first us cave dive in florida in late 1951 donning his thin frogman suit and single air tank he dove into the frigid waters of the cave swimming under a natural bridge of jagged ceiling pendants jon swam into the cave some 39 ft then gradually descended nearly 121 ft to a mudcovered breakdown floor then followed his air bubbles up about 65 feet into a blackened void breaking the waters surface he found himself in a large chamber some 46 ft in diameter and nearly 60 ft high unfortunately without any beach or landing spot the domed ceiling rose up out of sight some 20 feet above the pool a high ledge was festooned with white stalactites flowstone and draperies jon paddled around a bit then chilled by the 50of water returned to the outer vault the organizers were delighted and newspapers ballyhooed his dives across california on later dives jon along with sterling pierce of the western speleological institute explored inwards for nearly 350 ft to a depth of 124 ft art lange used their notes and sketches to draw a detailed block diagram of the cave

a longtime resident and moonshiner in the area who discovered the cave around 1899 it is rumored ed put up the deed to his property in a poker game and ended up with the second best hand but lost the pot and property in 1921 william crawford a local metaline merchant acquired the land around the cave and deeded 40 acres of it to washington state parks later that year for this reason the park carries his name gardner cave with a slope length of 1055 feet is the third longest limestone cave in washington state access to the cave is by conducted walk with park staff crawford state park is a

within 100 yards of parking limestone caves about 500 million years ago all of the continents as we know them now were one supercontinent called pangaea see picture below during this period much of north america was covered by an ocean when the sea creatures died their shells bones and coral settled to the bottom forming limestone ooze this ooze eventually turned into a rock called the metaline limestone about 70 million years ago as mountains were forming this rock was folded and uplifted and during this process it developed cracks and voids to form a limestone cave water must be present above the limestone as in a stream rains or in this case mostly glaciers limestone will dissolve in acid such as the acid formed when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide mostly from seeping through the soil even though carbonic or sulfuric acid is a weak solution when it seeps into the ground and limestone over millions of years it will cause small cracks to enlarge as the limestone is carried away in solution this process will enlarge the cracks and then produce larger and larger voids if the source of water is a stream it may disappear above ground and find an exit through the limestone downhill the erosion of both the acids and water will carve out large passages huge caverns see below speleothems speleothems are natures special effects to a hole in the ground water seeping through the ground and cracks in a limestone caves surrounding bedrock may dissolve certain compounds usually calcite and aragonite both calcium carbonate or gypsum calcium sulfate the rate depends on the amount of carbon dioxide held in solution on temperature and on other factors such as the vegetation above the cave when the solution reaches an airfilled cave a discharge of carbon dioxide may alter the waters ability to hold these minerals in solution causing its solutes to precipitate or seep over time which may span tens of thousands of years the accumulation of these precipitates may form speleothems speleothems are the shapes and forms that you will see in a limestone cave which are made up of precipitate of minerals each cave you tour will have a claim to fame about something special about their cave to make it special or unique here is a classification of speleothems dripstone since mineral rich water is dripping into the cave from the roof stalactites may form stalactites hang down from the roof of the cave and the water dripping on the floor below the stalactite may form a stalagmite given enough time they will grow towards each other until they touch and become a column gardner cave has one of the best and unique column i have seen in any cave sometimes a basin is formed is formed in the top of a stalagmite or the floor of the cave pearls can be found in some basin and are round deposits that look like pearls soda straws are formed when the drip of water and calcite is deposited on the outside of the drip the following drips go down the center of the straw or tube making them longer and longer sometimes the water dripping from the ceiling onto the floor will not form a stalagmite but will splash on the floor and creates ridges which will trap the water into rimstone pools bacon is formed when the drips follows a horizontal path before it falls remember these formations may take hundreds of thousand years to form and the color of the speleothems may change because of what the water dissolves and holds in suspension as it reaches the cave flowstone when water does not drip but flows across the ceiling walls and floors of the cave and forms features it is called flowstone these flowstones create many shapes textures and colors in the feature it is like looking at clouds you may find all sort of shapesyou are only limited to your imagination as to what you see i took a picture of a formation and when i got home i could not believe it it looked like a sleeping seal pup being watched by two weasels with neck collars see below it also depends on your angle of view and lighting kids love to make up things and are better than adults at it and they see many more some of your questions will ask you about these features of the cave that will be pointed out by the guide so know your questions curtains or draperies are massive walls of flowstone tens of feet across from ceiling to floor sometimes they look like pipes of an organ look at the floor and you will see waves on the floor created by the water flowing over it caves are classified by being alive or dead a live cave still has water entering into it during all or part of the year and the creation and building of the formations is still going on a dead cave is a dry cave and there is no formation building even though a cave is classified as dead it can still have spectacular formations to experience if climate changes dry cave may turn wet and a wet dry and through the eons both may have changed many times i never pass a cave if they have a tour and i always come away awed by what i see and experience gardner cave is classified as a young cave in age and even though the tour is less than 900 feet it is loaded with features you would only find in longer caves since gardner cave is a living cave be very careful not to touch any of the formations as you may break part of a formation oil in your skin can cause a change in the color and the water will flow around the oil spot and can change the shape even a piece of lint floating around and landing on a formation may change the shape one of the problems we face with nature is how to enjoy it without harming and changing it and caves are no exception so look but do not touch earthcaches are educational in nature and i hope you look at the pictures and read some of the references to get a better understanding of caves just google caves and you will even get a listing of caves with tours south of butte montana is lewis and clark cave which would make a weekend getaway if you head south

trail to get to this cache this earthcache location will take you on a beautiful hike in wyalusing state park to a unique geological feature pictured rock cave pictured rock cave is a sandstone outcropping as with any geocache you can earn a find for this earthcache if you complete the requirements listed at the bottom of the page rock you see in wyalusing state park was formed over hundreds of millions of years around 570 million years ago the cambrian ocean flooded the southern twothirds of wisconsin sand accumulated on the bottom of the ocean and water pressure and chemicals turned the sand particles into sandstone the sandstone that formed during this period is 110 feet thick and lies under the mississippi river the cambrian ocean receded about 500 million years ago and was soon replaced by the ordivician sea once the ordivician sea formed tiny shelled creatures in it fell to the bottom when they died thirtyfive million years of this accumulation of shells turned into limestone also called dolomite due to the pressure of the water and chemical reactions the ordivician sea became shallow 460 million years ago and once again sand collected at its bottom this turned into what we now call st peters sandstone the sea deepened again and after another 20 million years of those dead tiny shelled creatures accumulating at the bottom additional limestone was created you can still find many of these tiny creatures as fossils when you pick up and look at pieces of limestone the ordivician sea receded about 430 million years ago and no new rock has formed here since as you walk down the path to pictured rock cave you will be retracing the footsteps of native american and early settlers during earlier times pictured rock cave offered protection from the elements and relief from the heat for native americans and early settlers at one time the walls of the cave had indian paintings pictographs and indian carvings petroglyphs however over time and also due to vandalism the pictoglyphs have disappeared carving initials names or anything on the sandstone walls is strictly prohibited by law please help preserve the beauty of this special place take nothing

allouez conglomerate eight million pounds of copper were removed from this mine the mine had 5 shafts that reached a depth of 1400 ft with 10 different levels as you walk the ground level area of the mine evidence remains of waste discarded by the mine figure 1 waste rock pile at the delaware mine photo by paul t brandes cache coordinates n 47deg 25410 w 088deg 06121 earthcache lesson why is there copper in the keweenaw peninsula a precambrian midcontinent rift formed around 11 billion years ago over the next 100 million years layers of volcanic and sedimentary rocks were deposited into the rift valley then hot water moved through the rocks filling the open pore spaces with native copper and other minerals geologist call this hydrothermal mineralization the copper is commonly found in the permeable layers of conglomerate between the sand and pebbles the keweenaw peninsula has two types of copper deposits lode deposits and fissure deposits the lode deposits comprise of conglomerate lodes rocks held together by copper and amygdaloidal lodes almondshaped deposits in the top layer of lava flows figure 2 bedrock geology map this map illustrates where copper conglomerates are located source <url> the fissure deposits are veins along fractures that parallel or cross the beds originally the delaware mine started as a fissure vein mine the ground was poor but there was enough copper to continue mining that site mining fissures was difficult for the miners to remove the large pieces of copper later miners started to mine conglomerate loads because the copper was easier to remove and more consistently found than in the fissure copper lodes the conglomerate loads could be mined more efficiently with the ore blasted out taken to the surface and then railroaded to stamp mills even though the conglomerates were rich in copper only about 2 of the ore rock hauled to the surface was copper the remaining rock was called poor rock and set in piles near the mine or hauled away and put to other uses another waste product of mining was stamp sand stamp sand is still a problem plaguing the keweenaw peninsula what are the properties of copper copper is an element and a mineral copper would appear red in color on a polished fresh surface and it would appear dull brown on a tarnished surface due to oxidation if you were to scrape copper on a streak plate the streak color would be red copper has a metallic luster copper is not a hard metal ranked 253 on mohs hardness scale copper could be scraped by a nail piece of metal or quartz however copper is hard enough that you will not be able to scrape it with your finger nail if you find copper in the rock pile it would most likely be irregularly shaped and less than three inches in size logging your visit to obtain credit for visiting this earthcache please email me a brief response to the following questions 1 left over from mining are piles of rocks with little mineral value called poor rocks look through the poor rock pile and describe the rocks you find there include the size range and color of the rocks 2 see you if can find copper in the pile using the information about coppers properties how will you know if you have found copper 3 find another mineral from the rock pile that is not copper how do you know its not copper how are its properties different from copper earth science vocabulary ore a

press 1966 mary dedecker writes beveridge which was the most important gold producing district in inyo county has remained the most inaccessible its mines and mills tucked into a maze of canyons on the precipitous east face of the inyo mountains were reached only by trails occasional springs were the only source of water and they were few and far apart in some instances the flow was enough to create running streams in the canyons before being lost in the thirsty gravel such places were blessed with streamside trees willow cottonwood or even oak as a whole however wood was extremely scarce except for a fair amount of pinyon at higher elevations and a fringe of bristlecone and limber pine on the peaks most of the important requirements for mine production were scare or missing but the gold was there so hardy miners appeared on the scene and proceeded to overcome the obstacles the keynot group of seven claims on the ridge north of keynot canyon made the record for the greatest production in the district it also had the most extensive development including seven tunnels from 150 to 750 feet long its deepest mine went down 1800 feet ore was carried three miles by pack mules to a fivestamp mill in beveridge canyon formerly hahns canyon in later years a tramway was built this amazing accomplishment of transporting heavy mill machinery so far by trail paid off in savings of costs for carrying ore beveridge camp below the junction of cave and beveridge canyons was and still is by far the most inaccessible of the mining camps of the inyos hence it has had few visitors since it was abandoned and shortage of water along the route makes the trail a difficult one according the bureau of mines records the keynot mine was founded in 1878 and operated continuously through 1883 then intermittently until 1906 there was some exploration work done in 1937 but no ore was processed in 1983 the far west exploration company flew in by helicopter a 250 ton cyanide gold recovery plant and began mining the dump a large bulldozer was also brought in by helicopter piece by piece and assembled on site where it remains today the operations were suspended later in that year when it was determined that insufficient water resources were available to sustain operations under the licenses the company was granted keynot mine consisted of four quartz monzonite veins these veins were as thick as 5 feet averaging 21 feet in thickness the veins branch and are segmented by the numerous faults in the area near the surface the veins are primarily leached drusy quartz with gold at depth the gold occurs as discrete particles and as particles associated with chalcopyrite and pyrite and with small amounts of galena and sphalerite the workings of the mine totaled more than 10000 feet in thirty underground shafts that followed the veins of ore in addition there were more than 20 small pits and exploratory cuts 9 cabins an air concentrator and a cyanide mill bureau of mines records indicate that at least 29000 onces of gold worth about $500000 were recovered from the mine in the 1878 to 1906 period mineral descriptions druzy a coating of fine crystals on a rock fracture surface

GC4TTHM,40.24713,-95.51918,Type.earthcache,before the missouri river was wrestled into submission in the 20th century it ranged freely between its bluffs across a floodplain as wide as 20 miles carving new channels and abandoning old ones with whimsy fastgrowing deciduous trees willows cottonwoods and elms gathered in groves on the floodplain some surviving a few years others for decades their tenure at the mercy of shifting channels and raging spring floods ngps carboniferous period the pennsylvanian is in the ics geologic timescale the younger of two sub periods or upper of two subsystems of the carboniferous period it lasted from roughly 3232 + 13 to 2989 + 08 ma million years ago the mississippian is a sub period in the geologic timescale or a subsystem of the geologic record it is the earliestlowermost of two sub periods of the carboniferous period lasting from roughly 3589 + 04 to 3232 + 04 million years ago sedimentary sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition of material at the earths surface and within bodies of water sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral andor organic particles detritus to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a solution particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment before being deposited sediment was formed by weathering and erosion in a source area and then transported to the place of deposition by water wind ice mass movement or glaciers stratification stratification refers to the way sediment layers are stacked over each other crossbedding is a feature that occurs at various scales and is observed in conglomerates and sandstones it reflects the transport of gravel and sand by currents that flow over the sediment surface eg in a river channel ripple marks are produced by flowing water or wave action sideview of current rippled sandstone note coin for scale the crossbeds or more accurately crosslaminae are inclined to the right thus the water was flowing from left to right karst topography karst topography is a geological formation shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite subterranean drainage may limit surface water with few to no rivers or lakes many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes being the most common however distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by glacial debris or confined by one or more superimposed nonsoluble rock strata some karst regions include thousands of caves although evidence of caves large enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst how caves form cave formation begins when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it falls through the atmosphere rain water must have carbon dioxide to become acidic it must be acidic to chemically react to the limestone bedrock rainwater is absorbed by the soil into the ground as rainwater comes through the soil it absorbs more carbon dioxide that is being produced by plants that are dead this changes the ground water to a weaker form of carbonic acid h2o + co2 = h2co3 as it travels down through the ground it comes to solid rock when the rock is limestone or dolomite caves can form the water reacts chemically with limestone and slowly a larger and larger space will form this happens because the rocks are made of calcium carbonate caco3 this is what you call chemical erosion as the space becomes larger and larger the water can flow through as it flows it erodes physical erosion washes away rock and sand this is what makes a cave larger and forms an underground stream finally over hundreds of thousands of years or even millions of years the cave is formed sinkhole a sinkhole it is a natural depression in the earths surface caused by erosion water seeps into cracks in the bedrock and erodes away at it over time the cracks get bigger and bigger and soon a cave is formed size of the cave below is not important just know that its down there a sinkhole starts to become visible when the ground starts to sink lower than the surrounding ground sometimes this can happen in an instant and sometimes this can happen slowly over a long period of time logging requirements do not post answers in your log send the following answers to me via email gc4tthm indian cave what part of the carboniferous period was this cave estimated to have been formed how was the cave created sandstone is soft enough to scratch how

GC5CN2T,40.67142,-99.10958,Type.earthcache,introduction the sand and gravel mining industry is very active in nebraska there are 56 sand and gravel mines in nebraska because of safety standards and other policies visiting a sand and gravel mine is highly restricted at this location you have the opportunity to see a sand and gravel mine in operation without being on mining property this earthcache is located on a well maintained county rd in buffalo county the sand and gravel mine overlook is located on kea west rd south of yanney park in kearney ne the natural overlook is a result of an i80 overpass as the road ramps up to go over i80 one has a spectacular view of an active sand and gravel mine you are not on mining property from this overlook you can see a sand and gravel mine in operation you are on public property and no permission is required for you to enjoy this vista and learn about the sand and gravel mining rarely can you get this close to one of these mines and observe the full operation of the mine please park in the nearby public area ne of the coordinates and walk to the overlook location there is considerable truck traffic during the business hours of the mine so it is best not to park on the shoulder of kea west rd there is no sign to indicate this is a mine overlook geology of sand and gravel mining the use of sand and gravel as a commodity falls into two separate categories some is used in construction where it may be mixed with other materials or used as is the second use is industrial where the sand and gravel are used in some way in the production of other materials because so much sand and gravel is consumed in each category the united states geological survey usgs keeps track of sand and gravel consumption in these two separate categories sand whether it is found on beaches or in rivers and streams is mostly quartz silicon dioxide sio2 grains the weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains in the process of weathering the softer weaker minerals in granite such as feldspar are weathered away the more resistant quartz eventually is ground down in size but does not break down chemically in time these quartz grains accumulate in rivers streams deltas and on beaches grains of other weatheringresistant minerals such as garnet rutile ruby sapphire zircon etc are often found in quartz sand as well for some applications it is the silica content quartz of sand that makes it so valuable the silica itself is needed to make products such as glass in addition the physical properties of sand particularly its abrasive property make it useful for traction on icy roadways and railroads and for sandblasting sand and gravel are mined in various waysmostly as open pits along ancient rivers these deposits form as river channels change with the sand and gravel particles left behind in the old bed for example the susquehanna river in upstate new york has several gravel pits as does the platte river valley in nebraska both contain thick gravel deposits left over from rivers that flowed through the areas before the ice ages some 10000 years ago the sand and gravel in these areas are mined in generally the same way first the vegetation and top soil are cleared to form a pit because the water table is so close to the surface near the river the pit fills with water becoming what is called a sandpit lake the pit is then dredged with machines that extract the sand gravel and water the slurry is then sent to a separator that sorts the sand and gravel according to size with each different size used for specific applications the geology of the platte river source of sand and gravel mining the platte river near kearney can trace its evolution through geologic time the central elements are the platte river channels islands and bottomlands which are flanked by terraces that step up away from the river to the north and south significant other elements of the landscape are eolian sand and loess deposits the strata of this land area is made up of gravel sand silt and clay beds from the ground surface to the top of the subsurface tertiary ogallala group or cretaceous formations the sequence consists of pliocene pleistocene and holoceneage strata that document the deposition of a veneer of alluvium by late tertiary and quaternary streams intermixed with and overlain by windblown loess various isopleth and structure maps illustrate the distribution and alluvial architecture of the sedimentary sequence and support the interpretation of former positions of the platte river a regionalscale study consisted of documenting the geologic history of the front range and adjacent mountains and depositional areas east of the mountains in colorado wyoming kansas and nebraska from the end of the cretaceous period about 65 million years ago to the present the structural and sedimentary history of the region is outlined and a series of paleogeographic maps shows the development of the drainage system in the eastcentral rocky mountains and adjacent plains ancestral south platte north platte and laramie rivers are recognized as early as the late eocene although the south platte probably flowed to the southeast from the mountain front at that time deposits of the north platte river are recognized on the west side of the medicine bow mountains of wyoming in the miocene and the presence of distinctive rock clasts indicates that the laramie river flowed from the north park area of colorado northeast across a filled laramie basin and the laramie range of southeastern wyoming in the miocene the present drainage system developed in the late miocene to the pliocene and included the capture and diversion of the south platte river into its present channel the combined north and south platte rivers deposited gravel and sand across nebraska and flowed southeast from kearney nebraska through the middle to late pleistocene within the past 25000 years the platte river below kearney was captured and diverted into its present course and confined there by bounding valley walls of loess requirements for logging 1 observe the mining operation how old is the rock that is mined here where did it come from 2 notice the large body of water where is this water coming from 3 with the help of binoculars or by unaided observation identify the different piles of material that

operations cease please do not post your answers with your log email them to me to verify your completion of the requirements feel free to post a picture of the mine for more information on sand and gravel mining continue reading how sand and gravel mining works sand and gravel mining industry when rocks erode out of the rocky mountains and are carried downstream by streams and rivers they break apart making sand and gravel the sand and gravel settles out of the water and form the river bed as the river channel moves across the landscape the sand and gravel aggregate deposits are left behind in the platte river valley these deposits can be greater than 150 feet deep and often contain mammoth bones and teeth bison bones and petrified wood sand and gravel mining or aggregate mining is an important part of nebraskas economy sand and gravel have a variety of uses including road building construction concrete production landscaping glass manufacturing sand casting in iron and steel foundries snow and ice control petroleum extraction once an aggregate deposit is found the first step in extracting the sand and gravel is to clear the surface of vegetation and topsoil and dig a pit since the water table is so close to the surface in nebraska the pit fills with water and forms a lake a dredge is placed in the lake to extract the aggregate from the pit the material is then carried by running water to a separator which separates the material by particle size different applications require different particle sizes but typically more fine sand is produced than can be sold this excess sand is pumped back to the lake through a discharge or slurry pipe forming the sandy nesting areas used by terns and plovers in areas where most of the natural nesting habitat has been lost on the river eg the central and lower platte rivers sand and gravel mines play an important role in the conservation of terns and plovers after all of the usable aggregate has been extracted from a deposit and the mine is taken out of production the land is sometimes reclaimed as agricultural land but more often the sandpit lakes are developed into lake shore housing developments creating unique

grab this well hidden cache cave gets smaller the deeper you go and has some unexpected changes of direction below are details of the life of the sam bass outlaw sam bass and his hidden caves if you discuss the subject of old west texas outlaws the name of sam bass will undoubtedly pop up like the majority of texans in the 1800s sam bass came to texas from someplace else born in indiana in 1851 sam bass was an orphan when he turned thirteen he spent a few years working at a sawmill in mississippi and then decided to head west to texas texas outlaw sam bass bass made it to texas in 1870 and his first stop was denton about thirty miles north of dallas bass worked there on a nearby ranch and also worked as a freighter but also fell in the wrong crowd in fact by 1877 sam bass was involved in one of the largest train robberies in the history of railroading later in this article is a brief description of the union pacific train robbery that occurred on september 18 1877 at big springs nebraska the sam bass caves in texas sam bass and his gang stole a good deal of money in the period of just a few years and its been said that he hid some of the loot in remote caves in texas if your travels take you to the lone star state you may want to add these interesting sites to your texas trip planner cave entrance near burnet texas burnet county one cave said to be used by sam bass is

christmas daywhen you take one of the guided tours of the fascinating caverns and their colorful and unique structures youll have a chance to see one of the the entrances to a cave reportedly used almost 150 years ago by sam bass and supposdly was used to store some of his plunder be sure to climb the observation tower for a great view of the surrounding texas hill country the observation tower was built in 1935 by the ccc denton county nothing says that an outlaw can have only one cave to hide out in many say that sam bass also hid out in a cave just south of denton texas while the location today is on private land the cave is located in a hill thats easily seen from interstate 35 w the hill is named signal hill and theres also a story that treasure was hid their as well but by this date the site certainly has been thoroughly searched and explored longhorn caverns observation tower grapevine texas there have been many rumors to surface that said sam bass used a cave which today resides near grapevine lake being so long ago nobody knows for certain if this is true or not but the location is in the area that bass was known to hang around grapevine lake is located just northnorthwest of todays dfw international airport between dallas and fort worth a very interesting exploration of the caves location with photos can be seen at website wwwhttpthiseclecticlifecom20140217dentoncavesambass the union pacific train robbery at big springs nebraska the robbery of the union pacific gold train in big springs nebraska was one of the biggest train holdups ever after taking over the train depot and destroying the telegraph sam bass and five companions from texas stopped the union pacific express train which just so happened to be taking a large amount of gold east in fact this particular train was carrying a very large amount of gold coins bass and his gang reportedly took some $60000 in the robbery this kind of stolen loot made sam bass a very wanted man the stolen money was in $20 gold pieces freshly minted at the san francisco mint this was a great deal of money in that era the story of the robbery is that the gang initially found only about $450 but just before leaving they came across the crates of gold pieces the gang was violent they pistol whipped a freight agent on the union pacific train history states that this was and still stands as the largest union pacific robbery to ever occur this type of heist made sam bass one of the great train robbers and very much in the sights of the countrys lawmen whats also amazing is that the big springs nebraska train robbery involving this large amount of loot was the gangs first ever train holdup every lawman after sam bass by the late 1870s bass had not only the texas rangers on his trail but also the pinkerton detectives one of the surest ways for an outlaw to be in the sights of the pinkertons was to rob a train this is what brought the pinkertons to missouri looking for jesse james and his gang in the case of sam bass he was tied in to other train and stagecoach robberies and was wanted by the pinkertons and local law enforcement as well as the governor of texas another one of bass train holdups occurred in allen texas today another far northern suburb of dallas that robbery involved a texas and pacific railroad train in the late 1800s when western local law enforcement might have been shorthanded the pinkertons really functioned as a quasi police force a short career sam bass met his end in round rock texas just a few miles north of austin in 1878 his was not an especially long criminal career bass died at the age of 27 after being gunned down by a lawman in round rock where bass and others had planned to rob the williamson county bank during the shootout in round rock bass shot and killed one deputy and seriously wounded another 1800s structure in old town round rock tx the tale here is that an accomplice of bass cut a deal with the law and helped set up an ambush where sam bass would be taken down the shootout in round rock texas occurred on july 19 1878 it was said that two people were firing rifles at the fleeing gang one a texas ranger as they were attempting to mount their horses for their escape one gang member was killed and bass was mortally wounded sam bass was able to flee the shooting on horseback with another gang member but had to dismount outside of town because of pain they were not immediately pursued the next day a search party found the wounded bass resting against a tree and brought him back to round rock where he died on july 21st this was merely eight years after had originally arrived in texas from mississippi article and photos copyright 2014 western trips some of us may be aware that the early wagon road from dallas to the capital of denton county alton went through copper canyon and west to indian territory mercantile goods went west and buffalo hides went east as the peters colony grew the capital of denton county was moved from old alton to the city of denton copper canyon bandit hideout you may not be aware that on the northern border of copper canyon on hickory creek near pilot knoll there was located one of the most notorious texas bandit hideouts sam bass had other hideouts one at pilot knob near 35w and one up in cooke county on clear creek but when he wanted to visit denton he stayed at his hickory creek location of course back then there was no lake and the swampy bottoms and hilly thickets afforded much cover sam bass born raised moved to denton county sam was born in mitchell indiana on july 21 1851 orphaned at an early age he was forced to live with his aunt and her husband wanting the adventurous life of a cowboy he struck out on his own when he turned 18 he drifted to st louis mo then to rosedale miss while there sam met the mayes family from denton when they asked him in the summer of 1870 if he was interested in returning to denton with them he jumped at the chance to go west sam worked on bob carruths ranch just southwest of copper canyon for a while and then he worked for the lacy hotel in denton located on the northeast corner of town square in the summer of 1871 sam went to work for dad eagan denton sheriff hauling freight this was the last legitimate job sam held sam worked for eagan for four years ending his employment when given a choice to give up his horse racing and gambling or give up the job sam had acquired a very fast mare jenny nick named the denton mare reputed to be out of the famous stallion steeldust back then they ran horses a straight quarter mile and there was none that could beat sams horse dentons track was located where the fair grounds sit today and another local course was at saint jo northwest of denton after an adventure at fort sill racing for some indian ponies sam headed for san antonio in san antonio sam met joel collins joels family ran a ranch where white rock lake is located today joel however was the black sheep of the family joel took time away from his bar tending to run racing scams with sam as their reputation spread so their opportunities diminished joel used his family name to obtain cattle from the local ranchers to drive north heading north to ogallala shoot out in the summer of 1876 sam headed north with a herd of cattle sam and joel sold the herd in ogallala for eight thousand dollars instead of returning to texas to pay the ranchers the two headed for deadwood unfortunately their efforts at mining freighting and bawdyhouse running failed at this point joel and sam enlisting the help of some other desperados began holding up stages in the spring of 1877 the gang robbed the deadwood stage killing the driver in fact folklore has it that calamity jane stopped the runaway stage as it entered deadwood deadwood was becoming a little too hot for the gang and needing money to leave the area the gang planned to rob the up train 100 miles south at ogallala gang robs union pacific on september 19 1877 the collins gang robbed the union pacific train the haul of $60000 in twenty dollar gold pieces and $10000 in money and jewelry from the passengers stands today as the biggest up robbery the gang split up and headed in different directions of the gang of six one escaped to canada two including joel collins were killed while trying to escape arrest one was killed in missouri avoiding arrest and bass and a man named davis made it to denton sam bass robin hood of the west bass became the robin hood of the west through lore and fact he paid the locals in twenty dollar gold pieces for their hospitality and even when taking horses to evade the law he left his spent horses he frequented fort worth where he recorded the purchase of colt 45s and winchester rifles for the sum of $300 dollars also it is documented that he made excursions to san antonio where he spent some time in the company of frank james sam formed a gang from local talent and began raiding trains and stagecoaches by april of 1878 he was the main topic of the legislator in austin major john jones of the texas rangers dispatched a troop of rangers under the command of j peak to dallas to give chase the pinkertons had a strong contingent present sheriff eagan lead posse and judge hogg brother to the famous governor hogg also lead posse in the great chase shoot out at old alton bridge the dallas papers were full of the events of the summer of 1878 sam was referred to as the general and it seems that during the months of may and june he outmaneuvered over two hundred men searching the area around denton and copper canyon in fact one shoot out occurred near where old alton bridge stands today unfortunately for many locals the rangers were not restricted by todays laws of arrest many locals known to befriend bass were rounded up and imprisoned in tyler round rock robbery by the end of june the gang wearied of the relentless chase decided to rob a bank to fund a move to safer territory jackson barnes murphy and bass headed south towards san antonio unknown to bass murphys father had been transported to tyler and murphy had cut a deal with major jones to secure his fathers release as the gang rested in belton murphy sent a telegram to jones warning of the gangs plan to rob the round rock bank on the nineteenth of july the bass gang rode into round rock they were unaware the rangers were already there at about four pm jackson barnes and bass entered a store near the bank to buy some tobacco an over zealous deputy challenged the gang and was killed for his trouble the threegang members ran for their horses barnes was killed instantly and bass was shot in the back jackson helped bass to his horse and they made their escape they only went a little way out of town where jackson patched basss wounds as best he could and then at basss insistence jackson left here lies sam bass the next day bass waved down a passing posse and was transported to a shed near the town hotel despite medical attention bass died from his wounds july 21 1878 on his twentyseventh birthday his grave in round rock cemetery can be visited today although not the original a replica of the stone placed there by his sister stands over his grave it is documented that jackson went on to tombstone he later became a successful rancher and his family sued over the years for a pardon murphy branded a traitor by denton county locals died a horrible death from poisoning about a year later a song written soon after his death and sung at many a campfire over the years immortalized sam bass as late as the 30s parts of the city of denton were being dug up in search of sam bass gold

or more in height at the mouth of this cave where the light and shelter is good i found many of the heads and horns of the wild sheep and the remains of camp fires no doubt those of indian hunters who in stormy weather had camped there and feasted after the fatigues of the chase john muir 1888 steep trails plutos cave plutos cave is a partially collapsed lava tube on the northern outskirts of mount shasta the tube is roughly 190000 years old which is quite old for a lava tube as they normally collapse quickly in geological terms having ceilings only a few metres thick however plutos cave is located in a semiarid climate where erosion is restricted which contributes to its survival the cave was first explored in 1863 by nelson cash who came upon it while looking for stray cattle he named it plutos cave after pluto the greek god of the underworld evidence was found of its use by precolumbian peoples visitors can safely hike into the cave about 1200 feet 350 m formation of a lava tube lava tubes are a type of lava cave formed when an active lowviscosity lava flow develops a continuous and hard crust which thickens and forms a roof above the stillflowing lava stream tubes form in one of two ways by the crusting over of lava channels and from pahoehoe flows where the lava is moving under the surface lava usually leaves the point of eruption in channels these channels tend to stay very hot as their surroundings cool this means they slowly develop walls around them as the surrounding lava cools andor as the channel melts its way deeper these channels can get deep enough to crust over forming an insulating tube that keeps the lava molten and serves as a conduit for the flowing lava these types of lava tubes tend to be closer to the lava eruption point further away from the eruption point lava can flow in an unchanneled fanlike manner as it leaves its source which is usually another lava tube leading back to the eruption point called pahoehoe flows these areas of surfacemoving lava cool forming either a smooth or rough ropy surface the lava continues to flow this way until it begins to block its source at this point the subsurface lava is still hot enough to break out at a point and from this point the lava begins as a new source lava flows from the previous source to this breakout point as the surrounding lava of the pahoehoe flow cools this forms an underground channel that becomes a lava tube whether the tube is formed in a channel close to the eruption site or is formed within a pahoehoe flow when an eruption ceases temporarily halts or changes direction the flowing lava can drain out of the tube forming a lava tube cave plutos cave plutos cave was formed by an eruption of basaltic lava originating from a vent of mount shasta about 8 miles away between deer mountain and the whaleback this lava flow reaches as far as grenada this lava tube is one of the main feeder tubes which carried most of the lava into shasta valley the small domes of lava on the surface in the vicinity of the main entrance to the cave are called schollendomes and were formed when the tube was filled with lava to the point where fluid pressure caused an actual inflation of the flow causing it to rise up bulge outward and form the small domes on the surface plutos cave is unusual in that the diameter of this cave is exceptionally large larger than many of the major caves in the hawaiian islands the large holes in the ceiling of the cave along its length are known as skylights and were formed as the lava cooled and the ceiling of the tube collapsed in places entrance to plutos cave solid as rock fragile as glass caves have special sensitive ecosystems a variety of rare or endangered plants and animals are some of the more significant resources in caves important wildlife and vegetation are found near cave entrances while the interiors are known to support a wide variety of life such as mammals reptiles birds insects and microorganisms recent research suggests caves with their unique and varied strains of microorganisms may offer cure to some of the diseases afflicting humans caves are delicate and must be used wisely to avoid damage unlike the surface environment which in time can heal its wounds a cave once damaged remains that way forever for this reason visitors are encouraged to stay on established trails eat and drink outside of the cave no human waste plan ahead there is a forest service restroom at the waypoint nearest restroom 65 miles as the crow flies from the parking coordinates no fires torches or smoking in the cave treat the cave with respect refrain from vandalism enjoy rocks animals flowers and vegetation but collect only litter camp only in designated areas camping is not permitted at plutos cave it is a day use only area are you prepared always go caving with at least one other person each explorer should carry at least two flashlights cavers often carry a third emergency light source to help answer question 6 one of your flashlights should be at least 200 lumens expect to get a little dirty you will be scrambling over rocks at times and some areas of the cave are pretty dusty wear sturdy nonskid shoes bring warm clothing it can be cool inside of the cave things to know before you go if your gpsr has routing capabilities do not route to the earthcache itself if you do you will be routed via posted private property dirt roads to the cache site this is a big nono you will upset the landowners nearby mightily instead route your gpsr to the parking coordinates provided below

the abundant mineral wealth of the cherokee nation to support a furnace and from 1807 he began promoting his idea of building a furnace in indian country earle wanted a piece of land 6 miles square that had an ore bed and water when he sent men to build a furnace near the confluence of chickamauga creek and the tennessee river they were turned around near taylors crossroads catoosa county the state of tennessee then held up ratification of the treaty giving earle the land and earles plan collapsed jacob stroup jacob stroup raised and commanded a regiment in the war of 1812 in 1815 ironmaking moved to cowpens when edward fewell and jacob stroup built an ironworks lying on both sides of kings creek at dulins old mill stroup and fewell spent $200000 on the purchase which they improved until fewell died in 1822 stroup married fewells wife after his death stroup sometimes misspelled as stroop would soon become wellknown to georgians stroup founded the kings mountain iron company which operated from 1822 to 1830 when a flash flood caused an explosion in the furnace stroup called in his son moses to rebuild the plant while he began working on the cherokee iron works on the broad river in 1826 but he sold the company before 1830 to ernor graham graham renamed the company the south carolina iron manufacturing company while dahlonega and auraria are the best known georgia gold rush towns clarkesville in habersham county and gainesville in hall county also saw significant growth after the 1828 discovery of gold when jacob stroup first set up the stroup iron works in 1831 the town had machine shops four lawyers a confectionery shop two churches three taverns and a brewery by 1835 stroup was having financial problems and interested john c calhoun in investing in his business on the banks of the soque about this time ironmaster jacob stroup brought his son moses into the business as an ironmaker according to ariel sherwoods georgia gazetteer stroups iron works were three miles out of town on the soque river and consisted of a forge and furnace and various workshops to consume that part of the iron which is not sold in bars and castings sherwood gave his production of iron as 25 tons and 60 tons of castings in the year of the panic of 1837 in 1839 the state exempted all employees of stroups iron works in habersham county from serving on jury duty jarvis van buren nephew of martin van buren and founded of habersham countys apple crop joined the stroup iron works as a manager there were many names for the iron works including stroups iron foundry and habersham iron works and manufacturing company moses stroup moses lived in lincoln county north carolina until he joined jacob at the iron works near clarkesville but by the time moses arrived both men were looking west to expand their business in 1837 they journeyed to the new city of cartersville in the former cherokee nation partly to take advantage of the building the western and atlantic railroad and partly because of the rich iron belt associated with the cartersville fault the date of the stroups move to cartersville is based on the sale of the site of the stamp creek furnace from jesse lamberth to alexander stroup son of jacob brother of moses on january 25 1837 alexander conveyed the title to jacob on may 11 1837 jacob and moses establish the first furnace a bloomery on stamp creek that year known as etowah bloomary this forge was replaced in 1841 by etowah bloomary forge no 2 moses stroup ran the etowah works on the stamp river until 1843 when the mill and surrounding land was sold to mark anthony cooper generally known as major cooper who had lost the race for governor earlier in the year at the time the western and atlantic railroad was starting to grade north of the etowah river moses stroup would continue to be involved in georgia production of iron until 1847 mark anthony cooper major cooper was a politician and one of the early organizers of the western and atlantic railroad he purchased stroups etowah bloomary on stamp creek in 1843 and moses stroup continued to work with him to show him how to process iron in 1847 cooper and stroup planned on moving to the etowah river to be closer to the railroad timberland and the iron ore from red top mountain they enlisted a third partner merchant leroy wylie for additional financial backing moses stroup was not able to come up with the money needed so wylie and cooper bought his share the etowah rolling mill was established in 1849 and located just over a mile from coopers allatoona furnace this mill had 9 furnaces with rolling trains nail machines and a hammer all driven by water power in 1856 the plant produced 900 tons of pig iron mostly from 2 open cut mines in the allatoona iron belt along the western and atlantic railroad and other cuts in the wheeler ore bank cooper and wylie established the city of etowah around a blast furnace that still stands today the town had a 175 mile short line railroad to etowah station on the western and atlantic railroad and numerous businesses associated with iron production such as a rolling mill at its height the city of etowah may have had a population of 800 people because of its ability to produce iron the city was a major target during william tecumseh shermans atlanta campaign general jacob cox took the city as temporary commander of the xxiii corps army of the ohio on may26 1864 after a brief battle the city was never rebuilt robert cravenscravens was born in rockingham county virginia and spent most of his childhood in selma alabama and tennessee his uncle george gordon owned the bright hope furnace and let young robert cravens become his partner in 1826 cravens built a furnace on whites creek in rhea county tennessee shortly after becoming gordons partner in 1837 robert cravens moved down whites creek to its confluence with the tennessee river and built eagle furnace which produced highquality iron that was used throughout northwest georgia northeast alabama and southeast tennessee the furnaces at this location were so successful early on that cravens built a canal from the tennessee river to eagle furnace however the panic of 1837 and resulting depression forced robert cravens to close eagle furnace bluff furnace was completed in 1856 owned by the east tennessee iron manufacturing company came online with robert cravens the only principal partner with practical iron experience east of rosss landing the furnace could use both rail and boats to bring in the raw materials to create iron and the furnace flourished until the civil war to overlook his iron empire cravens built the cravens house which figured prominently in the battle of lookout mountain joseph fighting joe hookers men swept across the outcrop craven chose to build his house only to be driven back by a counterattack by edmund pettus the yankees regrouped and took the plateau the changing iron industry in 1869 the bessemer converter was introduce into america and americas iron furnaces concentrated on producing pig iron the form of iron required to make steel most georgia iron was never considered to be high grade with the exception of the dyestone belt as steel production ramped up georgia iron production decreased and by 1875 all furnaces in georgia with the exception of those using dyestone belt iron in extreme northwest had ceased production iron ore continued to be mined in georgia through the early 20th century within a hundred years the bessemer process was considered obsolete types of iron ore ochre soft iron ochre is most commonly used as a coloring agent for masonry products it is the only iron ore currently mined in the county not for iron production but for making pigments by the new riverside ochre company goethite brown iron ore goethite and limonite both popularly called brown iron ore are responsible for most of the pig iron production in the county goethite was named in honor of the german poet and amateur mineral collector johann wolfgang von goeth specularite hematite gray iron ore worldwide hematite in its various forms constitutes the most important source of iron ore it is often reddish in fact its name is from a greek word meaning bloodlike bartow countys hematite is primarily silver gray in color a flaky stone known as specularite although an iron ore little of bartows hematite was used for iron production limonite brown iron ore over the years bartow county has produced some six million tons of brown iron ore the common name for limonite and goethite outside of bartow limonite is found mainly in austria and england slag slag was the waste product of iron production limestone or some other flux was added to the iron ore to draw out the impurities in the furnace the molten iron sank to the bottom while the impurities being lighter rose to the top where they could be scooped out as this waste hardened it formed slag which varies in color and

GC605DA,47.67172,-117.28078,Type.traditional,this cache is part of the 2015 spokane history closed 2016 filmed in spokane open some coins left and 2017 sustainability of spokane closed geocache tours the doctor had the tardis on a mission for the spokane trains and railroads geocoin challenge and now hes back with what he discovered along the way in the form of a fun new puzzle if you are participating in the 2018 spokane trains and railroads geocoin challenge be sure to download and print your star passport find many other helpful resources at spokanegeotourcom and get started today this cache is placed and maintained by lookout lisa the first stop for the doctor and the tardis was not far away as they landed in silverdale washington at the repair warehouse of gtt goblindust telephone and telegraph the year was 1984 goblindust himself was working a regular shift in that time and got the tfs tardis fone system up and running again while goblindust was wondering how a phone built just months ago all of a sudden looked like it was 30 years old the doctor noticed something hanging on a nearby wall of the warehouse it didnt look like it belonged he carefully wrote it down in his notebook 2 with the tfs repaired the tardis started warming up it was time to go ============================== the doctor wondered what mystery he was to solve as the tardis landed on the east side of the same state the doctor knew where he was because he recently visited the very spot but the green line looks much different in 1947 along came a train on the nearby track it was a strange train it was an engine pulling 315 milwaukee road baywindowed rib sider cabooses thats odd the companion said in her cockney accent while pointing at a particular caboose rolling by the doctor agreed all the cabooses before and after were individually numbered with 6 digits but this one had just a single number the doctor carefully wrote it down in his notebook 2 he no sooner was done when the tardis began making that noise theyll soon be on the move ============================== the tardis came to a rest in the year 2041 in the heart of spokane the doctor and the companion stepped out ah yes the doctor thought to himself as he looked up the last time he seen this portal it wasnt completely built yet the ancients of spokane planned well back then the portal was one end of the gateway bridge designed as a bicycle and pedestrian bridge to cross the railroad tracks of the red line real hoverboards and hoverblades reign supreme now days and it has been a good 8 years since a bicycle with tires that contacted the ground that is crossed this bridge underneath a magnatron bullet train zipped by and disappeared in mere seconds arriving in ritzville 4 minutes later the flying bus that was hovering at the gateway bus stop pulled away thus revealing an object that the doctor had seen before at gtt he carefully wrote it down in his notebook 2 with the objective accomplished the tardis took it them to the next location ============================== it was early afternoon whentthe doctor and the companion exited the tardis they were very near the barney and smith company in 1904 dayton ohio why here why now the companion asked i think i know the doctor replied looks like theyre open lets sneak in the offices held the engineering and drafting rooms of a company that builds railroad cars quickly the doctor found the draft table with drawings of the car he suspected number 988 the draftsman was on a break the doctor examined the drawings and noticed what was wrong and thus why they were there the doctor snuck a nervous look around to make sure he wasnt observed grabbed the draftsmans pencil and wrote a note on the drawing contact pullman car company pittsburg he turned on his heel with a lets go to the companion but stopped short causing the companion to bump into him he saw it again this time on a post running to the ceiling he carefully wrote it in his note book 4 ok now lets go he said as they walked back to the tardis the companion asked how did you know about that particular car simple he replied the best breakfast i ever had was in this car on the lilac line in 2020 as soon as they closed the door of the tardis they were off ============================== it was a lovely fall day in 2024 as the doctor and the companion were leaning against the rail of the old milwaukee road trestle high above the spokane river watching the water run by this is a busy place in the 1900s the doctor said to the companion the old black line trains all the time steam coal diesel things change look at it now bicycles strollers joggers brilliant move converting the no longer used track to a trail the doctor turned around and leaned his back against the rail took a deep breath and changing the subject said all we have to do is wait for him who asked the companion that guy he responded pointing with his head a kid on rollerblades a teenager really was approaching from the right and stopped when he reached them i think you are looking for this he said handing the doctor an object thanks the doctor said as he handed it back he took out his note book and carefully wrote down 3 hey check this out said the kid as he clicked the heels of his rollerblades together a magnetic hum sounded and the kid lifted 6 inches up in the air with a how awesome is that smile on his face he turned around and pushed off and started gliding back from where he came the blades never touching the asphalt ah yes the doctor said i thought he looked familiar he invented hoverblades became very wealthy we need to get back to the tardis i have a feeling were heading back to the cache cave station we have all we need to solve the puzzle and now so do you except for the

nonsiliciclastic sandstone and shale are common siliciclastic rocks sedimentary rock limestones are rocks that are composed of mostly calcium carbonate minerals calcite or aragonite carbonate rocks where the dominant carbonate is dolomite calcium magnesium carbonate are named dolomite rock carbonate rocks together make up onefifth of all sedimentary rocks in the stratigraphic record3 varieties of limestone chalk is a marine limestone consisting of tests of microscopic algae and foraminifera tufa is a chemical precipitate of calcium carbonate fossils are very common in marine calcitic sedimentary rocks rocks such as coquina are wholly composed of fossils but socalled normal limestones may be also highly fossiliferous the sample lower left is from the ordovician grainstone is a coarsegrained grainsupported variety that contains almost no limy mud micrite limestone is defined by these two criteria it is a sedimentary rock 1 and it is composed of calcium carbonate 2 there are other rocks that are composed of calcium carbonate carbonatite is a rare type of igneous rock and marble is a common metamorphic rock both are chemically composed of calcium carbonate but they are not limestones because they are not sedimentary rocks limestone can be colored by impurities however iron oxide can make limestone red brown or yellow while carbon can make it gray black or blue how caves are formed the underground world of caves caves are carved by water but water alone could never make the incredible formations found in caves its actually a chemical reaction as plant and animal matter decays in the top level of soil it releases carbon dioxide gas water seeping through reacts with this gas to form weak carbonic acid as carbonic acid dissolves the solid limestone a chemical reaction causes it to dissolve even more limestone about 25 times more than would dissolve in water alone this limestonewater drips through the cavern the carbon dioxide evaporates and the calcium carbonate that is left forms the stalactites and stalagmites we see in caves a cave is formed where there is bedrock of karst or limestone the water carrying on its chemical reactions travel through cracks in the limestone slowly dissolving the rock and enlarging the crevice the runoff descends to the water table the level of whatever river or lake is closest as the acidic water moves to the river or lake it dissolves more limestone widening the underground channel and drawing in more ground water with it in time a main horizontal underground stream is formed with pools and tributaries floyd county is located in the ridge and valley geological region the eastern part of the county is located in the great appalachian valley section of the ridge and valley geological province it contains multiple strata of paleozoic sedimentary rocks deposited when eastern north america was flooded by the ancient iapetus ocean dolomitic limestone limestone sandstone mudstone and shale are the dominant rock formations of the county caves are common in the county when the city of rome was first founded settlers found native american burials carved into the mudstone cliffs along the etowah river all the artifacts and skeletons associated with these burials have disappeared from public view it is not known which native american culture excavated the tombs stalactites softpedia news the carbon dioxide dissolved in the rain water droplets and attacks the limestone rock which is made mostly of calcium carbonate caco3 or calcite as a product of this reaction the newly formed chemical is cahco32 also called calcium hydrogen carbonate an extremely water soluble compound while on the roof of the caves bicarbonate filled water is filtered the carbon dioxide is released and the resulting calcium carbonate precipitates the newly precipitated calcium carbonate starts forming concretions around the falling point of the droplets towards the caves floor a stalactite starts with a tiny ring of calcite deposited by the falling water droplets in time the deposits build a very narrow 05 mm hollow tube called soda straw stalactite which can be very long but easy to break further calcite deposits left by water build the typical coneshaped stalactite this is an extremely slow process as a stalactite requires millions of years to form it is estimated that the growth rhythm of the stalactites is about 25 cm 1 in in 40005000 years the tag caver the earliest recorded description of the cave is from adiel sherwoods 1837 edition of a gazetteer of the state of georgia the gazetteer included an article copied from a rome newspaper dated january 15th 1837 and was signed wkb in the description it says the county presents one and only one natural curiosity that has been discovered and it is a subterranean cave in the lower part of vauns valley about 15 miles from this place rome it is situated on the summit of a lofty eminence and the visitor before he untakes the ascent may refresh himself with a rich draft of pure limestone water which issues from the base of the hill in a stream sufficiently large to supply all the water power necessary for the successful operation of a whole manufacturing village in newengland it has been documented that native americans inhabited the area prior to settlers and they called it talalah which means place of sunshine in the mid 1820s settlers of english scottishirish ancestry came to the area and established it as a town these settlers left the homes of their families in middle georgia the carolinas and virginia to find a place of their own in northwest georgia what they found was an area they would soon come to call cave spring the settlers chose the area because of the abundant water source and its surpassing beauty what they did not know is that the spring flowing out of the cave is fed by an underground aquifer that expels 23 million gallons of water every day the settlers found the area around the cave so delightful they began to build churches schools houses surrounding it they also made the area immediately surrounding the cave into a park for all the people to enjoy its temperature is a constant 57degree coolness very nice on a hot summers day legend has it that cherokee tribal meetings and games used to be held at the site visible in the cave is the towns namesake spring that produces 2 million

where spring exits the earth and remember the whole point of this game is to have fun and explore first we start with hydrogeology hydrogeology that deals with the movement and distribution of groundwater within the rocks of the earths crust such as in aquifers a spring is any natural situation where water flows from an aquifer to the earths surface it is a component of the hydrosphere aquifers in georgia an aquifer is an underground layer of waterbearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials such as gravel clay silt or sand from which groundwater is contained and transmitted groundwater makes up about twenty percent of the earths fresh water supply groundwater is water located beneath the ground surface in voids or fractures of underground layers of rock a unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water the depth at which fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table groundwater is naturally replenished by surface water from streams rivers and precipitation and eventually flows to the surface naturally when it reaches the water table this natural discharge often results in springs springs indians and early settlers were known to depend on the crystal clear waters of cave springs many local folks stop by and fill containers with the water of the spring springs are a small part of the water cycle basically the water of our earth constantly evolves and is moving through a series of changes cave springs is part of that cycle the cycle of water the largest springs like cave springs are formed in limestone and dolomite in the karst topography of the region definition of karst a landscape characterized by the presence of caves springs sinkholes and losing streams created as groundwater dissolves soluble rock such as limestone or dolomite karst cross section limestone fracture relatively easily when weak carbonic acid formed by rainwater and carbon dioxide enters these fractures it dissolves bedrock please note the limestone formation above cave springs with several fractures when it reaches a horizontal crack crevice or a layer of nondissolving rock such as sandstone or shale it begins to cut sideways as the process continues the water hollows out more rock eventually creating airspaces the largest of which are known as caves or caverns this process usually takes thousands of years to complete when the spring surfaces gravity takes over and as with all streams the flow is downhill<<font> spring location spring location is related to geologic structure and topography in the valley and ridge province many springs are located on or near anticlinal anticlinal definition inclining in opposite directions from a central axisaxes and around the noses of plunging anticlines open tension fractures tend to be concentrated in these places and in the case of plunging anticlines wateryielding beds may drain in the direction of plunge the bases of sandstone ridges are in general the sites of major springs cave springs like other larger springs tend to be in valleys and some form the headwaters of streams an example of water flow with a spring formation water flow amount the amount of water that flows from springs depends on many factors including the size of the caverns within the rocks the water pressure in the aquifer the size of the spring basin and the amount of rainfall springs are classified by the volume of the water they discharge the largest springs are called firstmagnitude defined as springs that discharge water at a rate of at least 100 cubic feet of water per second down to eighth magnitude where less than one pint per minute flows zero magnitude is reserved for past sites with no current flow 1st magnitude > 100 cubic feet per second 2nd magnitude 10 100 cubic feet per second 3rd magnitude 1 10 cubic feet per second 4th magnitude 100 gallons per minute 1 cubic feet per second 5th magnitude 10 to 100 gallons per minute 6th magnitude 1 to 10 gallons per minute 7th magnitude 1 pint per minute to gallons per minute 8th magnitude less than 1 pint per minute 0 magnitude no flow sites of pasthistoric flow types of springs springs are named for how they flow and there are four main types the first type of spring is a gravity spring this is just what it sounds like these form from the pull of gravity the water gets pulled down through the ground until it reaches a layer it cant penetrate because it has nowhere else to go it starts flowing horizontally until it reaches an opening and water comes out as a spring these are usually found along hillsides and cliffs next we have artesian springs which come from pressure in confined aquifers forcing the water to the surface the pressure inside the confined aquifer from being smooshed between those impermeable layers is less than the pressure outside the aquifer so the water moves in that direction any cracks or holes in the land will easily let the water escape seepage spring which as you may have guessed is groundwater seeping out at the surface seepage springs slowly let water out through loose soil or rock and are often found in land depressions or low in valleys finally we have a tubular spring these springs occur in underground cave systems which resemble underground highways these tubes or channels are made of limestone and as water moves through this type of rock it dissolves some of it away tubular springs are some of the largest springs on earth and the tubes themselves can be so small that you cant see them or large enough to walk through history note people for millennia have use the spring with its fresh tasty water pouring out of the limestone mountain the creek indians called it home for a long time before the cherokee tribe drove them out then the settlers drifted into the area and drove the cherokee away cave spring ga this earthcache is the entrance to a cave located in rolater park

metasedimentary rocks from the cambrian in the mount morrison region these darkcolored hornfels slates marbles and schists are found in the western foothills notably around coarsegold west of the tehachapi pass and east of the sierra crest the earliest granite of the sierra started to form in the triassic period this granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 372degn in the triassic and into the jurassic an island arc collided with the west coast of north america and raised a chain of volcanoes in an event called the nevadan orogeny nearly all subaerial sierran arc volcanoes have since disappeared their remains were redeposited during the great valley sequence and the subsequent cenozoic filling of the great valley which is the source of much of the sedimentary rock in california in the cretaceous a subduction zone formed at the edge of the continent this means that an oceanic plate started to dive beneath the north american plate magma formed through the subduction of the ancient farallon plate rose in plumes plutons deep underground their combined mass forming what is called the sierra nevada batholith these plutons formed at various times from 115 ma to 87 ma the earlier plutons formed in the western half of the sierra while the later plutons formed in the eastern half of the sierra by 66 ma the protosierra nevada had been worn down to a range of rolling low mountains a few thousand feet high twenty million years ago crustal extension associated with the basin and range province caused extensive volcanism in the sierra about 10 ma the sierra nevada started to form when a block of crust between the coast range and the basin and range province started to tilt to the west as heat from the basin and range extension thinned the eastern part of the block making it more buoyant than the western portion of the block rivers started cutting deep canyons on both sides of the range lava filled some of these canyons which have subsequently eroded leaving table mountains that follow the old river channels about 25 ma the earths climate cooled and ice ages started glaciers carved out characteristic ushaped canyons throughout the sierra the combination of river and glacier erosion exposed the uppermost portions of the plutons emplaced millions of years before leaving only a remnant of metamorphic rock on top of some sierra peaks uplift of the sierra nevada continues today especially along its eastern side this uplift causes large earthquakes such as the lone pine earthquake of 1872 caves in the region humboldttoiyabe national forest caves a hidden world of biological geological and cultural resources the humboldttoiyabe national forest is home to dozens of caves scattered across its 63 million acres many of these caves are known for their recreational opportunities but they are also a rich and often fragile storehouse of extraordinary information the caves on the forest formed millions of years ago and therefore have had a lot of time to accumulate all kinds of amazing things over time they have provided habitat for a variety of species from large mammals to microscopic bacteria many of these caves today are home to endemic species of organisms that in some cases are known nowhere else on earth in the past the forest service has partnered with scientific organizations to conduct various types of research in a number of the forests caves in 1982 the forest partnered with the cave research foundation to fund a project to excavate the fossil remains of a number of large pleistocene age mammals in a cave near ely nevada one fossil removed from the cave was an extinct giant shortfaced bear this species of bear succumbed to extinction about 11000 years ago a cast of the bear resides at the white pine public museum in ely this kind of research is essential to understanding the past so as we head into summer the forest is making a concerted effort to ensure that visitors know best practices for minimizing their impact on the caves there are still many caves that have yet to be fully explored and discoveries waiting to be made their remote locations have ensured they havent been fully explored by the scientific community there are many caves waiting to be discovered as we continue to explore and study caves like the cave used by snowshoe johnson all caves offer protection from the harsh winter in the sierras but until the caves can be explored throughly all visitors need to take care when visiting caves in what has taken hundreds to thousands to millions of years to form can easily be destroyed in a single moment of time the old cavers motto take nothing but pictures kill nothing but time and leave nothing but very carefully placed footprints probably the biggest recreational issue is graffiti and trash so the forest is directing visitors interested in learning more about caving to contact a local chapter or grotto of the national speleological society link is external nss members are available to help teach appropriate caving safety and etiquette the plan also reminds people of the requirements to clean and decontaminate their equipment before and after trips to prevent the spread of white nose syndrome and of course as caves can be home to diverse species and caves may be closed theyre asking visitors to check in with the forest before heading out their front doors this area is full of wonderful hiking trails and amazing geological rock formations formed hundreds of millions of years ago this earthcache is setup to commemorate one of the western sierras heros and his amazing acheivements traversing through all the rugged terrain to deliver the mail the geology of the sierra nevada mountians was considered unpassable by most but thompson

GC83RZA,35.39378,-97.54352,Type.traditional,typically you walk up to gz and know exactly what you are looking for this will not be the case geocaching first coined by matt stum on the gps stash hunt mailing list on may 30 2000 was the joining of two familiar words the prefix geo for earth was used to describe the global nature of the activity but also for its use in familiar topics in gps such as geography caching from the word cache has two different meanings which makes it very appropriate for the activity a french word invented in 1797 the original definition referred to a hiding place someone would use to temporarily store items the word cache stirs up visions of pioneers gold miners and even pirates today the word is still even used in the news to describe hidden weapons locations the second use of cache has more recently been used in technology memory cache is computer storage that is used to quickly retrieve frequently used information your web browser for example stores images on disk so you dont have to retrieve the same image every time you visit similar pages the combination of earth hiding and technology made geocaching an excellent term for the activity however the gps stash hunt was the original and most widely used term until mike teague passed the torch to jeremy irish in september 2000

GC863D5,34.85948,-85.4853,Type.earthcache,there are over 513 known caves in northwest georgia most of them in dade and walker counties you are now in dade county walker is next door these caves are what is known as solution caves formed by underground water dissolving the rock material they are only one feature of what geologists know as karst topography a land surface characterized by bedrock which has been dissolved by chemical weathering rather than worn away by abrasion karst surfaces are commonly marked by sinkholes caves and an absence of surface streams although karst topography may form on any type of soluble rock it is most extensively and intensively developed in limestone a form of calcium carbonate caco3 the solution of limestone is actually a chemical reaction involving the gas carbon dioxide co2 limestone is only sparingly soluble in pure water but when carbon dioxide is added a weak acid carbonic acid is formed this acid attacks the limestone and transforms it into watersoluble products when rainwater percolates through the soil it absorbs carbon dioxide produced by the decay of plant material there is plenty of yearround plant growth here and plenty of rain underground rivers sometimes flow for great distances through caves such as this one and may emerge unexpectedly as waterfalls and surface springs but the ground water in karst is easily and rapidly contaminated having few opportunities to be filtered as it passes through the ground the state of georgia passed the caves protection act of 1977 partly in recognition of issues relating to water supply and groundwater contamination as well as to protect the irreplaceable fragile delicacy of the caves themselves most limestone is not porous but is cut by numerous cracks called joints water seeps through these cracks reaches a waterfilled zone known as the water table then moves horizontally along other cracks gradually widening them into larger and larger conduits that eventually form caves as we will see the dissolvingaway limestone can undercut other rock layers causing them to fall the limestones here are very old hard and dense knox dolostone and chickamauga limestone water sometimes flows long distances down through these strata creating in nearby walker county some of the deepest known pits in north america when water seeping from a joint enters a cave room it creates speleothems including stalactites stalagmites and curtains these phenomenon will only be found in interior rooms of a cave collapse is an integral part of cave development as you will soon see here in many caves including this one the floor is piled high with breakdown blocks of collapsed material from the ceiling and walls caves are also wellknown as natural air conditioners and some enterprising settlers in cave country drilled into caves beneath their homes to tap into the alwayscool air currents flowing naturally through them today many organizations work to protect the caves in this area and the watersheds above them the southeastern cave conservancy inc is the largest land conservancy solely dedicated to the protection of caves and karst environments the national speleological society promotes the exploration study and protection of caves citation an introduction to caves and cave exploring in georgia by dr barry f beck georgia southwestern college americus 1980 the posted coordinates will take you to the upper entrance your journey in completing this earthcache will take you safely near but not into both of the two entrances to sittons cave in cloudland canyon state park it is very important that you follow this course as stated and do not deviate from it nor permit your children to do so important both cloudland canyon state park policy and georgia state law the caves protection act of 1977 prohibits entry without permission and a guide for information about guided tours inquire at the park main visitor center although the distance to be hiked is relatively short the use of a hiking stick and sturdy shoes with good traction is recommended your journey begins at the sittons gulch parking area see parking coordinates where you will be obliged to pay a $5perday parking fee in the dropboxes provided if you have not already done so today unless you have an annual pass provided by the friends of georgia state parks the trail begins close to the entrance gate directly opposite the first set of signs that you will pass on the way in step one walk along this trail until you come to the lower entrance waypoint the lower cave entrance is at the bottom of the cliff in front of you because the rocks here are exceptionally slippery even in dry weather stay on the trail where your footing is sure from this position what natural phenomenon informs you that a cave entrance is nearby what distinctive characteristic of this phenomenon informs you that this cave has another much larger entrance elsewhere what temperature is this phenomenon and why do you think so the lower cave entrance is at the base of the ledge in front of you is the color of the rocks on the ledge above the entrance area mostly the same or noticeably different from the color of the fallen rocks surrounding the entrance the lower entrance which was probably formed by water is modest and unassuming but the natural phenomenon aforementioned immediately informs you that the cave must have more than one entrance the interior temperature of a cave is always moreorless 58of which means that air entering another higher entrance will naturally cool down then descend then be exhausted out of some other hole the cave will not breathe but will exhaust air night and day also if the upper entrance is larger the air flow will always be strong step two turn to your right and proceed toward the cache final coordinates the upper entrance this will be a steep ascent of a few hundred feet with few handholds do not let your children run ahead of you when you arrive at the final coordinates you will still be standing on the trail safely behind a row of waisthigh boulders stay where you are safely on the trail and keep your children close at hand as you take it all in this is the second largest cave entrance in the state of georgia its quite the sight to see the upper cave entrance is a prime example of a process of upward collapse known as stoping which can create entrances from underground chambers that did not originally form as entrances as one layer of rock collapses it exposes the next layer above it to the pull of gravity eventually this layer cracks and weakens and the process continues until a hard layer of rock is encountered or the surface is breached the process narrows upward since the edges are supported by the underlying layer and thus tend to remain in place evidence of stoping includes blocks of stone which fell from the roof they may be of noticeably different stone than the floor on which they now lie the edges of the blocks remain rough unlike surfaces carved by flowing water stoping exposes passages which were originally formed by other means and which may contain features such as flowstone or stalagtites which are found only in underground passages formed by water what color is the rock layer above the mouth of this cave entrance what color are the rock walls within the opening what color are the rocks piled on the bottom floor below how does this tell you that stoping has occurred what do you see on the wall of the cave opposite from where you now stand look to the right how does this tell you that this was once an interior room of the cave do you feel a cool wind coming out of this entrance to the cave why or why not return very carefully the way you came please send us your answers via email or groundspeak message to cache owner do not post answers in your found log or write note on the cache page photos of you near the cave are welcome as long as they do not include spoilers to any of

written by frank borror east peoria historical society president beneath much of illinois lies a black treasure coal illinois coal deposits began to form more than 300 million years ago during the pennsylvanian period when the land that is now illinois was near the equator east peoria geophysically lies in what is called the illinois basin and that basin contains a tremendous quantity of bituminous coal enough to make the state of illinois the possessor of more bituminous coal than any other state the first recorded discovery of coal in north america was in illinois in 1673 that is when two french explorers marquette and joliet first saw coal along the banks of the illinois river beneath much of illinois lies a black treasure coal illinois coal deposits began to form more than 300 million years ago during the pennsylvanian period when the land that is now illinois was near the equator east peoria geophysically lies in what is called the illinois basin and that basin contains a tremendous quantity of bituminous coal enough to make the state of illinois the possessor of more bituminous coal than any other state the first recorded discovery of coal in north america was in illinois in 1673 that is when two french explorers marquette and joliet first saw coal along the banks of the illinois river early settlers began burrowing into coal deposits near the surface and by the late 1800s coal mining had become east peorias first industry it is known that james whittaker mined coal near wesley city as early as 1852 in 1900 there were seven major coal companies operating in east peoria employing 250 men with a production of some 2000 tons of coal per day all of the coal mined in this area was used for local consumption mining companies at that time were lake erie coal and mining company east peoria coal company standard coal company doering coal company giebelhausen coal company manhattan coal company and royster coal company the largest coal mine in east peoria was the lake erie mine situated on wesley road just off what now is north main street the lake earie was what is called an underground slope mine meaning it did not have a vertical shaft but rather burrowed into the side of the hill and sloped downward to a coal vein in this case it was the springfield coal vein at a depth of 265 feet the area mined covered over one and a half square miles and stretched a far east as springfield road with air shafts located at several points it employed some 50 men and produced 300 tons of coal per day its wesley coal so named because of its proximity to wesley city was highly prized for its purity the seam of coal that was mined was four and one third feet thick requiring miners worked in underground corridors less than five feet high the coal was transferred to the surface by mine carts or trolleys pulled with stream powered cables mules were not used as in other east peoria mines this mine was a pick mine which meant there was no machinery used to extract the coal just picks to break apart the coal after black powder charges had been detonated to fracture the coal face the mine began operations in 1899 as the progressive mine under the auspices of the progressive coal company which reopened and extended a mine that had closed ten years earlier this earlier mine was operated at a depth of 100 feet from 1878 to 1889 by brothers christian and joseph rusche as the rusche coal company and later as the wesley city coal mine mules were employed to tow trolleys and it is reported to have even used st bernard dogs for the same purpose when first established the ten year gap in operations causes the bureau of mines to consider wesley city and lake erie as two separate mines it was operated during most of its existence as lake erie coal and mining company from 1902 to 1905 1906 to 1908 1910 to 1917 and 1919 to 1939 the mine was operated as carters coal mine in 1905 and 1906 by carters coal mining company directed by frederick r carter carters coal mine under the supervision of john appleby provided coal for the adjacent carter and kanne brickyards carter had purchased the spurck brick company which would evolve into peoria brick and tile david h cummings managed the mine from 1907 until 1910 in tandem with his brother ambrose d cumming who owned standard coal mine also located in east peoria the mine was known as maplewood coal mine 1 from 1917 to 1919 lake erie mine closed in february of 1939 and by 1940 there were no coal mines operating in the east peoria area most of the coal that was easily assessable had been mined and underground mining had become more expensive than stripmining with the advent of massive mining machinery frank giacolette was a typical lake erie coal miner who scratched out a living for his wife and two children ray and delores franks daughter delores meischner relates that her father dropped out of school to work in the mines when he was nine years old and franks son ray a former city of east peoria inspector says his dads father was working at the cherry mine at the time of the 1909 cherry mine disaster two hundred and fiftynine men and boys died in that mine fire although not injured in the cherry mine accident giacolette later lost a leg in another mine incident coal mining was a very dangerous occupation and four miners lost their lives during the lake erie mines forty years of operation frank kinnamon on april 22 1918 frank giebelhausen on june 11 1918 charles h butterfield on july 17 1934 and vincent arriotto on september 31 1937 frank

GCHF0G,33.30753,-86.85533,Type.traditional,mine all mine one of the toughest and most hazardous jobs in the world is that of a miner the central alabama birmingham metro area was literally built by the steel industry this steel was produced from iron ore and coal mined throughout the area the earliest mining took place in the days before the civil war during the civil war coal was mined to fuel the blast furnaces at tannehill brierfield selma and oxmoor now the site of an industrial park with only a historic plaque remaining to mark this historic location these furnaces produced iron that was used by the confederacy to armor war ships and to produce weaponry such as cannons and as ammunition for these cannons the iron was also used to produce rails for steam locomotives to transport goods to confederate troops the rails laid by confederate forces often led to mining operations where coal and iron ore were mined by slaves and indentured servants it was no simple task to create a railroad system there were no modern tools such as gps and topographical maps to help plan the route to the mines it was backbreaking work to create rail beds trees had to be cut passes through mountains had to be blasted with nitroglycerin and the rubble from the blasting operation had to be removed by hand if the route to a mine encountered a waterway bridges had to be built the bridges that crossed these waterways were marvels of engineering at the time they were built they were constructed of stone that had to be quarried and transported to the site these stones which could weigh thousands of pounds had to be meticulously shaped and fitted to other stones to create pillars and abutments by locating this geocache you will visit one of these historic locations that is known only to a handful of people the site of the geocache is the ruins of a bridge that once led to the gould mine near helena the gould mine was started by uncle billy gould early in the days of the civil war uncle billy acquired 1700 acres of coal land near helena on this land uncle billy sank a shaft onehundred and thirtyfive deep during the highpoint of mining from this shaft workers brought out seventyfive tons of coal a day all of which was shipped to the confederate arsenal and naval foundry at selma things went well for uncle billy gould as he mined coal throughout the civil war until the waning days of the war in april of 1865 days before general robert e lee surrendered at appomattox the union general wilson and his raiders began a march towards the confederate rolling mill located in helena while enroute to the rolling mill wilsons raiders systematically razed everything in their path unfortunately uncle billys coal mine stood between the rolling mill and wilsons raiders after crossing the bridge leading to the mine wilsons raiders burned the bridge and then proceeded to burn threethousand tons of uncle billys coal that was due to be shipped via rail to the naval foundry in selma later that same day wilsons raiders reached helena and proceed to raze the rolling mill in helena it is now 2004 almost 140 years since wilsons raiders put an end to uncle billys coal mine but there are still artifacts to be visited most notably the remains of the bridge that was razed the remaining stone work is a testament to the craftsmanship of these early masons and stoneworkers these masons built something that still stands today even though it is hidden from public view and is well worth a visit here are some pictures of the remains of the bridge that was razed and what you will see when visiting the area where the geocache is located you can click the thumbnail images to see a fullsize picture when visiting the area its easy to imagine the sounds and smells of steam powered locomotives as they crossed this now extinct bridge as you listen to the peaceful sounds of the water as it flows through the area as you explore the area think of the miners engineers and laborers that toiled to create a transportation route for the coal from the mine try to imagine what life must have been like in the area 140 yearsago this may sound crazy but as i visited the area today i closed my eyes and could hear the sounds of steam operated machinery the sounds of the nowdefunct railway and the sounds of workers speaking amongst themselves visiting the area really is like taking a step back in time i think it is so cool to be able to see the old rail bed that is still visible even though many trees now lay in its path even though the cache container is prettymuch run of the mill its a 30 caliber ammo can reaching the cache is not the typical geocache experience and i consider it to be part of the adventure as a geocacher you will have to determine the best way to access the geocache you should take some time to study maps this cache is literally located in the middle of nowhere but visiting the area and seeing the artifacts created by our ancestors will make the effort worthwhile this is not a driveby geocache and you need to be prepared to spend some time researching the best way to reach the cache site while hiking to the cache site i had to cross several small streams and work my way through many very thick briar patches i have the bloody scars to prove it you should also be aware that the area where the cache is hidden as well as the areas near it are often used for hunting if visiting the area during hunting season make sure to wear plenty of bright colored clothes as well as a orange hunters safety vest as no geocache is worth getting accidentally shot i am an admitted civil war fanatic and admittedly attempt to learn as much about my hometown area as i can as such i have to give credit where credit is due i originally discovered this very historic site while on a hike with my brother readymixer and his boss keith we actually discovered the bridge abutment on the opposite side of the water from where the geocache is located even though i did not yet know the history of the area i knew that i had to place a geocache in the area in an attempt to allow others to learn the history of the area it took many hours of research to learn the history of the area i would also like to credit mr henry emfinger owner and curator of the aldrich coal mine museum inc for information regarding this historic site the aldrich museum is

GCX4MQ,34.30205,-116.83112,Type.traditional,it is belived that gold was first discovered in bear valley in 1855 this is when reports first began to surface of gold discoveries near bear lake today called baldwin lake big bear lake would not exist for another 30 years the gold rush of 1849 was fresh ineveryones mind and california was ready for another rush the only passage to the valley was a long and very difficult indian trail up the santa ana canyon and down into the valley originally only placer gold was discovered this is gold that is found in streams these streams would freeze over in the winter and start up again in spring a few hardy miners that stayed through the winter of 1859 named their camp starvation flat the area was soon flooded with prospectors adventurers speculators merchants gamblers and all the others typically drawn to a boom by 1873 bear valley and the surrounding areas had been well searched and staked out finding a new and profitable claim was becoming difficult at best two hardluck miners brothers charley and barney carter were were looking for exactly that when they discovered gold on the ridge of a mountain just east of holcomb valley in july of 1873 they filed four claims on this ridge two of were called the rainbow and moonlight mines in december of that year they sold these on what was now called carters mountain claims to elias lucky baldwin a multimillionare who made his fortune in nevada silver mining initial surveyor reports had stated that the goldquartz ore ran two miles across the mountain from west to east ranging in width from 50 to 100 feet and as high as 85 feet one local paper reported that the crown of the mountain is a mass of gold bearing rock baldwin was pouring money in the mine on now what was called gold mountain by the end of 1874 he had 150 miners working the claims the ore they mined was being stockpiled for processing in the stamp mill he was building see 1875 stamp mill cache a 5mile flume was constructed by chinese laborers to supply water for the mill see flume tunnel cache chinese laborers were also cutting roads from the mine northeast to cactus flat forest road 3n61and west to holcomb valley forest road 3n16 a road was also constructed that ran down to bairdstown see doble cache it all came together in march of 1875 the mine was being worked by 180 miners the roads were open and the 40stamp mill started operation the boom lasted 2 months the quality of the ore was nowhere near expectations and 20 of the forty stamps at the mill were shut down in may by november of 1875 the mine and mill had ceased operations the mill was used to process ore from other mines in the summer of 1876 and then closed the mine remained idle for the next 17 years in 1893 budd doble baldwins soninlaw invested $25000 of his own money to start up the mine the quality of the ore remained low and the mine was closed again in 1895 in 1899 captain j r lamar tried his luck at the mine he belived that he could recover a profitable amount of gold from the ore using a new technolgy this was to use cyanide to dissolve the gold in the ore and recover it from the cyanide he constructed a new 40stamp mill since the original mill had burned to the ground in 1878 see 1900 stamp mill cache his run lasted until 1903 from then on series of people tried to make a profit from the mine the final attempt was just after world war ii this time a ball mill was set up just below the mine the remains of the timbers which supported the hopper that fed ore to the mill are still there though it appears that it will colaspe at any moment the ball mill was removed in 1952 the mine never made much of a profit for the people who invested in it except maybe for the carters who sold their claims to baldwin for $30000 to get there take hwy 18 to the north side of baldwin lake and turn north onto holcom valley road just before you get to the gate of the refuse tranfer station you will see where the unpaved section of holcomb valley road 3n16begins off to your right note there is a service road that goes off to the right just before holcomb valley road an abandonded mine can be found behind a berm holcomb valley road is passable in higher clearance vehicles i went up in a subcompact once but it was slow going in a couple of places if you want to explore the area below the road look for an old access road it turns off holcomb valley road about 100150 east of the mine this photo taken in 1922 shows the glory hole in the foreground and the 1900 stamp mill on the left what is there today that you do not see in the photo are the timbers that supported an ore hopper that was not added until 1947 elias lucky baldwin by the time his mine was opened elias lucky baldwins interests were
