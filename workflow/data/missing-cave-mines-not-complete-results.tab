ElectroQTed	Found it	7/1/2007	There were people about in the park and the neighbouring back yards, but I felt I was able to duck into the bushes without being seen. Then, just as I was signing the logbook, a kid comes rushing in looking for cover (they were playing hide & seek) and caught me red-handed. He apologized (huh?) and took off and then the next one came by. I felt a little awkward, being a 40-something male, alone, exiting a small bush where several kids were playing. Your camo job on the cache was very nicely done though. Thanks. Ted.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC12K71_woodland-twins
Friendly Goat	Found it	6/30/2007	Nice hide, had me stumped for a while but then jumped right out. Second time looking for me (before as "fullerrc") so the find was doubly exciting. Some muggles nearby smoking up, but they probably didn't care that I was there. Maybe they thought I was the pizza guy & wondered why I was delivering to the bushes.

Friendly Goat	Didn't find it	6/18/2007	Looked & looked. Found the "twins," zeroed out a few times but nothing.

MikeyCarter	Temporarily Disable Listing	7/13/2007	I've temporarily disabled this cache until the cache can be put back. Thank you for noticing. Maybe I should re-think the hide if it was seen as garbage	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC12X5W_yellowstone-cave
carolmcclellan	Found it	7/13/2007	DO NOT LOOK FOR THIS CACHE!! My husband and I were out for a hike in the conservation area about a week ago and thinking the cache was some garbage, my husband picked it up and put it in his pocket to dispose of later. We didn't realize what it was until he gave it to me in the car on the way home... being a geographer, heavily into gis, gps and anything to do with mapping, i knew what it was as soon as i cracked it open.. not to mention i was a little upset, because i knew it was going to spoil it for whomever planted the cache! anyhow, it reminded me to check out geo-caching, which is a good thing ... we will hopefully be back in that area again so we can replant it for you guys and i will let everyone know when it is ready to be hunted again.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC12X5W_yellowstone-cave
Amazon Annie	Didn't find it	7/12/2007	Took a friend caching for the first time and I knew this area so I thought it would be fun. $8.50 later in park fees (I forgot my BT card in my other pack) and we came up empty. Enjoyed the walk around the area but we searched high and low, cracked the hint and still no luck. It's been quite a while since the cache has been found - hopefully someone else will come up better luck than we did. Thanks for the visit! By the way, with entrance fee you can also visit Terra Cotta Conservation Area, Island Lake Conservation Area as well as the Belfountain one on the same ticket as long as it's all in one day!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC12X5W_yellowstone-cave
Buttons.	Found it	5/30/2007	I have never been in here before. Very nice little park. We ended up doing the hole loop and cross the neat bridge. We also go surveyed on our way out. Thanks for the cache. Buttons and Beaux.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC12X5W_yellowstone-cave
Nozzletime	Found it	5/30/2007	I have been in this park previously. We did the loop around the lake. I knew where the cache was going to be before we even got in the park. Nice to come back. We wound up being asked to do a survey, by the Credit Valley Conservation Area. Had a nice talk with one of the groundskeepers and the questionnaire gal. Thanks Nozzletime & Smudge	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC12X5W_yellowstone-cave

Rideau Rangers	Found it	5/27/2007	Narrowed down the area and then sent Ranger 4 to make the find. Glad it was quiet today. We also used our Bruce Trail card to get in, but were told that if we intended to picnic, we would have to pay, but if we were just passing through it was okay.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC12X5W_yellowstone-cave
ElectroQTed	Found it	5/20/2007	We've been in Belfountain before, around the time of my 100th cache in 2004. It was nice to return. We drove into the conservation area, and I flashed by Bruce Trail membership card at the gate to get in for free - membership has its privileges! We walked to the cave and had a look around. I was mistaking the entrance to the cave for what was described in the hint. I do hope this one stands the test of time, as there were kids climbing all over the insides. We finished off by crossing the suspension bridge and doing the short loop back to the parking area. Thanks for the cache. Laurie & Ted.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC12X5W_yellowstone-cave

Soon realized we were at the Cave - good we wanted this one too. I was starting to get a bit frustrated, not much time before we had to pick up my daughter from Guides camp down the road, then I heard Radar say those magic words - Found It!

bruce iroquoia	Found it	7/19/2011	Dropped our daughter off at the airport and continued on to find another old cache. I was after one of my Ontario Bingo Challenge GCRKRJ caches in the area and picked this additional cache up.. My wife came and enjoyed staying around the car as my backup. Parked at the southern dead end road. A great hike to find all 3 caches in this area of the Bruce Trail. The cache was dry and in good condition. Take plenty of water in the summer. TN,LN,SL TFTC Had a special visitor on the trail. A PORCUPINE was looking my way and slowly walked down the trail and then up a tree as I passed by.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave

geocite	Found it	4/7/2011	We continued down the trail to grab this one too before heading to the Millcroft Inn for the evening. Sorry Dan, we looked around but couldn't see your lens cap. On the plus side, we did find the cache without too much trouble which is surprising because it usually takes us forever to find rock hides. After signing in, we enjoyed our hike back to the car. It took us just under an hour to find this one and The Dingle. Thanks for the exercise!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
Swifteroo	Found it	3/22/2011	Nice quick find. Seems that this one is not affected by snow anymore (if it was most recently). lost my "Nikon" lens cap somewhere between here and the dingle. if anyone finds it, I'd love to know! :) Thanks for the hide.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
rebel10	Write note	3/20/2011	That was us hiking back from the dingle. We will be back to get this one. Spinner, chewie , rebel10. Nice trail.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
t4e	Found it	3/20/2011	we were convinced that the cache must be frozen in its "cave" so were ready to walk away luckily i decided to check out another spot that looked like it could accommodate a cache and there it was tftc	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
dfx	Found it	3/20/2011	Wow, we almost called it quits on that one. Reading through the past logs we figured there's a good chance the cache might still be under snow or even enclosed in ice. Determination paid off though and t4e had the lucky hand. While we were searching, two hikers came down the trail and greeted us with "is there one there too?" Turns out they just came from the dingle cache further down the trail, nice to meet you They didn't want to join is in on the search though, quite understandably really TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
sderraugh	Didn't find it	3/12/2011	Nope, no luck today. As I approached the cache I thought, "Rock pile? What rock pile?" It was completely buried in snow! I searched around a bit, brushing the snow off the one or two rocks that were actually visible but I figured it was futile. I'll have to try it one day after the snow melts.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
greywynd	Found it	2/12/2011	Barely had the shovel out and going when Brook22 said she'd found this one. Good thing too, generally I hate rock caches, even more so when they are buried in the snow! TFTC!! Greywynd	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
Brook22	Found it	2/12/2011	Even though the Dingle was our target cache in the area, finding this one was just as satisfying! tftc	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
geob.o.b.	Found it	2/12/2011	Found with emzernask, brook22 and greywynd. Carried on walking from the Dingle to see if we would have a little more luck locating the cache. Fortunately with a little help from greywynd's shovel and persistence from all of us, brook22 said the magic words and had the cache in hand! I think we left a great geotrail for the next cachers - if it doesn't snow! SL TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
emzernask	Found it	2/12/2011	barely had a chance to start searching when the call 'found it' came from brook22. fun winter hike with brook22, greywynd and geo.b.o.b. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
GPS Derek	Didn't find it	2/5/2011	Here with BBoG and Entogeek targeting the Dingle, this being just down the trail (yes there is a trail under that snow). Arrive and see what the hint describes but it does not indicate the 12+ inches of snow on top. Well with too much digging we give up till spring at which point we will likely walk up and go "found it" within seconds!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
entogeek	Didn't find it	2/5/2011	Despite a good effort by GPS Derek, BBoG and the geek, there was just a wee bit too much snow to find the cache. C'est la vie, eh? Wasn't expecting to find it given Mother Nature's snowy embrace so will be back again in the spring for another hike along the trail.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
hikerT	Found it	10/30/2010	After finding Dr. House's 5000th cache at The Dingle, we continued on a short way to this one. I expected a longer search from the look of things when we arrived but I found it in the first place I looked. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
Dr. House	Found it	10/30/2010	Since this one was so close and hikerT still needed to find it, we made the short trek from The Dingle to get it off the screen. This was actually a quicker find than I figured it would be (which is why I'd bypassed it on my other excursions through the area), with T finding it very shortly after arriving. TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
chris-mouse	Found it	10/15/2010	Avernar needed to find The Dingle for a challenge cache, so after finding that, we wandered a bit further up the trail to find this cache. Lots of deer around. We saw one cross the trail in front of us on the way in, and could hear them moving in the trees all around us on the way out.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave

Hedgehog in the Fog	Found it	10/11/2010	#73 - Great hiding spot! I wish the container was a little bigger, there is plenty of room in the cave: I had a bear TB with me that traveled from England and it would have been a great dry cache for her to spend some time in but she would not fit! Instead, dropped off another TB, Cambridge Blue - a little key chain. Dropped off my handmade coin and a little token, took Fab5 sig item and looked at the logs - no user with similar name visited the cache. I wonder who dropped it off?

For this one we walked together with ElectroQTed and Laurie and luckily they had the coordinates because for some reason I didn't have it in my GPS. We got there and worked on the rock pile together and found it pretty quickly. 8 eyes are better than 4 :) On the way back to the trailhead we had a nice conversation with ElectroQTed.

Juicepig	Found it	6/10/2007	Well it looks like your cave has collapsed, as all that is left here is a pile of rocks. I almost gave up 3 times, but kept on trucking. Location doesn't really match the clue either..	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave
GordEtob	Found it	6/9/2007	I didn't mention yesterday that this cache was REALLY a hexed location. I noticed a big "7" shaped gash on the glass display of my new GPS unit! I must have clunked it against one of the rocks!! So, I've got a grudge against this cache, and wanted to conquer it. I brought in Eagle Eyes for extra search power, and after about 20 minutes, Eagle Eyes spotted the nasty hide. I was complaining that it didn't match the spot if you interpret the clue literally, but he thought you could say that it's acceptable. Well, he found it, so I guess it's all good in the end.

GordEtob	Didn't find it	6/8/2007	I came up from "Fallen Hand" to try this one, even though I hadn't brought my caching notes. I was just going by the co-ordinates that I downloaded on the GPS. As I got to ground zero, the batteries were giving out. I searched obvious spots and came up with nothing (except a shredded rain poncho! Those spiky trees are nasty!). I thought that one particular "cave" was most promising, but I think when I was poking a stick in there I knocked something too deep in to be retrieved. I hope it wasn't the cache! I'll have to get back to this one. And wouldn't you know it -- it's the farthest cache from the road!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13770_the-cave

ELJohnBoi	Found it	4/29/2015	Been avoiding this one for some time due to the somewhat rough trail - especially now as muddy conditions and some ice hanging on made trekking a bit rough. Finding the cave = easy, finding the cache much harder thanks to a minor glacier built up within the cave - smaller person would have less trouble for now,. Should be easier with a bit more melting.

regan99	Found it	5/12/2009	TFTC OK I read the hints and logs and now understand why I didn't find it. Got the location. Beautiful hike along an easy trail. At first GPS was sporatic, and it put me off several metres. Realized the batteries were dying, and after changing, GPS put me right on the cave. Could not find the cache even with the hint, but now realize why. The Cave still has several feet of ice in it, so I believe this is were the cache is. Hope it was crush proof!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16D9Q_the-cave
geocite	Found it	10/11/2008	We really enjoyed the walk to this one, on this beautiful fall day. The cache took us a while to locate, though -- quite a few possible hiding spots, and the clue didn't seem to match anything we could see. In fact, we almost gave up and came away with a DNF, but one of us just idly looked in the right spot in a last ditch effort as we were heading out, and there it was.

Bryan00009	Found it	10/4/2007	Okay, I've walked the trail around the lake many times so I knew almost where the cache was without even using the GPS. This one is not hard to walk to if you approach from the north end of the lake. One could easily get there and back in less than an hour. I ran the geocaching difficulty/terrain test and it came out as 2/3.25, so you may want to adjust that. Honestly, the exact spot is not so great. I lost GPS reception several times in the area and so couldn't get an estimate how accurate the coordinates were. Also, because of the tree covering and western exposure, this one is likely to be cold and damp and/or covered in snow for much of the year. The rocks will be slick or icy so it won't be any fun climbing in there. The edge of those rocks are sharp, so one needs to be careful at any time. I would prefer to see a sunnier location. The cache was not difficult to find. In fact, I moved it in a little further -- if it's called a cave, I think one should have to get inside. I signed the log, took nothing, and left a (used) 1859 Canada Beaver postage stamp. Don't anyone get excited, -- it cost 99 cents on eBay. Thanks.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16D9Q_the-cave

ElectroQTed	Needs Maintenance	10/25/2009	This cache needs to be put back where the owner originally intended it to be - it's currently not even in the cave. It also needs a new ziplock bag for the logbook - the original one is now on the outside of the lock-n-leak container. Most importantly, a decent set of co-ordinates is needed as they have been about 26m out from the start.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave

hikerboy	Found it	8/3/2009	This was my second try at this one after a no-find last fall. At first I had no luck... of course that's because I was looking in pretty much the same places I did on my first go-round. Eventually, common sense took over and I got to thinking that i was making this cave find more "difficult" than "easy" and so I followed my hunch a little more closely than the GPS and made the find.

Galloping Gourmet	Found it	7/1/2009	my second cave in a few weeks. This one was much easier than the other one I did. found on a 7 k round trip on the Bruce with geodog LUTZ . Got most of the caches in the area and only spent a few hours here. lots of muggles around on Canada day. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Rideau Rangers	Found it	6/8/2009	So near and yet quite a climb to the cache area from the lower parking. Glad the rocks were not too wet this evening. Thanks!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
AlHBurlingtonOnt	Found it	6/8/2009	I knew the cache was there, but waited until the ice and snow had gone so it was much easier to get to. :) TFTC PS It is rather wet and damp having been buried in ice for a few months.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave

hikerT	Found it	5/29/2009	The snow is all gone... FINALLY so I was able to come back to grab this one today. This cave was a piece of cake compared to the cave caches I did last weekend up in Collingwood. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
rtyrie	Found it	5/24/2009	We parked at Mount Nemo for this one and found it while doing the south loop trail. The cache was a bit past the loop, so kept going along the BT. This cache was our goal for the hike as I knew it would be something the kids would like. I got to GZ and didn't see the cave, but saw a group of people further down the trail looking down into something. They left just as we arrived, and sure enough it was the crevice. I recognized it from Avernar's photos so I knew we were in the right spot. Climbed down, followed by my son, and then carried my daughter down. It was a warm day today, but it was cold enough in the crevice for our breath to condense. Found the cache, took some photos, and then climbed back out. As expected the kids enjoyed this cache. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
SensVsLeafs	Found it	5/23/2009	Loved this one, Leaf didn't want to come down, but luckily I am a tad more adventurous and made the plunge and had the cache shortly after. Favorite of the day. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Avernar	Found it	5/17/2009	15:43 Came back and the cache is out of it's icy tomb! Spent an hour doing some flash photography in the crevice/cave. TFTC. [This entry was edited by Avernar on Sunday, May 17, 2009 at 7:03:53 PM.]	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Brook22	Found it	5/12/2009	We did find the container - with the help of Nozzletime. It is still encased in ice, but he managed to uncover the lid for a pic. He didn't want to chip away at it any more in case he damaged the container, so we weren't able to sign the logbook. tftc	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Avernar	Didn't find it	5/11/2009	19:42 Search the cave/crevice twice and all I found were beer cans and some charred logs. I emailed the previous finder and he said they found "a cache" down the trail and down the ladder that didn't match this cache description. From the sounds of it they may have locked onto "Cooper Trail Number 2" by accident. There's still a little ice down there. It may still be buried or it's missing. No smiley for me, just a geo stripe.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
ELJohnBoi	Didn't find it	5/7/2009	GPS coords way off on this one. We actually found another nearby cache and thought it was this one until advised by a cacher that we may have found another cache - which turned out to be the case. We did check out the crevasse/cave - still ice but with 2 sets of eyes, nothing there. May be under the ice or missing. Will re-check when in Burlington again. Thanks Avenar	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave

rovers3	Didn't find it	4/18/2009	I joined NorMin & Ruffy in the cave to try to unearth, or should I say unice the cache but it is still too thick. Will need to return with large pick or wait about a month to get this one. rovers3	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
NorMin & Ruffy	Write note	4/18/2009	Hiking this section of the Bruce Trail today with the End To End crew, which today included hikerT, rovers3 (including Avey), Zoeker Bill, Nozzletime & Smudge and us. One was a previous finder who knew where the cache should be, but there is still a thick layer of ice down there, and no luck for us finding it. It may be another month before it thaws out enough. The coords seemed to be out quite a bit. Would suggest that the cache be relocated slightly to make it more accessible year-round.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
hikerT	Didn't find it	4/18/2009	Out hiking today with NorMin & Ruffy, Zoeker Bill, rovers3 and Nozzletime and Smudge. (wow our crowd is growing) Nozz was giving instructions as to where it was but the ice is still too thick and we couldn't even spot it. Coords are at least 35m out.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Tri_Again	Write note	4/15/2009	I think we should start a club consisting of cachers that have attempted this cache only to find frozen in ice. We could call ourselves the Freezy Cavers!!!!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
The_Eh_theist	Didn't find it	4/14/2009	Easy Cave my butt!! I must've took the most difficult way in....and then all the ice and snow. I thought it would have melted, but it's still pretty thick... I'll be back in July!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
emzernask	Didn't find it	4/4/2009	not so easy cave as there was at least 5' of snow left hiding the cache. This entry was edited by emzernask on Tuesday, 21 June 2011 at 01:42:52 UTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
res2100	Didn't find it	4/4/2009	Add the 3 of us to the list of DNFs. We gave this one a decent try and are sure we had the right cave\crevice as it matched the hint\description exactly and even spotted both possible hiding spots based on the hint, however there is still snow and ice down in the cave and everything on the cave floor is frozen in place. Guess we'll have to come back at some point again to try and find it. Took pictures as proof that we were in the right spot which I will post. Also I agree with others, the coords are off quite a bit.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave

Geodog45	Didn't find it	3/20/2009	Think we were in the right subterranean passage, but need to wait until Spring has been here for more than just a few hours to thaw the ice.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
cam-moe	Didn't find it	3/15/2009	Out with DexnDad and had to give up on this one, but happy to get back and read from the logs that we are not alone and also not at fault... Winter just keeps getting me down! Think we may have seen GlennaPaul exploring this cave when we arrived as they really seemed to be "looking" for something... we poked around a little where the gps was actually pointing us and then went back to this crevice when the area cleared. Great hike up, with a bit of challenge getting back down with the kids in tow (3, 5, 6) Lots of muddy clothes to clean but oh well, it's only cache ($$)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
DexnDad	Didn't find it	3/15/2009	Just like everyone else we hiked thru the muck hoping for this one. We had to wait our turn as there seemed to be a lot of people hanging around this cave today. We'll have to go back in the summer I guess.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Glennask	Didn't find it	3/15/2009	We had a frustrating day but are confident with clear heads we'll be able to find this one! We're still learning :)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Tri_Again	Write note	3/14/2009	We were hoping with the warmer weather and sunlight lately that this cache might be ready to be found again....unfortunately we forgot that caves don't get a lot of sunlight. When we got to GZ we found a lot of snow and ice piled up. It may still be a few weeks before this cache is ready for a cacher. We enjoyed the hike!! I'll be back to try again.

Brook22	Didn't find it	2/10/2009	Met up with AlHBurlingtonOnt on the trails and he decided to join us on our hike. Went down into the cave but came up empty. Nozz figured that the container is encased in about 6 inches of ice right now. Will be back in the spring	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
ElectroQTed	Didn't find it	12/27/2008	I found the right crevice by using the description by others that the co-ords were out by about 26m. I could get down OK, but there is about 3 feet of snow right at the cache site by the logs. The logs were barely visible with all the snow - only the tops that were sticking out gave the area away. I hunted around a bit, but there's just too much snow in there right now. It was a bit of a disappointment to come away empty after the effort required to get up there, especially with all the ice and slush on the way up.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
GeoMistrz	Found it	12/14/2008	Last one of the day while in the area. Great little cave to go into without it being too hard. TFTC TNLNSL.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
MulderX	Found it	12/7/2008	Well, same as others, It took me over an hour of rooting through crevices and caves at various distances from GZ before I finally practically fell into location. Once I found the right location I had the cache in hand in about 30 seconds. Not sure if the coordinates are on purpose or not, but a better set for some people might be N43 25.003 W079 52.012, which put me about 26M south of GZ. Use these at your discretion as the escarpment can play with your GPS badly. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
foam follower	Found it	12/2/2008	3 of 5 today...at first this was very frustrating as my gps was saying GZ was a little furthur away than it actually was...and there was some potential at the fake GZ...but then after reading the logs and expanding the search, it all made sense...TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
KryptonianFletch	Found it	11/22/2008	Very tricky hike the winter ... very much in the "going bacl down part"... Bruce Trail officials have a sign up saying the trail is closed, but we encountered many others also out for an afternoon hike, so the lack-of-respect-for-rules thing was widespread. Had to go into "the cave" twice as we missed it the first time. Very, very dry (good container!). Great Hide. Thanx.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
world 67	Didn't find it	11/7/2008	I feel the pain of Hikerboy- left the ladies at the top and went for an extensive search- I'm sure i was close but with all the fall leaves, the clue seemed to be at every turn.

hikerboy	Didn't find it	11/4/2008	Good thing it was an incredible early November day cuz this one was frustrating... the cache description, hint, and to some extent the GPS, seemed to be pointing to the same thing but no luck. There are a lot of leaves and detrius on the floor of the crevice cave. If I was looking in the right place, I gave it 45 minutes before giving up. Or, then again, maybe I was just in the wrong place.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
cammanron	Found it	11/3/2008	Nice trek along here... been here before, but not on top... As Zoeker Bill stated, the co-ords seemed off quite a bit, but since we knew what this cache was, some logical spots were checked. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Captain_Jim	Found it	11/2/2008	Found on a busy day at the cache site. passed a lot of people going down as I went up. But all clear so i hit the cave and found the cache. made a quick swap then back on my way. Hmmm who did I pass?	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Zoeker Bill	Found it	11/2/2008	A perfect Autumn day for a trek up onto the Bruce. We weren't the only people enjoying the fall weather, as a matter of fact it was quite the popular area today. Found the cache with cammanron and Monica after a bit of a search. We also found the coordinates to be off quite a bit, but once we were in the area we spotted the cave and eventually the cache. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1HJVH_easy-cave
Big&LittleZee	Found it	11/2/2008	We had a nice energetic hike to the cache site from the bottom and found the cave even though for us the coordinates seemed to be out a fair bit. The cache was spotted fairly quickly but there were no trading items in it so we TN but left 4 items. Pretty brisk walking along the ridge but some great views!

2 GYPSIES WITH NO MOSS BETWEEN OUR TOES	Found it	9/16/2014	Another day of great caching while camping/caching the Yarmouth area. We spent most of the day today looking for urban caches and a few outside the city limits. Lots of good caches of all sizes and degrees of difficulty. We signed some logs with our full name and the smaller ones as 2 Gypsies. Left our calling card in a few of the larger containers. Many thanks to the cache owners for placing these caches for all to enjoy.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1PAY2_abandoned-silica-mine-

GeoMistrz	Found it	5/14/2009	I searched for 20 minutes, gave up and went to the other cache near by. Once finding that one, I decided to give this one another shot. On the way back I checked my GPS and compared the coordinates to the webpage on my phone and realized that I had the old coordinates loaded. Used the new coordinates and as luck would have it I found the cache in 5 minutes. Definitely a tough hide, as micros in the woods usually are, TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Cool_easy_cache	Found it	5/13/2009	Pretty quick find, all things considered. I forgot my PDA at home, so all I had to go on were the names! I had no clue about the size or anything about this one. My GPSr was a bit jumpy, but based on the name, I only looked in certain spots. Good hide! Oh, and once again I started out on the wrong side of the creek. But this time, no handy bridge - but some handy big rocks! TFTC! #404	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Rideau Rangers	Found it	5/9/2009	Thank you for a great hide. We thought the GPS was bouncy, but if we had trusted it we would have been faster. Very satisfying find to end the day!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller

dakotaa99	Found it	4/30/2009	A quick find.....too quick actually, it was laying out in the open. Signed the log and rehid in the spot I think it was supposed to be. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Team Goju	Found it	4/28/2009	This one was the tougher of the two caches along this creek, both to get access to, and to find. The creek was raging and there was no chance of a little rock hopping across, so the walk was a bit longer and it took some time to find the right cave. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Dreadnaught	Found it	4/26/2009	Crystal and I searched for about 20 minutes before we were joined by Advisorgee and MulderX. (Nice to meet you both). The search continued for about another 10 minutes before we were joined by the Mississauga Misfits. Then the search continued some more. After another 10 minutes Mr. Misfit came up with the find. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Mississauga Misfits	Found it	4/26/2009	A bit of a toughie for sure. We first had to get the right path and the right spot to cross the creek. As we approached, we saw Dreadnaught and Crystal Dawns looking for the cache and we knew we were in trouble. As well there was Advisorgee and MulderX (nice to finally meet you guys). After some discussion on which set of coords to use (I guess they've changed a couple of times), we joined in the hunt. Lots of places to look. After about 15 minutes, Mr MM spotted it. Nicely done. We found the coords to be off a bit but not too much - I've posted them here. TFTC and the impromtu geo-event.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
asemper	Found it	4/26/2009	Nice hide, I went around in many circles looking for this little guy. I finally found the right cave and signed the log! TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
advisorgee	Found it	4/26/2009	We were trying to decide which path to take, and we noticed a couple of people on the other path; one of them said to the other "Do you have a flashlight". So we knew we were on the wrong path. We met Crystal Dawns and Dreadnaught. We were soon joined by the Mississauga Misfits. It took a bit more searching, but the cache was eventually found.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
MulderX	Found it	4/26/2009	This was definitely a team effort with Advisorgee, Dreadnaugh, Crystal Dawn and eventually the Misfits showing up. The prize went to Mr. Mississauga Misfits being the eventual finder, but wow was this tough. In the end I think the first set of coordinates were probably better than the new ones, but it does bounces a lot so I am sure day by day it changes quite a bit. Anyway, glad to have this one off my list. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
prastost	Found it	4/25/2009	This was a difficult one to nab - I advise future cachers to use the new coords + old coords as a radius to begin searching if they are unable to locate quickly. I was going to give up as the sky darkened, but it was found eventually. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Roaming Ryans	Update Coordinates	4/25/2009	** Coordinates Changed From ** N 43° 35.815 W 079° 37.724 Distance From Old: 62.3 feet I revisited the cache today and used the waypoint averaging feature on my new Garmin eTrex Venture HC to get a better set of coordinates. Thanks to HMarkguy for bringing this feature to my attention.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
jtannahi	Found it	4/25/2009	Spent about 20 minutes looking before I found it - tough to locate! GPS was bouncing all over the place which probably accounts for all of the different co-ords in the logs. (First likely place I looked was home to garter snake - but cache was not there). SL. Many thanks	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Crystal Dawns	Found it	4/24/2009	Found with Dreadnaught. Met up with AdvisorGee, MulderX, and then came the Mississauga Misfits. We searched for quite a while, Then came two more and we searched for a while. Then along came 2 more and we searched for a bit again. Finally Kieran came up with the find. With all the different cords Gordetob's were the closest. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
sderraugh	Found it	4/23/2009	Even with the new co-ords it took me a while. At first my GPS pointed me to a very likely spot, with lots of footprints and what looked like "camo" around it. So I scoured that area for a few minutes but ... no cache. Finally found it eventually.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Roaming Ryans	Owner Maintenance	4/23/2009	I've updated the cache coordinates... thanks HMarkguy. I used a Magellan Sportrax when I placed this cache and later realized that it was way off the mark when I tried to find other caches in the area. The Magellan has been put to rest and I'm now using a Garmin eTrex Venture HC (excellent new device!). I have 5 more caches that I'm hoping to create over the next week or so... I'll try to do a better job with the coordinates on the new caches!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Radiofly	Didn't find it	4/22/2009	2:30PM - We searched and searched however we had no luck. The GPS kept zeroing out in a muddy hole but nothing there. We finally ran out of time and had to leave we will return another day. Radiofly and SweetGirl	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
GordEtob	Found it	4/22/2009	A very tough find! After I found it, I saw in the logbook that others had found it today and wondered if they had as much trouble as I did. (I'm sort of glad that they did!) I centred out in a very muddy area that had looked very well searched. If you find yourself ankle deep in mud -- you're in the wrong spot!! After 15 minutes, I decided it was time to check out the clue and the narrative rather than just rely on co-ordinates and the cache title. Well, that eliminated a lot of possibilities. I eventually spread out my search area farther and farther. After about 45 minutes, I finally saw something that looked a pinch artificial...and there was the cache! WHEW! I was surprised that it was 16 metres off the mark. I took my own reading and saw that my own GPS was wandering quite a bit. It finally did come out pretty close to HMarkguy's co-ordinates, so if only I had used those, I would have had an easier time of it. Oh well.

Big&LittleZee	Found it	4/22/2009	I tried this one yesterday while doing the other new ones in the area but too no avail after searching for 20 min. or so and I had to return to work. Today as I parked at the cache I saw someone walk down the trail towards it and when I got close I saw Buttons already searching and thought that today would be a quick stop and go. After 15 min. of searching and trying some different coordinates along comes HikerT to join in the fun. We expanded our search area and were all searching and re-checking spots when I spotted something a little bit suspicious and there was the cache. All I can say is that I was the lucky one and Avenar's coordinates put me closest to the cache but were not perfect as all our GPS's were jumping around quite a bit. Not quite where I was expecting it to be either! A nasty hide. SL TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
hikerT	Found it	4/22/2009	I was trying to route to the cache across the road and ended up finding parking for this cache(actually both). As I crossed the water I saw Buttons searching for the cache, then Big Z quite a ways a way searching as well. We all searched and searched some more. Just as I got a bit of a soaker Big Z found the cache. Definately not where I expected it to be. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
Buttons.	Found it	4/22/2009	Very very tough find. Started to look the I had the pleasure of being joined by Big Z. The 2 of us looked for a bit and then along came more help. Hiker T joined us. With all these eyes we are bound to find it. After consulting the hint and previous logs we noticed another set of cords. Punched them in and searched even more. Finally way up there Big Z finds it. Nasty hide. Thanks for the cache. Buttons and Beaux.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller

Avernar	Found it	4/21/2009	17:59 Crossed the creek just after the rain stopped so the rocks were a little slippery. Made my way over an after a bit of searching I found it. TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
geob.o.b.	Found it	4/21/2009	Somewhere along the trail the GPS wanted me to go - you guessed it - right across the water. Decided to walk up to another main road, cross over the water, and come back from a different direction. Walked pass another walker going the opposite direction, but as I approached the cache, this same fella was already there. Well darn it! Great meeting you JackFamily, and thanks alot for the helping hand across the boulders. Saved many a meter with the return short cut. SL TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller
JackFamily	Found it	4/21/2009	Had trouble zeroing out with all the cover so I just followed the hint and my nose. After re-hiding I met geob.o.b. also on the hunt for this cache. Shattered my mental image of geob.o.b. being someone named Bob! Nice to meet you. We walked back down to Mississauga Valley CC together and she gave me a tip about a cache I DNFed yesterday and the best path to take to the Cooksville Guardian. Thanks. Thanks for attaching the string to the logbook, extraction was super easy. I have a few of these containers waiting to become caches so it was good to see how one performs in the field. Log was dry as a bone. TFTC! #372	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1Q844_wooden-cave-dweller

HoLLeTT>	Found it	6/1/2019	In town today for the car show at the airport and then started to visited caches in the area. I saw this one was a little farther away and wasn't sure what to expect when the pavement ended and the rest of the way was going to be a gravel road... The road turned out to be quite decent and it wasn't long before I saw the turnoff and ATV trail to the cache. It was a short walk to the cemetery and then the contained was located after a brief search and a walk downhill to look at the stream. It's enjoyable to get a glimpse into the history of an area by visiting sites such as this one. Thanks for bringing me here today and thanks for the cache. I looked at the next cache ("Enjoy the view") and started along the road, but quickly came to a bridge and decided that this was far enough in my car. That cache will have to be for another day!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1RJGQ_coal-mine-grave-yard
WiFi902	Found it	4/29/2019	As I am logging this I noticed the D/T rating and it is definitely lower than it should be. This geocache was my longest hunt of the day. With all of the small evergreens on the other side of the chain fence I was looking for a long time before I decided to walk to the bottom of the river where I finally found it about 10 feet away from the river. I grabbed a couple cable ties and I hung it up on a small evergreen like the hint indicated. First find in over two years. SL with red sharpie.

I am not sure where the "entrance" to the cache area was, but I am guessing the route we took was not the recommended one. We traversed a stream, then climbed a 50 foot embankment to get to this one, but no trouble finding it. I have seen more old graveyards in the past couple of months than I have in my lifetime.

CacheDrone	Post Reviewer Note	11/21/2009	Hi there! I've noticed that your cache has been disabled for a really long time. More than 2 months actually. That is much more than the few weeks in the guidelines http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint so it's time for me to take some kind of action. I wish I didn't have to but many others are probably hoping to find out what's going on with your cache. You have lots of choices so pick the one that applies from this handy list. } Repair and/or Replace your cache and whatever else is needed, post an Owner Maintenance log and then ENABLE your cache. Sit back and wait for the praises. } If you don't plan on fixing it up then please Archive it so someone else can have the spot and to remove it from searches. Remove any remnants of your previously enjoyed cache too. } If you really hope to get it fixed but there is some unusual reason why you can't do it soon then at least post a Note so that everyone knows you are on top of it. You might wonder what happens if you don't pick one of those. Well, if nothing happens then after one month from today it is likely that I will Archive it for you. Honestly, I'd rather you decide so please do something before then. Please don't send me an email but instead follow the instructions posted above.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1WA9R_allys-cave

Should you decide to perform the required maintenance, you will need to "[green]ENABLE[/green]" this listing after repairs are completed and you may also need to use an "[green]Owner Maintenance[/green]" log type to clear any remaining Needs Maintenance attribute icons. Please have this geocache enabled again within a short time or archive the listing. I may check back after a month and archive if no action/response has happened.

Three Girls & A Guy	Found it	4/15/2012	Went back and found the 2nd cache on a beautiful, warm and sunny evening. This time we didn't hike around nearly as much. LOL Thanks for the fun! Left Veterans pin.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2GEPB_new-lairg-mine-multi
Three Girls & A Guy	Needs Maintenance	4/15/2012	First WP needs maintenance. Log destroyed and someone had nicely moved the cache to a safe niche in the side cliff face. Found, noted second WP and replaced under the shattered log. Should be moved for safety as it looks like an animal (bear?) moved the log. On that note, one should approach these locations cautiously and noisely - BF is a hunter and picked up bear sign outside shaft entrances. Thought we knew where this one was located and ended up doing a lot more tough hiking than necessary. Found the open shaft first, didn't realize it was the location of the second WP...sigh...hiked back again. For some reason the second hint did not print and we did not find the second cache. Will go back today, find the log and sign.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2GEPB_new-lairg-mine-multi

The Marathon Man	Found it	11/13/2010	Out for the day to find some caches that I haven't found yet and to help CachingWithBeagles set out a few caches. Out with CachingWithBeagles, pnutbeagle and The Monster Beagles for the find. We found the first stage easily and then went for the final. After climbing the hill and back down a couple of time, we finally located the entrance. We then went into the entrance and could not see a thing. My eye finally adjusted enough so I could see the interior better before I got too wet from the dripping roof, estimated where the cache container would be and it was found. Nice multi. This reminds me of a cache in Southern Ontario which was an even more difficult adventure than this one GC1X7FQ - Mining Some Cold Hard Cache Too #4142	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2GEPB_new-lairg-mine-multi
Khoas	Found it	10/20/2010	Wow, neat spot, of course I probably picked the most difficult approach to the final and found I had nothing to sign the log book with when I got there. Will post pictures later to prove the find. TNLN TFTH	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2GEPB_new-lairg-mine-multi

Navig8her	Found it	10/17/2010	Headed out to this one on a damp morning with OFAS saying it's rated at a 3/3 so for a Pushkin cache that equals a difficulty of 6. Parked and found first coordinates very easily so then I imagined the next phase to be impossible! Off we headed up the hill. Found the "spot" but then we didn't have the right equipment so OFAS headed back to the car and arrived with the equipment required and we found the cache easily-Mind you I stayed a few meters back in case we encountered the inhabitants that make homes in these kinds of places . No encounters with residents so signed log and said out loud that was too easy for a Pushkin multi. So TFTH and a FTF.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2GEPB_new-lairg-mine-multi

juniorwoodchuckhuey	Found it	8/25/2019	As usual with caches hidden by this CO, I had an enjoyable outing. I drove a short way in on the road that comes from the NE. When the road got overgrown near a quarry, I parked and walked about 1km to the ATV trail. The trail was pretty good (if you're walking). Coordinates were right on and the cache is in good condition. Thank you for bringing me here!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine
WiFi902	Write note	8/28/2017	In reference to the log from 4ceasons, I didn't mean to imply I had walked down into the mine. I walked through some tall grass to get to the geocache. The tall grass was covering up a depression in the ground that I stepped into. I wasn't expecting the drop and didn't feel overly safe for whatever reason. Well, it's because there are mines around. I was hasty in signing the log and retreated quickly to the trail. I was by myself and it was one of those moments where my feet werent visible and I was unsure of the surroundings. The whole time the mine was visible and I was clear of it. Great spot, enjoyed it very much. Cheers, WiFi902. :D	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine

I wonder what lift was like here almost 120 years ago. The cache is in great shape, thanks for marking the area.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine
4CeasonS	Found it	8/13/2017	We found WiFi's log to be misleading. There is NO NEED to go down into the mine hole. The cache is above the rim and follows the hint. While the men went into the depths of the hold, the women and children looked around outside and found the cache out there. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine
hirtle	Found it	8/13/2017	Made a smiley here today while out with JaJaKeIz (and Dog-Lion) and 4CeasonS for some caching fun. We had quite the adventure here, enjoying the scenery and the interesting history of this location. Oh, there's the trail. LOL. This one took us a few minutes to find as we were exploring the pit/mine. Leona made the find while the rest of us looked elsewhere. Dog-Lion walked away with the best prize . TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine
WiFi902	Found it	5/25/2017	The mines here are under water and it was difficult to see the shaft openings. The pic from Rellevartns was impressive. While signing this one you are down in a low depression. I hoped that the ground wouldn't let go below me and fortunately it didn't. I'm sure the spot that I stood in was safe but it felt precarious. After signing the log on this one I made my way to some other points of interest before heading back to the truck. I really enjoyed my trip here and I am uploading a couple of pics. TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine
WiFi902	Write note	5/25/2017	Posting a pic for Rellevartns to answer the question about the mystery item in the woods. It's a bus. Pic uploaded. I followed the trail for a bit but saw no buildings or remnants. I saw household items in two dump piles near the bus back on the main trail.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine
Rellevartns	Found it	4/30/2017	After spending some time looking at the 60’ deep non-flooded Tennycape Manganese Mining Company Western Shaft https://gesner.novascotia.ca/amosearch/singlereport.aspx?ShaftID=TEN-1-002 we picked up the ATV trail shown in the attached Abandoned Mines map and took it eastward towards the cache, only losing it a few times in the heavy overgrowth and downed trees. Saw a big tadpole swimming in the first flooded open cut we encountered on the way to GZ and were very pleased to find super clear water and a great angle of the sun at the second flooded open cut which is the Tennycape Manganese Mining Company Open Cut No.1 https://gesner.novascotia.ca/amosearch/singlereport.aspx?ShaftID=TEN-1-006 So cool to see the spooky mineshaft opening below the water (see photo). Made our way through the juniper bush overgrowth to GZ and saw the flooded shaft nearby, but it was shaded from the sun and not as impressive as the pond. Cached was found with bang on coords and in great shape. Signed log. Completely forgot about checking out an item of interest on the satellite at N 45 15.221 W 063 53.659 that we suspect might be one of the collapsed buildings shown in the Abandoned Mines Nova Scotia video. Dang. We spent most of our hike back to the car talking about the history of the murder, and trying to envision life in East Hants at the turn of the 20th century. A favourite point heading your way once I earn another one to use. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine

taylorstransfer	Found it	12/21/2016	Out with Riverbugs on the first day of winter caching in the rain. Two of the easiest Pushkin's we've done. The hardest part was making it up the icy, rutted road. Made the short hike here from Peddlers Tunnel and made the quick find again as cords and hint were bang on. For some reason Riverbugs didn't want to explore this one either. Interesting area. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine
kevywevs	Write note	8/16/2016	For those who may be interested, we have produced a video of the Peddlar's Tunnel / Tennycape Mine area, complete with underground explore of Peddlar's Tunnel (so you don't have to). We'll show you the ponded open cuts still found at the old site, with the spooky flooded shafts that go down into the earth. Peddlar's Tunnel is nearly plugged, but we managed to squeeze our smallest explorer into the abandoned mine to shoot the underground video. Mine Map shown in the video, along with the GPS co-ordinates in the final credits, if you need them. ADDED FEATURE: There is a 6-storey deep inclined shaft about 300-400 feet north (atop the hill) from Peddlar's Tunnel. Completely open, and not flooded. Lots of orange flagging tape there. BE CAREFUL - do NOT try to go into it without proper rope/rigging ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tViP2om3u1c	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine

Falach-fead	Found it	10/14/2012	Found the mine today with Tulach Ard and Slickmoe84. Included track log image that shows our bushwack into Peddler's Tunnel from the road and then up to waypoint A which is at the trail that leads all the way to the cache. The trail was over grown in one location and we headed north and ended up trekking around several very large sink holes and two that held very clear ponds, even saw some small fish in one of them. Much easier to stay on the trail as we found out on the way back but we would have missed the scenic ponds. Slickmoe84 found the cache right on at the GZ. Another awesome caching and hiking adventure, TFTH.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine

Love to go exploring, new roads to travel, new pot holes to hit. Thanks for the Hunt. Signed Log For Credit. Only two DNF's along the way. Find 55 of 57 on the day. Had to quit early, shame, could have had a better day. What did they mine here ? Was it barite ? Was a much easier find, wonder why ? Some very interesting hole/shaft, many water filled.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine
kjackinhfx	Found it	5/22/2011	I say found it, as I found the site, not the cache; however, after climbing the hill on foot from the cemetary on Highway #215 in and bushwhacking around in a circle through swampy terrain it was getting late and bloody so checked this one off, as I am not sure if I will rush back in the near future. I have some friends in the area so I will check out the history, etc. more first. P.S. As with Peddler's Tunnel, highly recommend leaving the main dirt road by the brook / swamp and hiking in on the side towards Walton. Trust me.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine
Beaver Pelt	Found it	5/19/2011	In the area today doing the Walton Rd seris and saw these ones on my gps... Since I always enjoy your locals,I was eager to look for this one.. Another great spot to discover. Took a little searching but found it after about 10 mins... Coords were bang on as was the description.. Txs for the fun and history lesson. By the way.. That hole looks really deep.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2W0NG_tennecape-mine

taylorstransfer	Write note	5/11/2016	Back in the area today with Riverbugs so decided to replace this one as old cache was cracked and quite foul smelling. Replaced with same container as original and rehid in the same spot. Left replacement log as original log is still quite wet. Should be good to go for next cacher.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2WVXE_slack-brook-mine

taylorstransfer	Found it	4/28/2016	Quick find with Riverbugs(almost a park and grab).Parked 190m from cache and had a nice walk through moss covered forest to mine adit. Cache was right where hint said it was. Unfortunately it had a tough winter with a large hole and crack in the lid. Cache was 3/4 full with some very stagnant water. Cleaned out and repaired as best we could. Left new container and log in cache as well as original log. Would have loved to explore tunnel but not sure if I'd fit. The video of inside is awesome. Thanks once again for bringing us to a very cool spot.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2WVXE_slack-brook-mine

taylorstransfer	Found it	8/19/2017	Found with Riverbugs. An easy to get to Pushkin and great views from Oceanside Rd. When we arrived at GZ found a very recognizable container hanging outside the entrance. Not sure why. We then entered the cave and easily found the real cache. Replaced log. TFTC Finally over 3 months later(as this is how long it took one of the 5 cachers on the replacement cache to log their visit here) we know why we found 2 caches here. If the goal was to keep people from entering the cave then why was the original cache not removed? We found it, fixed it up and replaced as per hint. Also at least 5 other cachers came here between the time the replacement was left and the visit was logged all who may have entered the cave. It is unfortunate that the replacement is a pill bottle hanging in a tree( it could have been better suited to reflect the CO's style of hides and is very likely to be muggled) as part of the joy of a Pushkin besides the amazing locales is actually finding the cache. Anyone who knows the frustration of searching for a Pushkin cache also knows the sense of accomplishment of finding one. This lessens that experience greatly.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC332RD_georgeville-mine
Beaver Pelt	Found it	8/3/2017	Enjoying a nice early morning cache run with the guys. This trip included Talonnfenton as we were heading to Cape Breton after doing some caching. This was a quick easy find. We sent TNF in for the cache where we retrieved the container. Cache was filled with water and everything was wet. We returned the cache to its local and left a small cache outside the entrance. The reason we did this was because DNR asks people not to enter caves in NS to help stop the spread of white nose disease that effects bats. We ask all cachers respect this policy and avoid entering caves. We will help PK by removing caches to the outside entrances. We hope all cachers can respect this and help the bat population thrive. As always, another great spot. Txs	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC332RD_georgeville-mine
Plasma Boy	Found it	9/2/2015	Donned all of geology gear and headed for this cache. GPSr was bouncing everywhere, but finally found it. Cache was where advertised.

Sunburnz	Found it	8/21/2015	Found with Valley Dwellers, beautiful walk in along the brook, minus the wasp's nest. Mrs. Valley Dweller was the brave one in the group to crawl in & throw the cache out for us to sign. TFTC !	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC332RD_georgeville-mine
Valley Dwellers	Found it	8/21/2015	Now this was an interesting cache! Walked up the brook with Mr. Sunburnz leading the way - and thank goodness he was as he was first to discover the wasps' nest. Four stings later and he's still leading the hiking party. Somehow there was a switch made at the entrance to the mine and Mrs. Dweller was at the front when it was time to enter the mine. Cache was found where the hint indicates and Mrs D threw it out to the others to sign - not wanting to make two trips. Managed to bypass the wasps on the way back.

Pi Elves	Found it	8/6/2013	We were ready for an adventure and we were not disappointed! Fun bushwhack in, decided to walk the river back. Glad I brought my headlamp to get a peak at the sparklies inside the cave. Wouldn't want to be here in winter when a bear might be sleeping here!

As I was alone I was not brave enough to crawl in and scratch around as it was hibernation season and didn't want to annoy a bear!! Pushkin can decide if I can claim this as a find.

However, this tough little bugger did all three of us in, resulting in us calling up and getting the CO out with us to watch the hunt!! mackiewackie did us proud in the end thou, managing to find the cache without even getting a hint from the CO.

GPS was all over the place, no matter where I went I was 10 to 15 meters away, even when I went 30 meters up the road, damn thing almost took a dive in the river, if I didn't have 2 more caches to get to farther up the road. On the return trip I looked at the GPS as I approached the area, this time it was point to the opposite side of the road, excuse me now? what the hell? So I pulled over, got out and walked back, again with the 15 meter BS, but I did spot the hint as I drove by. I found the cache, but my GPS was indicating 29 meters farther up the hill from the find location.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7EMWN_lead-mine-road

gnome#4	Found it	5/29/2018	Day 33 I am out here on a two month Eastern Canada trip. I started off from Toronto and slowly made my way to the Maritimes. I caught the boat to Newfoundland. Cabot Trail and then PEI. My Dad flew into Montreal in mid June. My son into Hamilton a week later. From there, us three generations did a roadtrip back to BC, visiting family all along the way. I planned my entire trip by mapping out a route following earthcaches, virtuals and webcams. In two months, I visited about 400 of them. Currently, I have found nine of the ten provinces oldest or active caches. I only need to find Saskatchewan. I also have seven capital cities in the Great White North Geotour and hope to have all ten by the end of the summer. This has been an awesome trip and thanks to all the CO's who have created and maintained all the caches I have found and visited. Sweet! An FTF so far out of province. Thanks very much. I found this one about 20 metres off.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7EMWN_lead-mine-road

taylorstransfer	Found it	2/7/2019	Found with Riverbugs(after he realized the cache on the other side of the brook was just a beer can). Has been many a year since I've been here so thanks for bringing me back. Had a great tour guide with me today. Beautiful spot with lots of history, what more could you want.

THE RED FOX RAIDERS	Found it	11/12/2018	The Red Fox Raiders raided your cache today. After doing the nearby Earthcache we hike over to find your cache. Cool location with a nice small waterfall.

WiFi902	Found it	10/16/2018	FTF #665! What a spectacular spot! I was up early this morning but instead of heading out to cache I stayed in and decided I'd come to grab these two new geocaches this afternoon instead of in the morning. To be honest I thought the first to find was gone on this one. I read something on Facebook that made me think that it was gone but the comment was referring to the earth cache. Very typical of me to be misinformed and to misinterpret. Such a great spot and so close to the road. Not only is there a spectacular waterfall to see but there is a lot of history here with the nearby gold mining and adit. After signing the blank logbook here I took a couple videos and a few pictures then made my way towards the EC. On my way there I ran into Jessie&Sophie's mom. We had a nice chat and then parted ways. We met up again at the earth cache. This was a great way to spend the afternoon and I thoroughly enjoyed it. FP for the great location. SL with red sharpie.

Jessie&Sophie's mom	Found it	10/16/2018	Met wifi902 on the way in. 2nd to find. Nice hike. Sophie liked the hike but is tired now. Trailhead is off the paved road close to parking cords not off the gravel road. I really liked the cache container and log set up. Giving it a favorite. Forgot to bring my stamp so signed with a stick and some mud.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7Z1MG_rawdon-gold-mine-falls

Harlow0720	Found it	8/14/2019	Would never have found this without geocaching, an eery place, followed by 11km of what could be only described as an abandoned road. Much to the surprise of a few locals as we chased while helping change a tire for a lady on her way home from work along the Loch Lomand Rd.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC89YWE_sterling-mine
antigocache	Found it	8/14/2019	Out for an afternoon/evening cache tour with Harlow0720 today. We had just the right mix of park and grabs combined with some short and longer hikes today mixed with some incredible sights to make for a terrific caching day. This had to be our last cache of the night as darkness was fast setting in and we drove right into this one and didn't want to chance going for the other one as we feared the open gate may get locked in the meantime. This place is unreal, wish we had much more time to discover and explore, looks like quite the party spot back in here. Crazy sights to behold, I hope to be back to look around some more and go after the cache at the end of the desert haha. Fav point here for taking me to a cool spot! After finishing this cache, we needed to figure out the fastest route to try and get back to Antigonish so we took what looked like a pretty decent road on my basemap "Stirling Road". It said roughly 10.5 km until we came out onto Loch Lomond. Welllll now, the road was nothing more than an ATV trail for many sections of it but thankfully Harlow persisted and we got through and mercilessly came out on the other end after what felt like an hour through there. Adventure ended and another one started as we stopped a couple hundred metres away to assist a lady with a flat tire, quite the go ahead up in here... antigocache, tfth	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC89YWE_sterling-mine
CacherCook	Found it	8/11/2019	Back to the Framboise area on this sunny and breezy August Sunday afternoon with Sandy Queen. Other than the horrid "main road" everything went well. Picked up 10 caches today.. I imagine we'll be back again for a few more along Forchu... This was one of our finds for the day.. Met two young families near gz with a portable BBQ. cooking hotdogs.. odd place for a picnic.. the whole area was just odd. Wild graffiti and ruins..	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC89YWE_sterling-mine
MineRP	Found it	8/2/2019	Thought to get out for a little run, actually a long run after supper. Made horrendous mistake and took the Grand Mira North Road, or we could call it a path. Very warm and humid day. Another great surprise today, was amazed how much remained of the old site. Poked about for quite a while, appears Shaft2 is not filled, but has a safety grill on top. In the right light, the old processing plant looks like a Greek temple. Deer flies bad, Miner in shorts and a T. . Enjoyed the location, thanks for the hunt, signed log for credit. Include a few pictures. Did a lot of reading on the old mine, funny, first time here, will be back now that i have a site plan.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC89YWE_sterling-mine
Sportsman01	Found it	7/15/2019	FTF Woo Hoo! Set out today to clean up the Bean caches along the beach to Monroe Pt and cached our way back towards Grand River. I had driven through Stirling earlier in the spring and thought about exploring the old mine works but didn't have the time. This was quite a large operation. A few hazards to be careful of... lots of glass and metal debris laying about. Some serious art work installed on the remaining concrete structures. Reminded me of the Broughton area. Great fun!

[red]ARCHIVED: No Action Taken After Being Disabled[/red] Since the current owner has made no status change or updates on this geocache in a timely fashion following the previous Reviewer Note/Disabled Log, this listing is being [red]ARCHIVED[/red]. You may request that this listing be unarchived by email as provided below once you have repaired your geocache and as long as it meets the current Listing Guidelines.

CacheDrone	Post Reviewer Note	5/9/2009	I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled for a period of time well in excess of the period of "a few weeks" as contemplated by the cache guidelines published on Geocaching.com. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it (using the [i]archive listing[/i] link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location. If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b]log a note to the cache[/b] (not email) so I don't archive the listing for non-communication.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
Team Goju	Didn't find it	5/5/2009	I took the snowmobile trail up from 540, and approached the cache area from the clearing at the tower. Posted coordinates lead me to an area that didn't seem right. There are downed trees everywhere and no rocks anywhere. I double checked the coords. and wandered a little further but couldn't even spot a sign. Now that I have read some of the other logs, I wish I had the alternate coords posted by Canu Head. It was getting dark, and not having a flashlight I cut the search of and headed for the other nearby cache. Maybe next time.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave

krysteffer	Found it	9/25/2008	Pretty cool just happened to stumble accross it. Didn't know what it was but opened it and read all about this. Ended up taking a plastic donkey and left a deck of cards. I guess i should go out and buy a GPS now.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
canu_head	Found it	9/6/2008	:) We did find the cache after going through the same bushwacking experience mentioned in the last log. We had 2 GPSrs operating and both sent us 81 - 90m east of the trail into a flat cedar bush area near a rough, barely cleared trail (not part of the network). Knowing the trail I went to where I knew the Bear Cave was and followed the clue and found it easily. I did take a new waypoint reading above. After my eperience and the last poster seemingly going to the same 'no-person's land' I would save these co-ords as well. I didn't do an 'average' on the location as I didn't have much time left but it will be pretty close and follow the clue from there. The container is not exactly watertight and things were a little mouldy. I replaced the log-book zip-lock and didn't take anything out. Packed out quite a bit of garbage. If you go in please take a bag. This great trail needs a little TLC. Thanks, The Canoeheads	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
PsyJam	Didn't find it	7/13/2008	After walking up the ladder, finding the Manitou cache, and being generally tired, we bushwacked our way toward the posted cache location which was off of the beaten track. Nothing - there was nothing that even resembled a cave or rock wall in the area. The clue was very vague and there was no luck in finding the cache, although we did want to and we did try.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
PMC	Enable Listing	10/26/2007	BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND!!!!!!!!! The co-ordinates are a little off but as you all can see from the postings from experienced Geo Cachers, the cache is there and is worth looking for! The co-ordinates were changed at the request of previous cachers that I didn't feel should have had a problem however I changed them as requested and now the co-ordinates are inaccurate. The canopy layer plays havoc with a lot of units so use your judgement and HAVE FUN!!~!! Bring a Camera! Please record co-ordinates each time the cache is found to aid the next person ok!

Grey Falcons	Found it	9/22/2007	Although this cache was archived I felt I just had to try it. I was able to find cache by reading the hints provided.

tanda	Found it	8/9/2007	Even though this cache is temporarily unavailable, we felt it would be alright to go look for it anyway, as suggested by the owner. This was our 3rd find on this great trail and what a nice hiding spot, too! Thank you for bringing us here! We'll upload pictures when we're back in the Netherlands, right now we're still on holidays. We left a led light key chain and took a little frog. We didn't see the geocoin that's supposed to be in the cache.... TFTC and Happy hunting! Trijnie and Adam the Netherlands	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
PMC	Temporarily Disable Listing	7/10/2007	There have been too many complaints about the co-ordinates of this cache! Every person that has one this cache successfully can confirm that it is there and that it is a hard one to find. Half the people that have ever done this cache have complained that th co-ordinates were wrong and provided me with updated numbers. The co-ordinates of this cache have been changed at least 10 times and are still wrong???? I wish that all the so called experts would just stick to caching and forget about the "I'm better than you are" routine when it comes to co-ordinates and ratings etc... This cache will remain disabled untill I can find the time to hike the cliffs again later in the summer. For those that want to attempt this cache anyway, go ahead, it is there (confirmed at start of July by another cacher). To all those PROFESSIONAL Cachers out there that were unable to find the cache while the ametures were, might I suggest using a GPS instead of your portable computers or Blackberrys / Palm Pilots and use your eyes to look around for clues.

PMC	Write note	7/3/2007	Here we go again! This is by no means an easy cache to find, keep hidden or maintain. Half the contacts I get are finds that are accidental by people just hiking by, and the avid Geocachers can't seem to find it. The cache is a plastic cylinder with grey duct tape on it. It is hidden approximately 5 feet off the ground in a rock face on the left hand side of a path that leads off the beaten path of the trail system near the old M'Chigeeng sign (sorry about the spelling). There is a kind of rock stairway leading down around the lower level from the main path. There used to be a Bear Haven Sign here that pointed down the path. The area is not currently being maintained very well and so the signs have all disappeared. Do not be discouraged by the GPS signals bouncing around. When you are at the lookout, follow the trail back along the cliffs heading south west and you will find it! You came all this way, look around. This is NOT an easy CITY MICROCACHE "HIDDEN" on a Bridge Handrail! It's the BUSH. Caches should be hard to do and find otherwise we could stay home and watch Survivor. ENJOY!!!!!!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
scoutertom	Found it	7/2/2007	Found after someone on the trail said it was 140 metre from the coordinates.... and it was 140 metres....

Star2004	Found it	12/16/2006	Hiked in from Hwy 540 snowmobile trail for the two caches on this side. I had already hike the other way for the other cache. Found cache with clue and GPS said 140 meters to cache. Check the cave for Bears but it seemed empty. See picture of Bear print near cache. Took Travel Bug and left Geocoin. Thanks for the great cache. Star2004	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
astrogirl	Found it	10/8/2006	I agree with the other logs here - we found the cache without the use of our GPS (after ending up over 100 metres away in the bush using the original posted coordinates). I tried to grab coordinates at the cache, but had poor accuracy. Neat area - left a TB and took the x-acto knife (who puts those into caches?!). Thanks for bringing us here!. #265. ~astrogirl	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
rovers3	Found it	9/25/2006	We really need to read the logs before doing the caches as we were in the thick bush and realized that there must be something wrong.

Sludge_Shoveler	Found it	8/24/2006	Found at 1:40 PM while on vacation from Holt, Michigan. My GPSr was sending me away from the cave. I used the hints to find the cache. When I got there my GPSr said I was 450' from the cache. The contents of the cache were dripping wet and the logbook was worthless. I dried it out as best I could. I happened to have a spare logbook in my geopack, so I donated it to the cache. This is my 400th cache! Took: tape measure. Left: sigcompass.

PMC	Write note	8/16/2006	In response to the most recent posting, you are correct the coordinates are off by a bit because of the tree cover and most importantly the cliff! My note previous to your's clearly states this. I have changed the coordinates before to satisfy a few people and now everyone is unhappy with the coordinates again. I invite everyone who finds this cache to include the coordinates they get and we will let the next cacher decide who's are most usefull. Have fun on this hike people, that's what cach'n is all about! PMC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
actus reus	Found it	8/6/2006	I take serious issue with the co-ordinates as presented. I would suggest that everyone is better off simply heading down the crevice where the sign says "Bear Cave" and leaving the GPS in their pocket. The co-ordinates put me about 110 m off course. Go near the bear cave sign and look around. Having said all of that, I loved this spot. This is one not to be missed. Left a glass fish fridge magnet and took nothing.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
PMC	Write note	11/14/2005	Hello CACHERS! The posted co-ordinates are those of an experienced cacher in the area (not me) and differ from my original ones. Please post new co-ordinates if you have them. They may help someone else. Also post gthe type of GPSR you are using as this may also help. The cache is the level below Priceboy's Get er Done cache. Follow the signs to the Bear Cave. The co-ordinates are more easily tracked in from the upper level as the location of the cache does not lend itself to satelite tracking. Anyhow, enjoy the view.

George Eh	Found it	11/11/2005	Found this one on our 2nd attempt as the coordinates were way off on our first foray and we didn't have the sheet to check for alternate coordinates. We entered at the skiddoo trail on the McChigeeng hill and preferred this hike over the entrance at the park. The alternate coords were good and Mrs. Eh and I had no trouble finding the cache this time. I took the carabiner and left an exacto knife. Nice hike and the hill is a good workout for the lungs and heart.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
George Eh	Write note	11/2/2005	Mrs. Eh and I were going to include this cache while seeking The Manitou and Ger Er' Dun Bell but when I reached the coordinates I had punched in, it looked like I was way off. We then continued up the trail to the next cache and planned to double back but we never did. We went down the steps at the big sign and no way did I want to go back up as I was carrying the dog. We will return with old coordinates and new ones in log and hopefully find the cache, this area is well worth the effort.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
timberwolf1212	Found it	9/5/2005	It took us a little while to find this one, because we were going the opposite way on the trail at first. Low batteries in the GPS, I suppose.

mechx2	Found it	8/20/2004	Good cache, but it took a bit of seaching to find it. It was worth the search, neat spot. We hid the cache well so it wouldn't be accidentally discovered. Took the travel bug and will give it a new home soon, also too the small wrench and left a metallic ball. We found this cache while hiking with Brian and Mary. I added new co-ordinates above.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
Priceboy & Lulubell	Write note	7/31/2004	Dropped Dalton TB inside, took RJO and will relocate.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
Priceboy & Lulubell	Found it	7/31/2004	Nice day on Saturday, so took a ride to M'Chigeeng. Nice cache buddy. 2 of 3 for the day. We like El Dee had to use the clue and realized you are 130m off you clown! Good thing you replaced that old Dinosaur with a Garmin Rino120, good move. NOTE TO ALL CACHERS - for now use the clue "Bear Cave" sign on the Main Trail as per PMC's note, follow the rock around to the left to the "BEAR CAVE" and look at the clue for the rest. Didn't take long to find. Dropped of T.B. from my cache and took RJO, will relocate. PMC, I have new co-ordinates in my truck, see you soon. P.S. I left an instruction sheet "found it, log it Geocaching.com page (laminated of course). It appears that numerous people (non-cachers) are finding your cache without the use of a GPS opening it up, seeing what is inside and logging in the book, but they were unsure what to do with it. The laminated instruction sheet will help! Priceboy w. Lulubell ( I put a T.B. in here too )	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave
El Dee	Found it	7/7/2004	Found this one by the clue only. My reading at the top where the main trail meets the trail down to the bear cave was 130 m off. Took small wrench, left nail clippers. It was after 9 pm and starting to get dark. Had to use flashlight to find cache and write in log book. No bears home today,think maybe this is just native folklore, LOL. Thanks for the cache, El Dee.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJWAC_bear-cave

Buttons.	Found it	11/18/2006	First stop of the day and finally it was there. Lots of people fishing again today. Thanks for the cache. Buttons and Beaux.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Loggers Journey	Found it	11/18/2006	*** #1117 *** As Annie mentioned we made a few visits here, each one unsuccessful. It sure is nice to get this one off of the list finally. Area was packed as usual but their attention was on the good old fishing hole. A little slight of hand and the cache was ours. Thanks for the cache. Happy Caching!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Amazon Annie	Found it	11/18/2006	We'd been here before but it was missing each time. Now that it had been replaced we were lucky enough to be able to log it before it goes missing again. Lots of fisherpersons out there even early this morning.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Rain_Beaux	Found it	11/17/2006	First stop of the day and finally it was there. Lots of people fishing again today.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
rovers3	Found it	11/10/2006	Very quiet here on a cool cloudy morning. I had checked this area previously didn't spend much time then as there were a lot of muggles fishing and I had decided to try again later. Now I see that the cache must have been MIA. Quick find today as GPSr led me straight to it. TFTC rovers3,	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Balok	Found it	11/5/2006	I was convinced the cache was in a certain spot, and it took a bit of effort to get at. I was right. A few kids playing in the water nearby. Pretty sure they had no clue was I was doing.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Keith Watson	Found it	11/3/2006	Stooped by for a little friendly maintenance after a fellow cacher asked me to stop by and place a new container. Too nice a spot to let this one get archived.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
northernpenguin	Found it	11/3/2006	Much easier find than micros typically are for me. Came here with Keith Watson. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Suzie Homemaker	Write note	11/3/2006	I have it on good autority that the cache has been replaced. Happy hunting.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
tinkertoad	Didn't find it	10/29/2006	Lots of fishermen out today. Spent some time looking in some likely spots, but after reading the last couple logs things didn't seem too hopeful... intersting spot, in any case.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Amazon Annie	Didn't find it	10/14/2006	Searched around today with Logger and Buttons and Beaux but came up empty. The spot that looked like it could have been correct looked like a large amount of water had washed through there lately. Maybe we missed it? Quite a busy spot!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
willipan	Found it	10/14/2006	But, Hil, and I spent a long time searching, but never quite found it! We also spent a lot of time watching the fishermen catch a 20-pound salmon, release it up the waterfalls, only to have it swim back down again. I left my printout of this cache in my car, because I wasn't expecting to come to this one directly, so I didn't have the clue and I didn't even know what type of container we were searching for. I did see a white film container right in the open in a puddle at ground zero, but didn't think anything of it, since I thought we were looking for a "regular" cache, instead of a "micro". The film container didn't have a lid or any logbook in it - I just thought that it belonged to the fishermen! The fishermen said that the water comes way up over the rocks in the spring, so we figured the coordinates were off and started searching closer to the bike path, to no avail. When I returned to my car and read the printout that said it was a white film container, it clicked that we'd seen it and it had been MUGGLED! Anyway, thanks for taking me to a great spot I didn't know existed!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Rideau Rangers	Found it	9/9/2006	Excellent! Right in among the muggles just as a fisherman caught a 20 lb salmon. Everyone was focused on the fish...except Ranger 2! TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
CastNoShadows	Found it	9/4/2006	Nice area, I should have brought a rod for some fishing	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
NorMin & Ruffy	Found it	9/4/2006	Turned out to be a surprisingly quick find. Guess the salmon are just starting their run upstream, according to the nearby fishermen. TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Fish Below The Ice	Found it	9/3/2006	I found this easily, despite all the fly fishermen taking advantage of the raging river. tftc.. dave	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
jtannahi	Found it	9/3/2006	Nice walk on a drizzly morning - quick find - water is coming over the rocks at side of falls but would still take a fair bit more to reach the cache. SL. Many thanks	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Nozzletime	Found it	8/28/2006	Finally crossed this one off the list. Thanks Nozzletime & Smudge	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls

TOMTEC	Found it	8/27/2006	Found this one accompanied by Spike... I wonder if the water ever comes over the top during heavy rain? I hope not! TOMTEC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
teamdljka	Found it	8/22/2006	An easy find, nice place for a picnic too.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
red headed fury	Found it	8/12/2006	Found with 1701eh. Finally logging all the caches that I found with Tony, under my own caching name. Some very good memories of Tony - thanks.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
1701eh	Found it	8/12/2006	The new location should be okay (might be unavailable after heavy rain). I had a look at where I guess it was originally hidden, and it did not look safe. Thanx, Tony	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Anna-Conda	Found it	8/10/2006	Thanks for the cache Micheal. From Anna next door!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls

res2100	Found it	8/10/2006	Went for a walk this evening and found the cache. Lots of muggles around but they didn't notice us. I think the actual cave is neat too and we explored that too.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Ellesche2100	Found it	8/10/2006	Went along with the cache owner, res2100, Tylor and Anaconda as they replaced it. I have been here hundreds of times. Thanks for the cache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls

Michael10	Update Coordinates	8/10/2006	Not sure why this was archived. The water was low today when we checked on it and had no problem getting into the "cave". Decided to move it a few meters so that it would be more accessable.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls

fearlessbob	Didn't find it	8/2/2006	We searched quite bit for this one, to no avail. Then we read the previous logs, indicating not much luck for the previous cachers either. We moved on... FearlessBob along with etrekker_mtl	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Suzie Homemaker	Didn't find it	8/1/2006	This was our last cache of the day. After standing out in the sun looking for awhile we decided we were all done in. Unfortunate to end with a DNF but with the heat it was too much to bear any more. I headed back to my air conditioned house and a cold shower.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Keith Watson	Needs Archived	8/1/2006	Looked for it today using 5 sets of eyes, and after reading the logs, I am pretty sure the cache is gone.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Buttons.	Didn't find it	7/23/2006	Was in the area so we took a quick look. The water was up to the top of the cave. One would need scuba gear to attemp this as the cave was totally under water. Just wounder how the cache could survive.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
capjap	Didn't find it	7/23/2006	The water was up pretty high after the rain we've had the past two days. Don't think it is accessible at all, and downright dangerous to try.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Buttons.	Didn't find it	7/16/2006	Spent about 45 minutes looking for this one with no luck. Buttons and Beaux.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Nozzletime	Didn't find it	7/16/2006	After seeign all the found it logs, I am not sure if it is there or not anymore after the storm this week. We spent the better part of a half hour looking but came up empty. Any additional hints would be welcome. Thanks Nozzletime & Smudge	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
zahadoom	Write note	7/11/2006	Was here today, I'm sure everyone has heard what happened Up this creek Yesterday, with the young boy drowning. I was by here today, and thought I'd see how this cache faired that storm. The water even today, a day later, was HIGH and fast running. Right up to the LIP of this concrete. SEE PIC. I looked in the cave, all wet. If the cache wasnt held down or ROCK it might not be there anymore. (SEE pic 2, SPOILER) Water was flowing in the cave today, its hard to see from the picture, but the left wall of the cave the water was higher on the other side than you would be if you climbed in here.. From the surrounding grass you can see the water was WELL over all this concrete during the storm. Almost 2m up the riverbanks on either side all the plants are matted down... Anyways interested to see if it survived, I wasnt climbing in there...	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
rovers3	Write note	7/11/2006	The birds you saw are Black-crowned night herons. rovers3	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Jake's Goldilocks	Found it	7/9/2006	Ran into Ogof at this cache location. He was busy at work as were a little preoccupied working on another cache solution. Ogof came up with the find and passed it to us to sign. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Ogof	Found it	7/9/2006	Good hide, didnt take too long to find. Left a sheep as the cache was empty apart from a log sheet. The cache container is also split along the base and so any damp weather would really ruin it.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
zahadoom	Didn't find it	7/7/2006	Was out there today after work, I DNF'd 4 of 4 today, I think im going to have to rename myself DNF King. Maybe my GPS was acting up today or something. But was I suppost to climb up under that lip of concrete by the falls? When I was standing on top of it, I read 1m. But after seeing underneith I wonder how long that will last. I looked underneith, didnt see it there. I didnt want to leave my bike around too long, alot of strange people on the trail tonight..	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
chris-mouse	Found it	7/7/2006	Interesting spot. there's a couple of very unusual birds hanging around the spot I managed to get a good photo of one of them. I wonder if they're a mated pair. The cache is well hidden, BUT... I suspect that approaching this cache would be very dangerous when then creek rises after a good thunderstorm. It's also almost guaranteed to be removed by the spring thaw, unless a thunderstorm has removed it first.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
jeff-trex	Found it	7/5/2006	stoped by before work today to grab this one. ended up finding a parking spot about 190 m away. found a nice trail that took me right to the cache site. I figured out this cache was here as I had been to the falls a few other times for the other caches along here. Coords were right on for me. I started searching the spot a few times. Then met up with Gordetob and we continued searching. I checked one more spot and there is was. Great location you picked for this one but cache may not hang around too long (especially after a good heavy rain fall or spring thaw). TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
GordEtob	Found it	7/5/2006	As I moved in on ground zero, a head popped out of the cache area! It was Jeff-trex! We searched a bit more, but he spotted the cache quickly. Thanks Jeff -- you saved me from risking my sore ankle climbing around those rocks! TFTC TNLNSL @ 5:15 P.M. 1st of 3 today; #596 GordEtob	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls

Zoeker Bill	Found it	7/4/2006	Raced over here after work with Cammanron in an attempt to get a FTF. Alas we had to settle for a STF. Nice spot. We watched two blue herons feasting on the abundance of small fish. Dropped off a geocoin. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCWWYJ_cave-falls
Team Goju	Found it	7/4/2006	Saw this one listed when I got home from work, and figured I had an outside chance of a FTF. Quinn & I got there around 4:30, but there was a couple of muggles fishing right on top of the cache. We decided to walk right over to them and just hang around, and they left within minutes....hehehe. As soon as they started to leave Quinn dissappeared into the "cave" and located it quickly.
