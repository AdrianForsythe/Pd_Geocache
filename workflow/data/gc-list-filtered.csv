opened on existing prehistoric excavations located on adventure bluff these prehistoric workings date to about 5000 years ago and were very extensive the mine consisted of five shafts four were inclined at 45 degrees to follow the ore body and one was vertical the deepest of these shafts the no 3 contained 13 levels and extended down 1300 feet following the ore body the adventure mine was incorporated several different times trying to develop a profitable mine on adventure bluff although the adventure mine always showed great promise and millions of dollars were spent pursuing that dream the mine always won out in the end it never produced a profit local geology this area was covered by hundreds of large lava flows approximately 11 billion years ago when lava erupts gasses which had been trapped in the lava bubble to the surface and create a frothy layer similar to a can of soda when opened the lava cooled and formed bedrock with a solid bottom part and a porous top part similar to a sponge in appearance each subsequent lava flow buried the previous one creating a layered effect solid basalt the grayish color rock in the area porous basalt solid basalt the porous basalt and so on the eruptions occurred for an approximately 2 million year long time span the basalt lava flows covered an area from the keweenaw peninsula to isle royale as the basalt lava continued erupting after it ceased parts of the area were covered by reddish colored conglomerates rhyolite these conglomerates were then covered by the reddish sandstone common to this area later to be know as jacobsville sandstone these deposits occurred roughly 1 billion years ago the stack of lava flows or basalt conglomerates and sandstones layers of bedrock was then compressed from the sides due to tremendous pressures caused by the moving of earths crust plate tectonics the bedrock layers began to bend from the pressure and changed from basically flat lying to bowl shaped picture taking a thick book and pressing on it from the ends originally the pages are flat and straight but push hard enough and the book will begin to bend into a u shape one end of the u became the keweenaw peninsula the other end isle royale and the space in the middle the inside of the u is lake superior glaciers have eroded away the bedrock unevenly so the layers at the surface are not quite as obvious as they were when formed glaciers have also carved out most of the land features including adventure mountain but in most places you still find sandstones and conglomerates along the lake shore and basalt further away from the lake the copper the copper here was deposited after the lava eruptions were finished and after the formations of the conglomerates and sandstones basically the copper precipitated out of warm ground water hydrothermal solutions many people that have well water get iron or rust stains in their sinks from dripping water this iron precipitates from their well water and deposits itself onto their sink the copper in the bedrock formed the same way given enough time large quantities of copper were deposited by filling voids in the bedrock where the water was flowing through now to put this all together if water is flowing through bedrock there must be cracks and porous sections of rock that allow this to occur the copper was deposited only in the top porous sections of the basalt lava flows this is how we came to have parallel lodes of copper in the adventure mine the copper occurs only in the lava flow top sections so only those areas were ever mined the solid part of the basalt lava has no copper as discussed before the bedrock layers were bent from pressure and this is why the lodes at the adventure mine are inclined at 45 degrees if you walk in the mine and see some of the larger stopes areas of copper lodes that have been mined away and are now open they are all inclined upward at approximately a 45 degree incline the conglomerates had areas of rich copper deposits where copper had filled in areas between the stones and cobbles there were also some shales that had enough open space to allow copper deposits mostly in the cracks and fissures in the rocks most of the very large masses of native copper mined were formed as the result of a copper filled fissure native copper all the copper mined here occurs in metallic natural native form it is not chemically combined with any other minerals this is very rare the only other place in the world where native copper occurs in quantities significant enough to mine is in coro coro bolivia in south america the keweenaw is the only place in the world where copper occurs in natural pieces weighing more than a few pounds the largest piece mined from the adventure mine weighed approximately 24 tons most of all the copper mined elsewhere today occurs in oxidized copper deposits containing little or no metallic copper these oxidized deposits must be treated by various chemical processes to yield metallic copper mine terms stopes stopes are large underground rooms from which ore is removed they are formed when miners drill numerous holes into the rock wall called the working face these holes are then loaded with explosives and detonated the blast breaks the working face and rock into pieces small enough to be loaded into mine cars and carried from the mine shaft a vertical or sloping

highways to make it easily accessible to all of eastern north america generally there are four categories of silica deposits cretaceous quartzose sand and gravel late carboniferous quartzose sandstone and quartzpebble conglomeration neoproterozoicsilurian quartzite and quartz veins a small outcrop of quartz silica sand has been recognized at vinegar hill near cassidy lake south of sussex new brunswick since the 1980s and extracted for commercial purposes the deposit lies over carboniferous rocks and under glacial deposits its setting is very similar to comparable confirmed cretaceous deposits in nova scotia the silicarich deposit at cassidy lake is made up of quartzose sand and quartzpebble to quartzcobble sized gravel other cretaceous sand and gravel deposits similar to those at cassidy lake have yet to be located in new brunswcik however deposits may exist in structurally similar settings including the area immediately south of the harveyhopewell fault in southeastern new brunswick given the economic and scientific interest of the vinegar hill deposit a search for similar outcrops would be worthwhile although silica mining has been explored in various areas of new brunswick including bass river near belldune the burchill road quartzite deposit southwest of saint john and white head and nantucket islands in southwestern new brunswick the cassidy lake deposit near sussex is new brunswicks most productive and longstanding silica operation the silica was first noted in the late 1970s when a potash exploration drillhole intersected 150 m of white quartzose material when the silica unit was drilltested and analyzed results indicated a reserve of 167 mt of highgrade 9899 sio in the form of poorly consolidated cretaceous sand and gravel the cassidy lake operation started production in 1986 under what became sussex silica inc and a processing plant was erected on site atlantic silica inc acquired the sussex silica assets in 1993 and currently manages the quarry and facilities nova scotiabased interests took ownership of atlantic silica in early 2003 the head office of the company is in enfield nova scotia and the mine is located at poodiac near cassidy lake new brunswick the mine employing nine persons operates on a fulltime basis for eight months of the year and relies on its stored inventory for the remaining winter months silica resources at cassidy lake comprise about 20 mt of material averaging >99 sio the processing plant sells its silica products across eastern canada and the northeastern united states end uses of the sand and pebblesized materials include silicon metal silicon carbide glass recreational sand decorative stone filtration sand foundry sand refractory sand smelter flux cement additive landscaping material and construction sand the company operates a washing screening and drying plant on the mine site which has a capacity of 140 metric tonnes per hour products required to be dry are processed and packaged at a rate of 30 to 50 tonnes per hour the silica deposit covered by one to twelve metres of overburden is a 98 percent pure unconsolidated natural deposit of sand and gravel quartz the deposit is approximately 1500 metres long by 600 metres wide the material is consistent with depth to the extent of 16 metre drill holes the depth of the deposit is unknown proven reserves are 18 million tonnes probable reserves are 50 million tonnes to 32 metres depth and 100 million tonnes to 65 metres ore depth the plant was originally developed to supply the quebec and northern new brunswick markets for silicon metal silicon carbide and metallurgical flux in 1989 a successful pilot test was conducted to prove the material was suitable for glass products both container and flat glass the company still hopes to become a regular supplier of glass sand since inception asi has increasingly become a supplier of a wide variety of sand products including blasting sands nursery grits golf course sand both bunker and green drainage filtration media foundry sand refractory sand cement additives concrete aggregate traction sand for roads railways and airports plaster sand and decorative sands including pebbles these products are shipped to a wide variety of locations throughout eastern canada and northeastern usa all current shipping is by road transport which services the mine site cn rail is

grow weak and the nervous system convulses potash is marketed primarily as fertilizer small quantities are also sold to the pulp and paper industry and to makers of soaps detergents glass drugs and furnace fluxes a primary source of potassium is the mineral sylvite kcl which often occurs as an intergrowth with another mineral halite salt or nacl the mixture is known as potash or sylvinite the higher the mixture of sylvinite content the higher the grade of potash ore potash was formed during the mississippian age during that time much of what is now southeast new brunswick possessed a hot and arid climate and lay beneath an extensive shallow sea the seawater slowly evaporated over time causing potassium and other salts to precipitate from the brine much like a salt solution is left on a plate when the liquid dries after the ocean receded thick layers of other sediments buried the potash and related deposits where they remained undisturbed for 325 million years salt deposits were first discovered in the sussex area in the early 1800s when area residents tapped local salt springs dried the brine to produce halite which they used in food preservation in 1971 government geologists drilled two holes east of sussex hoping to discover commercial salt deposits they discovered salt and thick beds of potash potash was discovered in large quantities in the area surrounding sussex with the deposit being the second largest in the world after an area in saskatchewan two mines were built near the town one in penobsquis 8 km east and another at cassidy lake 10 km southeast cn rail built trackage to serve both mines which employed hundreds from the surrounding area in the 1900s new brunswick had two worldclass potash mining and processing facilities namely the potash corporation of saskatchewan incs new brunswick division and cassidy lake division until recently the cassidy lake division mined and provided the company with custom and selected valueadded processing the new brunswick division at penobsquis functions as an integrated minemill facility in 2002 exploratory drilling southeast of the mine has resulted in the discovery of additional and potentially significant potash reserves the expansion is expected to more than double the annual potash production potash is mined underground at a depth of between 400 to 700 meters machines known as roadheaders are used to remove potash ore underground these huge mining machines have a rotary cutting head mounted on a boom and can excavate 300 to 500 tonnes of potash ore per hour they crawl forward along a working face slowly swinging the boom up and down and back and forth the machine excavates potash ore in the front and gathers it onto a conveyor belt at the rear pcs mills its ore into four commercial grades granular coarse standard and fine the processed potash is loaded onto railcars and carried by train to storage facilities in saint john from there it is shipped to western europe the united sates central and south america asia and oceania rock salt is also mined and is used for road salt approximately half of the production stays in new brunswick while the rest is shipped through the us northeast typically underground potash deposits are overlain by water bearing formations that pose considerable threat to the ongoing operation of potash mines there have been a number of potash mine floods over the past 30 years including new brunswick beginning about 1997 the sussex potash mine began experiencing a brine inflow problem that has increased every year peaking last year at about 1800 gpm us gallons per minute grouting efforts into the inflow zone along with sustained drilling and grouting efforts underground have sealed at least some of the flow paths and have helped to stem the flow of brine into the mine but at this time the source of the water has not been determined the cassidy lake division potash was mined to the south east of cassidy lake the mine was opened by dennison and was later purchased by the potash company of canada limiteds potacan mining co property in the late 1900s areas of the mine began to flood shortly after it was allowed to flood completely and production was terminated in 1998 potash corporation of saskatchewan inc purchased the properties in new brunswick a flooded mine and a functioning mill the flooded mine was renamed cassidy lake division of pcs at the time of closure the annual capacity of the mine was 13 million tonnes today the mine acts as water storage for its sister operation in penobsquis currently a small group of employees manage the companys brine pipeline to the bay of fundy approximately 300 350 tanker trucks haul brine from the sussex mine daily most of these tanker trucks haul the brine to the cassidy lake division the brine hauled to cassidy lake is a slurry of potash in brine the slurry is deposited into holding lagoons where the brine is taken off and pumped via the brine pipeline to be deposited into the bay of fundy in the area of giffins pond just south of st martins the remaining tanker trucks haul brine to the companys potash terminal in saint john for disposal into the bay the community continues to be concerned about the transport of brine from the new brunswick production site to the cassidy lake site for disposal especially with truck safety and speed and the company is addressing these concerns recently a 30km brine pipeline was built to ship excess brine from the penobsquis mine site to the companys brine pond at cassidy lake and into the bay of fundy this has lowered the daily volume of brine hauled away to less than half the 2008 volume in 2015 the cassidy lake mine building was demolished in 2016 the potash mines in penobsquis were closed as well

have some part that does not receive daylight however in popular usage the term includes smaller spaces like sea caves rock shelters and grottos caves are formed by geologic processes these may involve a combination of chemical processes erosion from water tectonic forces microorganisms pressure and atmospheric influences most caves are formed in limestone by dissolution solutional caves may form anywhere with rock that is soluble and are most prevalent in limestone but can also form in other material including chalk dolomite marble granite salt sandstone fossilized coral and gypsum the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with h2co3 carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes sinking streams and underground drainage limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation this include flowstones stalactites stalagmites helictites draperies soda straws and columns these secondary mineral deposits in caves are called speleothems the worlds most spectacularly decorated cave is generally regarded to be lechuguilla cave new mexico usa lechuguilla and nearby carlsbad caverns are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave they were formed by h2s hydrogen sulfide gas rising from below where reservoirs of oil give off sulfurous fumes this gas mixes with ground water and forms h2so4 sulfuric acid the acid then dissolves the limestone from below rather than from above by acidic water percolating from the surface some caves are formed at the same time as the surrounding rock these are sometimes called primary caves lava tubes are formed through volcanic activity and are the most common primary caves the lava flows downhill and the surface cools and solidifies the hotter lava continues to flow under that crust and if most of the liquid lava beneath the crust flows out a hollow tube remains thus forming a cavity examples of such caves can be found on tenerife big island and many other places kazumura cave near hilo is a remarkably long and deep lava tube it is 656 kilometers 408 mi long sea caves are found along coasts around the world a special case is littoral caves which are formed by wave action in zones of weakness in sea cliffs often these weaknesses are faults but they may also be dykes or beddingplane contacts some wavecut caves are now above sea level because of later uplift elsewhere in places such as thailands phang nga bay solutional caves have been flooded by the sea and are now subject to littoral erosion sea caves are generally around 5 meters 16 ft to 50 meters 160 ft in length but may exceed 300 meters 980 ft glacier caves occur in ice and under glaciers formed by melting they are also influenced by the very slow flow of the ice which tends to close the caves again these are sometimes called ice caves though this term is properly reserved for caves that contain yearround ice formations fracture caves are formed when layers of more soluble minerals such as gypsum dissolve out from between layers of less soluble rock these rocks fracture and collapse in blocks talus caves are the openings between rocks that have fallen down into a pile often at the bases of cliffs anchihaline caves are caves usually coastal containing a mixture of freshwater and saline water usually sea water they occur in many parts of the world and often contain highly specialized and endemic faunas branchwork caves resemble surface dentritic stream patterns they are made up of passages that join downstream as tributaries branchwork caves are the most common of cave patterns and are formed near sinkholes where groundwater recharge occurs each passage or branch is fed by a separate recharge source and converges into other higher order branches downstream angular network caves form from intersecting fissures of carbonate rock that have had fractures widened by chemical erosion these fractures form high narrow straight passages that persist in widespread closed loops anastomotic caves largely resemble surface braided streams with their passages separating and then meeting further down drainage they usually form along one bed or structure and only rarely cross into upper or lower beds spongework caves are formed as solution cavities are joined by mixing of chemically diverse water the cavities form a pattern that is threedimensional and random resembling a sponge ramiform caves form as irregular large rooms galleries and passages these randomized threedimensional rooms form from a rising water table that erodes the carbonate rock with hydrogensulfide enriched water caves are found throughout the world but only a portion of them have been explored and documented by cavers the distribution of documented cave systems is widely skewed toward countries where caving has been popular for many years such as france italy australia the uk the united states etc as a result explored caves are found widely in europe asia north america and oceania but are sparse in south america africa and antarctica this is a great generalization as large expanses of north america and asia contain no documented caves whereas areas such as the madagascar dry deciduous forests and parts of brazil contain many documented caves as the worlds expanses of soluble bedrock are researched by cavers the distribution of documented caves is likely to shift for example china despite containing around half the worlds exposed limestone more than 1000000 square kilometers 390000 sq mi has relatively few documented caves this cave has been made by water and wind causing the limestone rock and dirt under the rock to erode away to form a big cave a big cave big enough for a lot of animals or even people to hide and seek shelter

the tips of the formations stalactites grow down from the ceiling and form as mineral layers are deposited by water flowing over the outside of the soda straws they form after the centers of the hollow soda straws become plugged stalagmites grow up from the floor where mineral laden water drips from above stalagmites stalagmites are often but not always found beneath stalactites they have flat or rounded tops as compared to the carrot shaped stalactites columns columns are formed when stalactites and stalagmites grow together or when one of them grows all the way to the floor or ceiling cave coral grapes cave coral or popcorn is irregular clusters or rough knobs of crystalline calcium carbonate they build up on walls and existing formations as mineralladen water seeps through the pores of the rocks draperies cave bacon draperies form where drops of mineralladen water trickle down the undersides of inclined ceilings leaving deposits in lines which fold and curl as if they were drapes of curtains flowstone forms where films of water flow over walls floors and formations depositing sheets of calcium carbonate like icing another interesting fact about cascade cave and many other caves in the park is that its home to thousands of bats i could see bats hanging inside the cave as i walked about looking at the beauty the cave offered me to see the bats seemed to be unaffected by the visitors in its home bats are not as dangerous as once believed i can remember as a child the stories told by adults that bats are attracted to blonde hair and attacked people just to be mean bats are actually harmless and keep the local insect population in check bats do sometimes carry rabies the only way you could get rabies from a bat is to handle a bat leave them alone and they will leave you alone carter caves state resort park covers 2000 acres of rolling hills a manmade lake eight hiking trails that meander through high cliffs deep gorges natural bridges and hardwood forests and dozens of caves although only a handful are open to the public cascade cave is open yearround and requires no special clothing or equipment to visit there are other caves to visit in the park however you must check in with the visitor center to find out the park regulations before caving the only way to enter the cave is by signing up for the cascade cave tour at the visitor center

kentucky naturalist john muir stopped at lesserknown horse cave in his book a thousandmile walk to the gulf muir wrote of the place it seems a noble gateway to the birthplace of springs and fountains and the dark treasuries of the mineral kingdom this cave lies in a village of the same name which it supplies with an abundance of cold water cold air issues from its fernclad lips in hot weather crowds of people sit about in the shade of the trees that guard it this magnificent fan is capable of cooling everybody in town at once within 50 years of muirs visit horse cave had become one of americas most notorious examples of groundwater pollution in the 1920s and 30s raw sewage thick with spoiled whey from a local creamery was piped directly into the underground stream the magnificent fan spread the stench for miles making the town virtually uninhabitable every summer for 6 decades chromium and other chemicals from a metalplating factory further polluted the abundance of cold water in 1987 after nearly 50 years of closure the american cave conservation association acca located its national headquarters on the hidden river cave grounds and began efforts to restore and reopen the cave as the cave began to recover opportunities for exploration opened up the american cave and karst center opened in july 1992 and has since been visited by nearly 100000 people the center uses

resources formation of limestone and caverns many years ago the earth was covered with shallow oceans in these oceans were strange forms of life that used the lime from the sea water to form their shell homes as they died they settled to rest on the ocean floor their shells grew deeper and deeper at the bottom of the ocean under the pressure of the ocean water the shells were pressed down into rock we now call limestone when the continents collided the force of the collision uplifted the limestone to form the appalachian mountains the land was pelted by torrential rain and this water flowed through the cracks and crevices slowly widening them into the rooms and passageways we walk through today the process stopped when the water table lowered and air enttered the cavern this condition allowed rain water to seep down through the soil and limestone as it still does today carrying with it a mineral called calcium carbonate lime when this mineral hits the air in the cavern it crystallizes forming speleothems commonly called cave formations these crystals are known as calcium crystals speleothems form at varying rates depending upon the amount of water entering the caverns and the temperature of the outside air on an average it takes 120 years for a cubic inch to form speleothems speleothems take various forms depending on whether the water drips seeps condenses flows or ponds dripstone is calcium carbonate in the form of stalactites or stalagmites stalactites are pointed pendants hanging from the cave ceiling from which they grow soda straws are very thin but long stalactites having an elongated cylindrical shape rather than the usual more conical shape of stalactites helictites are stalactites that have a central canal with twiglike or spiral projections that appear to defy gravity chandeliers are complex clusters of ceiling decorations stalagmites are the groundup counterparts of stalactites often seen as blunt mounds broomstick stalagmites are very tall and spindly totem pole stalagmites are also tall and shaped like their namesakes columns result when stalactites and stalagmites meet or when stalactites reach the floor of the cave flowstone is sheetlike and found on cave floors and walls draperies or curtains are thin wavy sheets of calcite hanging downward bacon is a drapery with variously colored bands within the sheet rimstone dams or gours occur at stream ripples and form barriers that may contain water stone waterfall formations simulate frozen cascades cave crystals dogtooth spar are large calcite crystals often found near seasonal pools frostwork is needlelike growths of calcite or aragonite moonmilk is white and cheeselike anthodites are flowerlike clusters of aragonite crystals speleogens technically distinct from speleothems are formations within caves that are created by the removal of bedrock rather than as secondary deposits these include pillars scallops boneyard boxwork others popcorn is small knobby clusters of calcite cave pearls are the result of water dripping from high above causing small seed crystals to turn over so often that they form into nearperfect spheres of calcium carbonate

construction of us route 22 thirteen months later on june 25 1931 it was opened to the public as hiwaymay caverns when myron dunlavy sr found out about the availability of hiwaymay caverns he entered into a fiveyear leasepurchase agreement from 1932 until 1937 the name was william penn caverns after purchasing the business myron sr decided to honor the president he most admired changing the name to lincoln caverns myron dunlavy jr came to huntingdon as a teenager to work at lincoln caverns and attend juniata college in huntingdon like his father he was an avid caver and spent much of his spare time digging in sinkholes atop warrior ridge looking for other caves on the property in september of 1941 he discovered whisper rocks in 1972 myron jrs daughter ann dunlavy returned to huntingdon and worked at the cave as a guide while attending juniata college in 1977 she returned to huntingdon to become manager and caretaker of lincoln caverns the operation of the caverns has remained a family affair with anns mother marion dunlavy serving as secretarytreasurer and myron serving as president until the time of his death in december 2005 when touring a solutional cave one formed below the water table you are actually inside the groundwater system lincoln tunnel lincoln tunnel was blasted in 1984 to eliminate crossing route 22 to enter the cave the gray rock you see around the entrance is actually gunnite sprayed concrete used to stabilize the rocks following the blasting mystery room mr dunlavy drove a pipe through the bank of laterite cave clay and discovered

in the surface topography caused by the removal of soil or bedrock often both by water sinkholes may vary in size from less than a meter to several hundred meters both in diameter and depth and vary in form from soillined bowls to bedrockedged chasms they may be formed gradually or suddenly and are found worldwide sinkholes are usually but not always linked with karst landscapes in such regions there may be hundreds or even thousands of sinkholes in a small area so that the surface as seen from the air looks pockmarked and there are no surface streams because all drainage occurs subsurface sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone carbonate rock salt beds or rocks that can naturally be dissolved by ground water circulating through them as the rock dissolves spaces and caverns develop underground sinkholes are dramatic because the land usually stays intact for a while until the underground spaces just get too big if there is not enough support for the land above the spaces then a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur karst topography karst topography is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite due to subterranean drainage there may be very limited surface water even to the absence of all rivers and lakes many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes or dolines being the most common however distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by glacial debris or confined by a superimposed nonsoluble rock strata some karst regions include thousands of caves even though evidence of caves that are big enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst karst landforms are generally the result of mildly acidic water acting on soluble bedrock such as limestone or dolostone the carbonic acid that causes these features is formed as rain passes through the atmosphere picking up co2 which dissolves in the water once the rain reaches the ground it may pass through soil that may provide further co2 to form a weak carbonic acid solution h2o + co2 = h2co3 recent studies of sulfates in karst waters suggests sulfuric and hydrosulfuric acids may also play an important role in karst formation this mildly acidic water begins to dissolve the surface and any fractures or bedding planes in the limestone bedrock over time these fractures enlarge as the bedrock continues to dissolve openings in the rock increase in size and an underground drainage system begins to develop allowing more water to pass through and accelerating the formation of underground karst features somewhat less common than this limestone karst is gypsum karst where the solubility of the mineral gypsum provides many similar structures to the dissolution and redeposition of calcium carbonate the karstification of a landscape may result in a variety of large or small scale features both on the surface and beneath on exposed surfaces small features may include flutes runnels clints and grikes collectively called karren or lapiez mediumsized surface features may include sinkholes or dolines closed basins vertical shafts foibe inverted funnel shaped sinkholes disappearing streams and reappearing springs largescale features may include limestone pavements poljes and blind valleys mature karst landscapes where more bedrock has been removed than remains may result in karst towers or haystackeggbox landscapes beneath the surface complex underground drainage systems such as karst aquifers and extensive caves and cavern systems may form classification of caves caves are classified a by the rocks they are in b by the morphology of the cave c by the time they were formed d by the way they were formed and e by the age of the rock 1 by the rocks they are in a limestone caves limestone dolomite marble b gypsum caves c lava caves 2 by the morphology of the cave the geometric structure a horizontal caves consist of some nearly horizontal tubes b fissure caves consist of a single fissure in the rock c vertical caves consist of shafts and short links in between d cave systems are rather large and contain many different features the discrimination in horizontal and vertical caves is useful only in areas with rather small caves these caves consist normally of a single tunnel or shaft in other karst areas with larger caves any cave is a cave system 3 by the time they were formed in relation to the forming of the rocks they are in a primary caves formed together with the surrounding rocks these are typically lava tubes or gas bubbles or tufa caves b most caves are secondary caves after the formation of the rock there is a time when part of the rocks are removed this secondary stage formed the cave c tertiary caves are the result of the collapse of other caves 4 by the way they were formed a solutional caves or karst caves most caves are in rocks which can be dissolved by a weak natural acid usually carbonic acid this acid forms when rainwater absorbs co2 from the air and the upper layers of the soil the forming of gypsum caves does not require co2 because gypsum has a very high solubility b lava caves or lava tubes first a crust hardens on a lava flow when the crust gets thick enough the lava flow is underground when the eruption ends the lava keeps flowing and the empty tunnellike passage remains the length of this tube depends on the distance from the lava source to the drain a depression or the sea it can be hundreds or even thousands of meters long c tufa caves are formed when limestone rich water emerges from a spring d sea caves are created by the erosion of waves the waves force water into cracks in the rock breaking the rock and forming caves often these caves follow less resistant rock layers e talus caves huge rockfalls from cliffs can create large spacious chambers within the resulting boulder piles f earthquake caves are formed by the movement of rock along a fault its just a natural crack in the rock and the big ones are very rare g glacier caves are created from water moving through glaciers these caves are formed inside the ice ice caves are filled with ice but the cave itself is formed in rock most ice caves are formed as solutional caves in limestone h soil tubes in desert areas flash floods can move through the soil and hollow out openings 5 by the age of the rock this is useful for limestone caves limestone is a sedimentary rock and is characterized by the time it was formed the most common limestone formations are a recent limestone or tufa is found all over the world b jurassic limestone c devonian limestone whisper rocks for hours and admission

in a cave in the neander valley of germany cromagnon man created his remarkable murals on the walls of caves in southern france and northern spain where he took refuge more than 1o000 years ago during the chill of the ice age interest in caves has not dwindled although firm figures for cave visitors are not available in 1974 about 15 million people toured mammoth cave in kentucky and more than 67o000 visited carlsbad caverns in new mexico two of the most famous caves in the united states types of caves a simple classification of caves includes four main types and several other relatively less important types solution caves are formed in carbonate and sulfate rocks such as limestone dolomite marble and gypsum by the action of slowly moving ground water that dissolves the rock to form tunnels irregular passages and even large caverns along joints and bedding planes most of the caves in the worldas well as the largestare of this type lava caves are tunnels or tubes in lava formed when the outer surface of a lava flow cools and hardens while the molten lava within continues to flow and eventually drains out through the newly formed tube sea caves are formed by the constant action of waves which attacks the weaker portions of rocks lining the shores of oceans and large lakes such caves testify to the enormous pressures exerted by waves and to the corrosive power of wavecarried sand and gravel glacier caves are formed by melt water which excavates drainage tunnels through the ice of entirely different origin and not to be included in the category of glacier caves are socalled ice caves which usually are either solution caves or lava caves within which ice forms and persists through all or most of the year in desert areas some shallow caves may be formed by the sandblasting effect of silt or fine sand being blown against a rock face these eolian caves some of which are spectacular in size are surpassed in number by caves of other origins in most deserts more common even in the driest deserts are sandstone caves eroded in part by water particularly if the sandstone is limy caves commonly known as wind caves such as the one in wind cave national park in south dakota are named not for the mode of origin of the cave but for the strong air currents that alternately blow in or out of the cave as the atmospheric pressure changes most wind caves are in fact solution caves how caves form the meltwater streams draining out along the floor of a glacier cave or the surging pounding waves at the mouth of a sea cave offer immediate evidence of the origin of these caves solution caves however have always been a source of wonder to man how do these extensive complex and in some places beautifully decorated passageways develop solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water they can be thought of as part of a huge subterranean plumbing system after a rain water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock and percolates beneath the land surface eventually some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water the term water table refers to the upper surface of this saturated zone calcite calcium carbonate the main mineral of limestone is barely soluble in pure water rainwater however absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation the water combining chemically with the carbon dioxide forms a weak carbonic acid solution this acid slowly dissolves calcite forms solution cavities and excavates passageways the resulting calcium bicarbonate solution is carried off in the underground drainage system it was once believed that caves formed near the earths surfaceabove the saturated zonewhere the water moved downward through the cracks and pore spaces this view however left many cave features unexplained why for instance are cave passages nearly horizontal in places crossing folded or tilted rock structures how would horizontal passages form at several different but persistent levels recent studies of the movement and chemistry of ground water have shown that the first stage in cave developmentthe dissolving of carbonate rocks and the formation of cavities and passagewaystakes place principally just below the water table in the zone of saturation where continuous mass movement of water occurs a second stage in cave development occurs after a lowering of the water table the water table normally sinks as the river valleys deepen during this stage the solution cavities are stranded in the unsaturated zone where air can enter this leads to the deposition of calcite which forms a wide variety of dripstone features the chemical process causing deposition of calcite is the reverse of the process of solution water in the unsaturated zone which dissolved some calcite as it trickled down through the limestone above the cave is still enriched with carbon dioxide when it reaches the ventilated cave the carbon dioxide gas escapes from the water just as it escapes from an opened bottle of soda pop the acidity of the water is thereby reduced the calcium bicarbonate cannot remain in solution and calcite is deposited as dripstone minerals found in caves many interesting minerals are found in caves in addition to the calcite which forms the major features aragonite a calcium carbonate mineral similar to calcite but not as common often occurs in intricate needles known as anthodites gypsum calcium sulfate and related calcium sulfate minerals are next to calcite in abundance some caves although they are developed in limestone have extensive passages lined with fine curling growths of gypsum flowers in other caves selenite a less common variety of gypsum forms long transparent rods or nests of fibrous crystals sulfates of sodium and magnesium are also found in caves although they are less conspicuous than gypsum iron minerals in the form of oxides limonite and hydroxide goethite occur in caves and in some places form stalactites manganese minerals in caves are commonly present as thin sooty coatings on walls and ceilings and in earth fills nitrocalcite calcium nitrate is abundant in earth fills in many caves but individual fragments are generally microscopic barite barium sulfate and celestite strontium sulfate also occur in earth fills in some solution caves clay minerals exist in relatively pure forms these include the less common varieties attapulgite and endellite in deep caves encountered during mining operations a number of ore minerals have been found in the decorative wall draperies most common are azurite and malachite forms of copper carbonate about 50 other minerals also have been reported in cave deposits uses of caves studies are underway in europe to extend the use of caves for domestic cold storage air conditioning and water supply purposes a large cave in southwestern virginia is used as a natural tunnel by the southern railway from the early 19th century through the civil war caves in kentucky tennessee virginia west virginia alabama georgia arkansas and missouri were important sources of nitrates an essential ingredient of gun powder surface or nearsurface accumulations of nitrate salts form coatings on rock walls fill cracks and crevices and mingle with cave earth the origin of the nitrate salts is not clearly understood but the salts are believed to result from the action of nitrifying bacteria on organic matter or humus although no accurate records of production were kept it has been estimated that over 15000 tons of niter earth producing 200 tons of potassium nitrate were removed from mammoth cave in kentucky between 1811 and 1814 caves have also been a source of bat guano a material mined as a phosphate fertilizer in the southern united states and mexico in general the largest deposits have occurred in limestone caves within the flight range of the mexican freetailed bat at the cache site you will see several caves these caves have been made by water and wind causing the limestone rock and dirt under the rock to

sedimentary rock created this cave system when an underground stream flowed through the rock the cave system is one of the most extensive systems found in ontario and exhibits depositional features including stalactites columns and flowstone history and geology of the rockwood area 410 million years ago rockwood was in the tropics the days were only 20 hours long because the world was spinning faster than today rockwood and most of southern ontario was covered by a tropical inland sea rockwood was located in a shallow part of the sea where there was a thriving coral reef the coral grew in pinnacles to the top of the water because it needed sunlight it would die back when the water level fell mollusks such as snails and clams lived in among the coral they are now extinct but are ancient relatives of todays edible shellfish over millions of years their shells piled up eventually becoming limestone cliffs that are up to 36 metres tall over 60 million years ago the continents started to collide gradually the super continent pangaea began to break apart a piece of pangaea called laurussia began to drift north during this change the earth moved volcanoes erupted and the landscape transformed the climate changed completely and became very cold 11000 to 16000 years ago was the peak of the ice age in the area instead of being covered by a tropical sea rockwood was covered by the wisconsin glacier that was a kilometre thick as it grew the great glacier worked like a bulldozer smashing everything in its way the glacier was so large it went from the rocky mountains to newfoundland 10000 years ago the moderate climate began finally free of its heavy load of ice the earths crust began to rebound this left bald limestone and water at rockwood as well as interesting rock formations that are visible today first lichens appeared on the land and algae on the water together they formed the first moss then ferns evolved followed by grasses wild flowers shrubs and eventually soft wood although the past thousands of years had the greatest impact of what we see today one can even go back much further to 420 425 million years ago were the area was part of the eramosa a member of the lockport formation or rock with gradational contacts with the goat island member area to the south and the guelph formation area immediately to the north these among other formations are also part of the lockport formation the rocks forming the eramosa are mostly dolomites but the composition varies from almost pure greyweathering fine grained dolomite to shaly bituminous brownweathing bioturbated dolomites fossils are common at some localities scarce at others and chert is generally a minor component the most characteristic feature is bituminous shaly interbeds probably the eramosa was deposited in several related environments most likely including shallow restricted and poorly oxygenated marine waters which we see signs of being present here today in the valley outside of this cave cave formation cave formation begins when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it falls through the atmosphere rain water must have carbon dioxide to become acidic it must be acidic to chemically react to the limestone bedrock rainwater is absorbed by the soil into the ground as rainwater comes through the soil it absorbs more carbon dioxide that is being produced by plants that are dead this changes the ground water to a weaker form of carbonic acid h2o + co2 = h2co3 as it travels down through the ground it comes to solid rock when the rock is limestone or dolomite caves can form the water reacts chemically with limestone and slowly a larger and larger space will form this happens because the rocks are made of calcium carbonate caco3 this is what you call chemical erosion as the space becomes larger and larger the water can flow through as it flows it erodes physical erosion washes away rock and sand this is what makes a cave larger and forms an underground stream finally over hundreds of thousands of years or even millions of years the cave is formed the above process of cave formation is how this particular cave has formed over time the opening to this cave is small and then opens up into a chamber then another small opening into a 2nd chamber examine the chambers walls and ceilings and look for cracks and evidence of where the water seeps in and erodes the rock around it feel the rock and see if its more soft and brittle than that of the smaller areas that you have to crawl through if you come here in the winter the opening may be blocked to some degree by ice stalactites formed by the water dripping down from within the opening of the cave and you may also notice water in the floor of the first chamber which you can observe the evidence that the water comes from both inside the caves dripping down though the cracks and also from outside of the cave that may flow inside during wet periods as the area outside of the cave is in a valley and there normally is a stream just a few meters from the cave opening resident cave man for 6 years during the 1980s there was a man who called this cave his home he had his fire just inside the door of the cave and the smoke from the fire would exit through a 1 inch hole that he made to the outside the ashes from his fire would fall down another hole which he made and then would be able to empty them the park eventually sent him his eviction notice cave access access to the cave is from a side trail that takes you to the backside of an impressive set of limestone cliffs follow the side trail to get access to the valley on the other side and then follow the base of the cliff to the cave opening which you will find at ground level it may be a bit muddy at times around the cave opening there are some pieces of wood and an old car tire lining the ground to the entrance of the cave it is a tight fit and you need to crawl in on your belly once inside you will encounter a chamber which you should be able to stand in then in another tunnel at the back right within this chamber that leads to a 2nd chamber again you will need to crawl on your belly through this tunnel to access the 2nd chamber in order to log this earthcache you will need to access both chambers in order to get the required information and make your observations tasks and logging requirements 1 with the use of a thermometer take the temperature at the outside of the cave within the 1st chamber and then within the 2nd chamber make sure you let the thermometer adjust long enough at each of

or openings how deep and how wide at the surface is the deepest crack or gap that you can find and is there evidence that water may flow through these cracks perhaps contributing one day to more tunnels and chambers being formed in this cave how do you think this cave or the surrounding area of limestone cliffs that houses this cave will be changed in 500 10000 100000 or even many millions of

geocache this earthcache will focus on the geological formation of this landmark introduction first of all thanks to tony and teresa for their permission to post this earthcache the cave spring is on private property but is visible from a public road so no trespassing is necessary to enjoy its beauty the property includes the spring an historic bunkhouse and a renovated log cabin please show your appreciation for the landowner allowing this earthcache to be placed by not passing the fence that plainly separates the private property from old cave spring road parking is available at the waypoints below this has become a very high traffic area so exercise caution when crossing roads cave formation all caves are not created equal in fact no two are exactly alike there are different kinds ice karst volcanic tubes sea caves and they are formed by many different processes chemical erosion wave action subsidence dissolution lava floes no one is able to accurately predict how long it takes a cave to form there are just too many variables and often these are unobservable since they are underground forces such as streams wind lava acid rain or ocean waves over time can carve out spaces large enough for us to walk in cave spring as the name connotes serves as the discharge point for an unseen underground river if you were to look around this area you would find the closest creek is on the opposite side of old cave spring road but its elevation is lower than the elevation of the cave spring so this creek cant be the source of the spring in fact the spring actually feeds this creek therefore the recharge zone of the spring must be underground invisible to us but how and why does it exit at the spring the appalachians the roanoke valley is located in a band of geology which spans the western third of the commonwealth called the blue ridge mountain province this physiographic province is part of the appalachian mountain range and extends from pennsylvania to georgia the blue ridge contains the highest mountains in eastern north america the three primary rock types in this province are limestone dolomite and shale there are few surface streams in the limestone valleys of the blue ridge province as runoff from mountain slopes disappears into the subsurface upon contact with the karst bedrock water then flows underground emerging at springs on the valley floor so what in the world does karst mean karst topography not all bedrock is solid karst is a german word derived from the slovenian kras which means bare stony ground it was originally used to describe a limestone plateau near trieste slovenia now the term means any landscape with distinctive landforms and hydrology shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone calcium carbonate caco3 or dolomite calcium magnesium carbonate camgco32 both of these rock types are slightly soluble in water karst terrain is characterized by springs caves sinkholes and aquifers that are highly productive but also vulnerable to contamination about 20 percent of the land surface in the us is classified as karst other parts of the world with large areas of karst include china europe the caribbean and australia in the united states about 40 of the ground water used for drinking comes from karst aquifers in western virginia karst terrain occurs along slopes and in valleys between mountain ridges virgina counties with karst topography some karst formations called speleothems can be the very dramatic stalactites stalagmites drapery straws and flowstone that are showcased in publicly accessible cavern systems along interstate 81 most caves are formed in limestone karst common speleothems the process rain can collect carbon dioxide as it falls to the earth forming a weak carbonic acid acid rain the addition of carbon dioxide greatly increases the solubility of the water once rain has been absorbed by the soil it picks up additional carbon dioxide from decaying organic matter and plants in this way the water passing through the soil and into the underlying rocks has the capacity to dissolve limestone and dolomite the ground water enters cracks and fractures in these layered rocks and begins to dissolve it when the water reaches an underlying layer of impenetrable rock the water moves sideways forming an underground river subterranean water follows difficult to predict paths bearing little relationship to surface topography depending on the acidity of the water and the path it takes through the rock a cave may form if it finds an exit from the rock this is called a spring most karst groundwater returns to the surface at springs near streams and rivers like this depending on the constancy of the water source rainfall or snowmelt that infiltrates the earth a spring may be ephemeral intermittent or perennial continuous cave spring cave spring is also a tributary of a creek this area has many springs that can be observed from public roads if this spring was in a depression or sink hole it might have formed a pool spring house with a pool but cave spring flows under the road into mud lick creek which in turn flows north into the roanoke river near the norwich neighborhood of roanoke city roanoke river eventually flows into albemarle sound and the outer banks of north carolina thats a journey of 400 miles and 1093 vertical feet for this spring water discharge from cave spring toward mud lick creek what youll see depends on the time of year you visit in the summer the view of the cave entrance is obscured by wisteria vines but is still partially visible spring is a beautiful time to visit as the landowner has accented the landscape around the entrance with various blooming flora if you visit the cache in december you may see a very special extraterrestrial visitor at the cave entrance who has appeared annually in recent years the inside scoop the water level in the cave only averages 165 deep it would have almost no depth if left to flow naturally across the impenetrable bedrock below but it has been modified by a manmade concrete dam across the cave entrance photos show this was in place as early as the 1960s and i theorize that the dam and the groove in the middle of it were installed to channel the water into a flume shape for easier bottling when the water is low it flows through an opening under this dam into a concrete channel crossing the lawn of the property to contain flooding the waters source in the earth keeps the water at a constant 55 degf all year long so it feels cold in the summer and warm in the winter springs including this one provided refrigeration for perishables in pioneer times immediately beyond the entrance that you can see the ashaped ceiling quickly diminishes at a steady slope on the left and by means of a large bouldershaped formation on the right the scallopedshaped patterns on the slopes of the ceiling surfaces

alike there are different kinds ice karst volcanic tubes sea caves and they are formed by many different processes chemical erosion wave action subsidence dissolution lava flows no one is able to accurately predict how long it takes a cave to form there are just too many variables and often these are unobservable since they are underground forces such as streams wind lava acid rain or ocean waves over time can carve out spaces large enough for us to walk in cave spring as the name connotes serves as the discharge point for an unseen underground river if you were to look around this area you would find the closest creek is near the campground but its elevation is lower than the elevation of the cave spring so this creek cannot be the source of the spring in fact the spring actually feeds this creek therefore the recharge zone of the spring must be underground invisible to us not all bedrock is solid karst is a german word derived from the slovenian kras which means bare stony ground it was originally used to describe a limestone plateau near trieste slovenia now the term means any landscape with distinctive landforms and hydrology shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone calcium carbonate caco3 or dolomite calcium magnesium carbonate camgco32 both of these rock types are slightly soluble in water karst terrain is characterized by springs caves sinkholes and aquifers that are highly productive but also vulnerable to contamination about 20 percent of the land surface in the us is classified as karst other parts of the world with large areas of karst include china europe the caribbean and australia in the united states about 40 of the ground water used for drinking comes from karst aquifers in western virginia karst terrain occurs along slopes and in valleys between mountain ridges for most areas in western virginia a fairly limited range of rock types is present one of the most important influences on a sedimentary rocks resistance to erosion is its quartz content the more quartz a rock contains the more resistant it will be to erosion in western virginia sandstones generally consist mostly of quartz siltstones and shales ie fine grained fg clastics are usually admixtures of quartz and other less resistant minerals limestones ie carbonates of course are composed of calcite which is rather susceptible to chemical weathering however some carbonate rocks do contain a fair amount of quartz especially in the form of chert and can be a bit more resistant to erosion than their more pure relatives in addition the carbonate rock dolomite is generally somewhat more resistant to erosion than limestone another equally important characteristic is how well the grains of a rock are consolidated known as its induration well indurated rocks have either intergrown crystals or the grains are joined together with a lot of intergranular cement most limestones are initially well indurated the induration of sandstones siltstones and shales ie clastics varies from outcrop to outcrop in addition over time weathering may dissolve the cement and weaken the rock quartz cements are very resistant to dissolution calcite cements dissolve rather readily iron oxides and clay minerals are fairly susceptible to chemical alteration as a result of these two factors composition and induration sedimentary rocks display a wide range of susceptibility to erosion generally wellindurated quartz sandstones are the most resistant to erosion likewise limestones and poorly indurated shales are the most susceptible to erosion other sedimentary rock types are a bit more difficult to place within this spectrum for example all else being equal a moderately indurated siltstone would probably be a bit less resistant to erosion than a moderately indurated conglomerate unless the siltstone has quartz cement and the conglomerate has calcite cement then the rates of resistance would be reversed rain can collect carbon dioxide as it falls to the earth forming a weak carbonic acid acid rain the addition of carbon dioxide greatly increases the solubility of the water once rain has been absorbed by the soil it picks up additional carbon dioxide from decaying organic matter and plants in this way the water passing through the soil and into the underlying rocks has the capacity to dissolve limestone and dolomite the ground water enters cracks and fractures in these layered rocks and begins to dissolve it when the water reaches an underlying layer of impenetrable rock the water moves sideways forming an underground river subterranean water follows difficult to predict paths bearing little relationship to surface topography depending on the acidity of the water and the path it takes through the rock a cave may form if it finds an exit from the rock this is called a spring most karst groundwater returns to the surface at springs near streams and rivers like this depending on the constancy of the water source there are three types of water flows ephemeral intermittent and perennial an ephemeral waterbody is a wetland spring stream river pond or lake that only exists for a short period following precipitation or snowmelt they are not the same as intermittent or seasonal waterbodies which exist for longer periods but not all year round to claim credit for the find

dangerous inside the cave is protected within cliff cave county park and can only be explored by permit from the st louis county department of parks and recreation how caves are formed caves are formed in many ways by far the most common way is by the dissolution of sedimentary rock by acidic water there are other forces that can create caves following are the descriptions of several solution caves by far the most common caves are solution caves these caves are formed through the interaction of air water soil and rock they usually form in areas where the dominant rock is limestone a type of sedimentary rock many solution caves feature streams and lakes and unusual mineral formations typically a cave like this forms over a period of several million years slump caves slumping in geological terms occurs when large sections of rock or a land mass moves its position away from or toward other sections of rock or land mass usually in the direction of a downslope the speed for this movement is typically very very slow however quick changes can occur especially with the occurrence of earthquake activity or frequent flooding slump caves can be formed when two large sections of rock move together and voids occur between the sections sea caves over time waves crashing against the base of a cliff can form a sea cave a sea cave forms along a vertical zone of weakness in the rock perhaps a crack or an area of softer rock the erosive power of the waves wear away the rock creating an opening that can deepen and expand with an overhang where the cliff rises above the waves sea caves are typically found in sedimentary rock such as sandstone and limestone they are less commonly formed in hard rock such as granite lava caves lava which is molten rock on the surface of the earth can create long intricate cave systems when lava flows it typically flows down a slope in a shape that resembles a long skinny tongue the tongue is a channel of flowing lava with the hotter fasterflowing lava in the center of the channel and the cooling lava closer to the edges of the channel the cooling lava on the edges solidifies forming walls and eventually a crust over the top of the lava flow when the eruption stops the remaining lava flows out of the voids and a tubelike cave remains additional lava flows can occur over the top of the cave burying the cave deeper and deeper bacteriaformed caves there are bacteria that thrive on oil deposits deep within the earth these bacteria which are named extremophiles because they thrive in extreme conditions expel a gas that combines with oxygen to create sulfuric acid this highly corrosive acid eats away at limestone leaving behind gypsum and creating the large voids of caves this bacterial process can feed upon itself with some of the bacteria eating the byproducts and other minerals accelerate the formation of caves manmade the word cave implies a feature created by natural forces therefore there really is no such thing as a manmade cave we have other words to describe the holes that humans have created in the earth humans have dug holes for many reasons including shelter passage mining disposal battle escape etc basic geology of cliff cave cliff cave is a solution cave it is formed from rock from the st louis limestone formation from the mississippian period the limestone rock is 362 to 320 million years old the cave was formed during the ice age and the best theories have the cave formation starting during either the yarmoth interglacial period 300000 to 600000 years ago or the aftonian interglacial period 700000 to 900000 years ago the current mapping of the cave from the missouri geological survey rolla defines the caves length as 4726 feet the cave has four separate entrances and contains many interesting geological formations inside such as a natural bridge falls domes tubes etc however the cave has very few typical ozark cave formations such as flowstone stalactites or stalagmites basic history of cliff cave the cave is believed to have been discovered and used by humans as early as 7850 bc the cave has a lot of native american history so much so that it is sometimes called indian cave the cave has history with the osage illini chickasaw and choctaw the osage and illini saw the cave as sacred likely because in winter months the cave emits a visible mist through its openings a sign to the people of the presence of the spirit being from 1830 to 1880 the cliff cave wine company used the cave to store and age wine the manmade brickwork and masonry that you see there was constructed by the wine company in the 1910s anheuserbusch stored beer in the cave in the 1920s the mob dumped bodies in the cave from the 1700s through just recently the cave has always periodically been the site for recreational activities crime and debauchery in 1993 a number of counselors and children were killed when during an exploration outing they were trapped in the cave by a flash flood in recent history there have been repeated occurrences of people becoming lost inside the cave basic ecology of cliff cave currently the cave stream is almost dead and supports only a few frogs and

swamp environment when plant debris dies and falls into the swamp the standing water of the swamp protects it from decay swamp waters are usually deficient in oxygen which would react with the plant debris and cause it to decay this lack of oxygen allows the plant debris to persist in addition insects and other organisms that might consume the plant debris on land do not survive well under water in an oxygen deficient environment pennsylvania particularly the appalachian plateau and allegheny mountain range was at one time a series of islands and swamps leading to the creation of a large amount of coal in the state before mining began there was an estimated 228 billion tons of bituminous and anthracite in pennsylvania as of 2001 12 billion tons still remain in the ground most of which is not economically feasible to mine american geologists recognized the importance of pennsylvanias coal region and named the upper carboniferous period the pennsylvanian period because of the abundance of coal in the state coal mining coal mining in pennsylvania helped fuel the industrial revolution in the united states in 1889 pennsylvania was americas number one coal producer that year alone more than 80000 tons of coal were mined statewide over the last two hundred years pennsylvania has produced more than onequarter of the nations total coal output the early steel and transportation industries relied heavily on local supplies of this valuable natural resource later coalburning power plants would supply much of the countrys electicity today coal still generates 40 of the worlds electric supply in pennsylvania 53 of all energy is currently produced from coal railroading railroading was the biggest business of the 19th century few industries affected the growth of america as significantly as the development of the ability to transport goods and people by rail with the completion of the horsehoe curve in 1854 and the transcontinental railroad in 1869 largescale expansion into the western united states became possible at this time the pennsylvania railroad company prr operated 7000 engines and 250000 cars making it one of the largest railroad companies in the nation the city of altoona was a major hub for the prr spur lines could now bring goods into the towns and export local resources to the mainline and ultimately the rest of the united states one such spur line was the bells gap railroad lloydsville the town of lloydsville played a crucial roal in the coal mining history of this region lloydsville is situated along the allegheny front where the lower alleghenies to our east meet with the higher peaks of the allegheny mountains to our west this area was home to numerous easily accessible seams of bituminous coal these seams were heavily minded to help fulfill americas energy needs during the industrial revolution the town of lloydsville prospered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for several reasons lloydsville possessed abundant coal and timber resources ans well as a strong determined workforce in 1872 lloydsvilles population was made up of almost 600 coal miners the pennsylvania railroad mainline was only 20 miles away in the town of bellwood when the bells gap railroad spur was built in the 1870s it connected the people and resources of lloydsville with the prr mainline and the rest of the nation watersheds and acid mine drainage what is a watershed a watershed is a region of land that drains to a common waterway any precipitation that falls in the area of this earthcache will drain into a stream called lloydsville run lloydsville run flows into bells gap run which in turn flows into the bellwood reservoir the altoona city authority treats water from the reservoir and distributes it to thousands of residents living in blair county bells gap run continues beyond the bellwood reservoir and eventually drains into the little juniata river which is a tributary of the juniata river which flows into the sesquehanna river the chesapeake bay and ultimately the atlantic ocean watersheds are important because human activities directly impact the quality of the water within them by protection local watersheds you are protecting both your drinking water supply and crucial aquatic ecosystems acid main drainage amd the unfortunate environmental legacy of hundreds of years of coal mining in pennsylvania includes approximately 2400 miles of polluted streams irresponsible coal mining has resulted in pennsylvanias number one source of water pollution acid mine drainage amd acid mine drainage forms when the mineral pyrite also known as fools gold which is often associated with seams of coal becomes exposed to the atmosphere air and water break down pyrite into sulfuric acid and iron compounds as groundwater carries this sulfuric acid through the mine spoil it dissolves and leaches out toxic metals the resulting main drainage can contain not only iron but also other metals such as aluminum and manganese this combination of metals and acid can have disastrous effects on the ecosystem of a receiving stream recognizing acid mine drainage there are many methods and techniques that can be used to determine if a steam is being affected by amd the most recognizable indicator is the color of the water and steam bed the most common colors associated with amd are red and orange and these colors will stain materials that they contact this staining is known as yellow boy and consists of iron that was once dissolved in the water as this iron oxidizes it coats rocks and cements the stream bed bottom amd that appears white or milky can idicate the presence of aluminum other ways to determine the presence of amd include testing the ph sulfates and metals in the water another method is to look at the amount of diversity of insect life in a stream this technique is and excellent method to gauge the health of the stream by examining the abundance and diversity of macro invertebrates with careful analysis this method can provide insight into the degree of degradation in some cases the united states environmental protection agency lists bells gap run as impaired by metals silt and low ph values cleaning up acid mine drainage when amd is present two of the most common methods to address the problem are active treatment and passive treatment however it can be quite difficult and expensive to remediate land and water resources that have been affected by amd nonpoint source pollution active treatment active treatment is the continuous addition of chemicals to waters polluted by abandoned mine drainage frequently used chemicals include limestone hydrated lime soda ash and caustic soda active treatment systems are used throughout the commonwealth and the generally perform quite will however there are several drawbacks to active treatment of amd first most systems require a reliable power source for operation also the purchase and delivery of chemicals can be costly the chemicals must then be mixed and aerated into the polluted waters to settle system maintenance as well as sludge removal from settling posds creates a financial burden for system operators finally onsite chemical storage is often a problem because many abandoned mine sites are in remote locations passive treatment a passive treatment system is a great way to use natures own chemical and biological processes to treat amd and improve water quality early research into amd led scientists to find that natural wetlands were capable of filtering and treating amd pollutants without significantly harming the wetland system unlike and active treatment system there is no continuous activity of a person of machine treating the amd thus operating and maintenance costs are significantly lower for passive systems several types of passive treatment systems have been implemented across the state such as open limestone channels diversion wells anoxic limestone

is the residual of the cave erosion and forms piles and dunes inside the huge cavern sand cave is a wind cave which means it is formed by winds destroying and sculpturing the sandstone sandstone is a very common sedimentary rock and perhaps the best known sedimentary rock it is formed in many environments the grains of sand are composed of individual crystals of various minerals such as quartz iron oxides manganese oxides and other impurities can cause bright and contrasting colors in sandstones these colors are what give sandstone its unique character and ornamental desirability the colors range from bright whites reds yellows oranges and even purples and greens colored sandstone is usually intricately banded in multiple colors which enhance its aesthetic appeal the sandstone deposits of sand cave are a beautiful part of the natural environment in the cave although sand cave is just a rock shelter there are various features of a true cave on hot summer days the inner parts stay cool the location has impressive acoustics voices echo off the sandstone walls decades ago churches used to hold singings at the site this was in prepark days when sand cave was accessible by road from the kentucky side sand cave is located in the cumberland mountain ridge north of ewing va this is one of several mountain ridges running from the east to the west what makes this ridge special is the fact that it is the border between kentucky and virginia and probably it is a bit higher than the other ridges the peaks are between 1000 and 1100m asl high route description route is a loop hike

why is there copper in the keweenaw peninsula a precambrian midcontinent rift formed around 11 billion years ago over the next 100 million years layers of volcanic and sedimentary rocks were deposited into the rift valley then hot water moved through the rocks filling the open pore spaces with native copper and other minerals geologist call this hydrothermal mineralization the copper is commonly found in the permeable layers of conglomerate between the sand and pebbles the keweenaw peninsula has two types of copper deposits lode deposits and fissure deposits the lode deposits comprise of conglomerate lodes rocks held together by copper and amygdaloidal lodes almondshaped deposits in the top layer of lava flows figure 2 bedrock geology map this map illustrates where copper conglomerates are located source <url> the fissure deposits are veins along fractures that parallel or cross the beds originally the delaware mine started as a fissure vein mine the ground was poor but there was enough copper to continue mining that site mining fissures was difficult for the miners to remove the large pieces of copper later miners started to mine conglomerate loads because the copper was easier to remove and more consistently found than in the fissure copper lodes the conglomerate loads could be mined more efficiently with the ore blasted out taken to the surface and then railroaded to stamp mills even though the conglomerates were rich in copper only about 2 of the ore rock hauled to the surface was copper the remaining rock was called poor rock and set in piles near the mine or hauled away and put to other uses another waste product of mining was stamp sand stamp sand is still a problem plaguing the keweenaw peninsula what are the properties of copper copper is an element and a mineral copper would appear red in color on a polished fresh surface and it would appear dull brown on a tarnished surface due to oxidation if you were to scrape copper on a streak plate the streak color would be red copper has a metallic luster copper is not a hard metal ranked 253 on mohs hardness scale copper could be scraped by a nail piece of metal or quartz however copper is hard enough that you will not be able to scrape it with your finger nail if you find copper in the rock pile it would most likely be irregularly shaped and less than three inches in size logging

what you see please use geological terms if possible olmsted cave is situated at the south end of a woodland that extends to highland road this woodland and the storm water management pond to the south are part of hamilton park owned by the city of hamilton it is not a part of the eramosa karst conservation area even though it contains many karst features the area surrounding olmsted cave has been developed and has negatively impacted this unique geographical feature olmsted cave is the second biggest cave in the karst region a number of other areas in ontario have single sinking streams and springs and some areas have two or even three sinking streams in close proximity what distinguishes the karst area is the large number of sinking streams and associated karst features as a result of urban development in 2000 one of the prominent sinking streams upper olmsted creek has been diverted into a storm sewer and no longer sinks in olmsted cave olmsted cave was probably the principal recharge point for olmsted spring recent urban development has redirected runoff in the former upper olmsted creek watershed to storm sewers and there is no longer any surface runoff sinking at olmsted cave although flow in the olmsted karst system has been greatly reduced as a result there is still some flow emerging from olmsted spring indicating that it still receives some diffuse recharge or possibly some allogenic recharge from other sinking streams olmsted cave is an important component of the olmsted karst it has a relatively large scenic entrance although the cave itself is not especially long the main entrance is a vertical shaft about 3 metres deep prior to recent construction upper olmsted creek sank in the entrance flowed across the floor of the cave and sank in breakdown slabs and silt covering the floor the flow from the former upper olmsted creek watershed is now directed into storm sewers if the capacity of the storm sewer and storm water management pond is ever exceeded then the overflow will drain into olmsted cave next to the main entrance of olmsted cave there is a long narrow slot that forms a karst window a karst window is a rockwalled depression usually with vertical walls with a stream flowing across its floor from one side to the other typically they are created by collapse of a bedrock roof into an underlying cave passage olmsted cave has about 30 metres of passage with a shaft entrance and a long skylight entrance developed along a prominent vertical joint the remaining two caves are small each drains an area of just a few hectares and the stream passages in the caves are correspondingly smaller in size being about 2030 centimetres in width and effectively impassable to humans there are several karst features situated in the woodland to the north of olmsted cave these are all contained within hamilton park a broad shallow valley extends from olmsted cave to highland road it is an excellent example of a dry valley about 30 metres to the north of olmsted cave a tiny stream sinks in an excellent solution shaft this shaft probably leads to the unexplored extension of olmsted cave and the various solution shafts may have acted as overflow sinks debris at the base of the shaft prevents further exploration further to the north there are a number of suffosion sinkholes developed along the dry valley prior to recent construction upper olmsted creek sank in olmsted cave and flowed in the subsurface for a distance of 380 metres to olmsted spring the unexplored cave or conduit is probably at a depth of 5 metres or more for most of its length an approximate minimum depth of this passage could be deduced by an accurate leveling survey at the cave and at the spring upper olmsted creek no longer exists water tracing with fluorescent dyes has confirmed that olmsted cave drains to olmsted spring the rapid tracer responses at the springs indicate that flow is through dissolutional caves or conduits olmsted spring is situated at the head of lower olmsted creek the spring and the creek are entirely contained with a park owned by the city of hamilton north of highland road this park is zoned as open space much of it is grassed and a paved footpath extends along its entire length the original spring has been completely buried by fill adjacent to or beneath highland road currently water emerges from the fill as well as from a small culvert during high flow the geomorphology of olmsted spring is entirely destroyed and restoration would be difficult or may even be impossible apparently the burial of the spring under fill has not had a significant impact on its hydrology since tracer tests indicate rapid groundwater velocities typical of karst lower olmsted creek extends from the spring for 150 metres before being directed into a storm sewer along its length there are at least three discrete sinkpoints where the stream loses water much of the creek is forested or undeveloped there is some minor fill and garbage at the sinkpoints and along the creek this has only had a minor impact on the geomorphology and hydrology of these karst features removing the garbage and fill would readily restore the sinkpoints as well as the creek the surface karst features in this area have been slightly to severely impacted by existing urban development and ongoing construction

have adapted to survival in the underground there are 24 known entries to limestone caves the best known of which is gap cave gap cave is located at the base of the pinnacle mountain in cumberland gap national historical park just beneath the cumberland gap the first doorway to the west several mountain ridges run along the borders of the three states virginia kentucky and tennessee cumberland gap is one of the lowest passes in the area and was the best possibility to cross the mountains for the treks of the early settlers on their way west did you know gap cave has also been called king solomons cave soldiers cave and cujos cave the cave was originally referred to as gap cave because of its proximity to the gap when early pioneers saw the cave they knew they were about to cross the mountains into the wilderness of kentucky throughout the years this cave had numerous names first it was named gap cave by dr thomas walker as it is located in cumberland gap later it was called soldiers cave and king solomons cave the name cumberland gap saltpetre cave recalls the time when salpetre for gun powder was mined in the cave as the book by trowbridge became popular it was dubbed gap cave but the present owner cumberland gap national historical park renamed the cave to gap cave its original name however it seems most people still know it as cujo cave cujo was a runaway slave who is said to have hid in the cave during the civil war the point with the legend is that cujo got killed by confederate soldiers inside the cave this is only 5km from the border to kentucky which was a neutral state and so would have been the rescue for cujo so the legend tells about failure in looking distance of the goal there is a book by john townsend trowbridge 18271916 called gap cave it was first printed in boston 1864 and is a historical novel about the civil war telling much of the story of this cave the cave is almost undeveloped although it is a show cave for a long time the former private owners cleaned the floors to allow a rather comfortable walk through the cave and built 183 steps for the steeper parts but still the floor is uneven in many points and sturdy shoes are much recomended the cave is not lighted lamps for the visitors are provided by the guides the geology of gap cave gap cave is a natural underground void large enough for a human to enter some geologists suggest that the term cave should only apply to cavities that have some part that does not receive daylight gap cave is an solutional cave formed in rock that is soluble such as limstone the largest and most abundant solutional caves in the usa are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes sinking streams and underground drainage gap cave is adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation these include flowstones stalactites stalagmites helectites draperies soda straws and columns these secondary mineral deposits in the cave are called speleothems all those stalactites a highlight of the trip is the talking stalactite or gurgling stalactite it is a rather common stalactite with one specialty it makes a strange sound like a tree frog or a chirping cricket the sound is produced by water probably a drop of water falling through a crack in the limestone ceiling as i stared through the dim lantern beams and viewed the spectacular stalagmites it made me realize how many years it took to create this natural artwork in the underground caverns of gap cave there are 75 foot pillars serving as an impressive wonder of natureit takes a stalagmite about 100 years to increase by an inch some stalactices represent 90000 years of growth a stalactite from the greek word for drip and meaning that which drips is a type of speleothem that hangs from the ceiling or wall of limestone caves it is a type of dripstone stalactites are formed by the deposition of calacium carbonate and other minerals which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions every stalactite begins with a single mineralladen drop of water when the drop falls it leaves behind the thinnest ring of calcite each subsequent drop that forms and falls deposits another calcite ring eventually these rings form a very narrow hollow tube commonly known as a soda straw stalactite soda straws can grow quite long but are very fragile if they become plugged by debris water begins flowing over the outside depositing more calcite and creating the more familiar coneshaped stalactite the same water drops that fall from the tip of a stalactite deposit more calcite on the floor below eventually resulting in a rounded or coneshaped stalagmite unlike stalactites stalagmites never start out as hollow soda straws given enough time these formations can meet and fuse to create columns with a fairly mild climate cumberland gap is a great place to visit any time of year summers can be hot and humid with temperatures commonly in the mid to upper 90s winters

outside the cave they entered and found him shortly afterwards it is said that when they found higgenbotham his hair had turned a snowy white from his ordeal geologic history of cardwell mountain for this earthcache you will learn some basics about cave development and the limestone in which this cave is formed if you do any traveling throughout tennessee you will notice that one region will appear very different from other regions this is because there are six distinct physiographic regions within the state you would pass through all six if you were to travel along i40 and i81 from memphis in the west to bristol in the east image courtesy of sherrie collie this earthcache is located on cardwell mountain this mountain where the cave entrance is found is an geologic outlier of the cumberland plateau physiographic region this means that the mountain was once connected to the main formation of the plateau but it eventually became an isolated segment due to erosion therefore cardwell mountain and its caves consist of the same rock strata type and age as the nearby plateau the following geologic map shows the classification of the rock strata that make up tennessee note in particular that most of middle tennessee consists of geological formations that were created during the paleozoic era from between 400 and 300 million years ago within the paleozoic era is the carboniferous period this period is referenced throughout the world by geologists except that it is further divided by american geologists into the mississippian early carboniferous and pennsylvanian late carboniferous periods courtesy of the tennessee division of geology mississippian and pennsylvania strata are easily distinguished the mississippian environment of north america was heavily marine with seas covering part of the continent as a result most of the mississippian rocks are sedimentary limestone which includes marine fossils such as crinoids which thrived in the seas the pennsylvanian environment alternated between terrestrial and marine due to the presence of extensive forests this resulted in the formation of coal deposits during the pennsylvanian period cave development long after the rock strata were laid down caves began to develop in limestone caves can be formed by 1 dissolution by a weak carbonic acid in groundwater 2 erosion and 3 breakdown collapses groundwater contains a weak carbonic acid that came about as rainwater picked up carbon dioxide when it passed through the atmosphere and soil layers when the the slightly acidic groundwater passes through fractures in limestone it dissolves the limestone slowly and enlarges any openings most limestone caves are created at or just below the water table the zone below the water table is called the phreatic zone large openings are created in this zone when the water contacts all surfaces of the rock and dissolves it quickly if the water in this zone is under pressure and flowing then erosion will take place simultaneously on all sides of a cave passage cave passages formed in the phreatic zone are typically circular or oval and will have very smooth rounded shapes slowmoving water in this zone can also form large scallops on all sides of the passage the zone above the water table is called the vadose zone because this zone contains air cave development in the vadose zone mainly occurs by erosion due to running water cave passage features of vadose development are fluted vertical shafts domepits trenches in the floor of passages and layered shelves on the walls smaller scallops if present are limited to the lower sections of the passage where water has been running quickly the passages may be dry or may include actively running streams and waterfalls note that a cave passage could be enlarged both above and below the water table over time so some cave passages can have both phreatic and vadose features a classic example is a keyhole passage photo courtesy of the river city grotto of the nss jacksonville florida the wellknown speleothems of stalactites and stalagmites are formed in the vadose zone when mineral deposits occur by groundwater dripping from

"693","GC1XQRB",35.51112,-80.34498,"Type.earthcache","typically gold mining in a region starts when someone discovers gold lying around on the ground or in a stream this was the case with the first gold find in north carolina in 1799 at what was to eventually become the reed gold mine in cabarrus county about 18 miles southwest of where you are standing in gold hill in 1823 dennis olmstead conducted a geological and mineralogical survey of the state of north carolina this was the first geological survey in the united states having to do with mineral deposits his survey focused heavily on the gold bearing rock in the region of gold hill shortly thereafter in 1824 gold was discovered in gold hill initially gold mining begins with the easy pickings placer mining placer pronounced plasser mining is possible because heavy particles have weathered out of previously solid rocks such weathered out particles are known as a deposit gold is very heavy it has a specific gravity of 193 meaning that it is 193 times heavier than water because they are so heavy these particles can be separated from lighter materials sand clay etc by running water or even air from a bellows in some cases besides placer deposits the other type of gold deposits is lode deposits and these are found imbedded in rock usually quartz as is the case at gold hill1 the unfortunate fact facing all placer miners is that easy pickings tend to be captured early once they were gone underground hard rock mining was the only alternative available to those early miners extensive mining began in 1842 and continued through the late 1850s and then stopped almost completely during the civil war period later new mining and oreprocessing techniques allowed mining to resume and continue sporadically into the early 1900s microscopic flakes of gold are widely distributed under the surface of much of the earth but are mostly in very tiny amounts geological faults fractures in rocks contraction and cracking in some types of rocks and other factors can combine to concentrate previously dispersed flakes to the extent that mining them becomes economically feasible1 at gold hill the gold particles were carried by hot liquids that filled cracks and fissures within the country rock heat and pressure drove off most of the water and other volatiles leaving behind veins of solid quartz those gold particles were now within hard solid quartz when placer mining think of a fellow with a shallow pan or bucket panning for gold was initially replaced by underground mining the latter form of mining was merely a bunch of pits dug into the earth actually such an open pit is a quarry not a mine besides making the area nightmarishly ugly it was also extremely hard work and the rewards were meager eventually the transition to truly underground mining took place such mining greatly increased the complexities of getting the ore out of the ground equipment materials experienced mining engineers and miners and most importantly lots and lots of money were all needed and all had to be in place before the first ounce of ore was mined so what would an underground mine at gold hill have looked like and what would its parts be called this is a schematic drawing of the randolph ore vein and the mine that was developed to extract that ore it is from the laney book of 1910 and was reproduced for us by the north carolina geological survey the randolph mine edit cross section of the randolph mine which was built to exploit a major vein of goldbearing ore hit the back arrow to return to the earthcache listing shaft a primary vertical or nonvertical opening through mine strata used for ventilation or drainage andor for hoisting of personnel or materials connects the surface with underground workings2 everything that enters miners supplies equipment or leaves miners ore country rock water a mine does so thru the shaft at large sophisticated mines there may have been more than one shaft with one for say miners and water pipes and another for rock and ore level at usually predetermined intervals a horizontal tunnel will depart from the shaft it is hoped that such a straight line tunnel will intersect a vein of orebearing material2 drift a horizontal passage underground a drift follows the vein as distinguished from a crosscut that intersects it or a level or gallery which may do either2 winze a secondary or tertiary vertical or nearvertical opening sunk from a point inside a mine for the purpose of connecting with a lower level or of exploring the ground for a limited depth below a level if miners were exploiting a vein using a drift and the vein went downward they would begin a winze in order to follow the vein2 whim a vertical horsepowered drum used as a hoist in a mine3 these were replaced by more sophisticated headframe gearing and winding arrangements when steampowered lifts were introduced headframe the aboveground whim or sophisticated lift and emptying hardware and structure over the shaft3 as mining became more productive and volumes of ore and rock increased dramatically the headframe or head house became a large imposing structure usually dominating the surrounding area stope an excavation in the form of steps made by the mining of ore from steeply inclined or vertical veins3 this is an old term and is not used today an area of worked over ore would be referred to as stoped on mine diagrams imagine a cavernous area underground where the ore has been completely extracted and sent to the surface for crushing mining difficulties it is well to remember the difficulties encountered by the mining companies as they attempted to get the ore mined and out of the ground water was a constant problem as ground water continuously seeped into the mine shaft and lower levels piping systems driven by stateoftheart steam powered pumps ran 24x7 in order to keep the mines relatively dry and safe shafts drifts stopes etc were all structurally different and went thru varying types of rock and ore miners and engineers had to know how each structure needed to be stabilized and made safe here is a beautiful illustration from laney that shows how technically and mechanically complicated the timber supports known correctly as cribbing had to be extensive cribbing in the randolph mine edit obviously a lot of knowledge and hard work had to take place for this degree of structure hit the back arrow to return to the earthcache listing the biggest challenge facing the engineers and miners was the sad fact that the gold at gold hill was not highly concentrated and they had to try and go after those orebearing bodies with the highest concentration of gold notes 1 there is no attempt herein to detail the geological

the loutre river in montgomery county graham cave state park provides opportunities for both recreation and education the main feature of the park graham cave was formed at the point of contact between jefferson city dolomite and st peter sandstone gradual water flowing through the sandstone along with a combined action of wind and freezing worked to make a relatively large cave the cave originally extended about 100 feet into the hill but an accumulation of debris over the years filled the lower part of the cave with about seven feet of deposits an archlike entrance 120 feet wide and 16 feet high provided human and animals with easy access to shelter graham cave is named after the first settler who owned the cave property in 1816 robert graham bought some bottomland along the loutre river from daniel boones son daniel morgan boone and in 1847 purchased the property that housed the cave it remained in the graham family until its transfer to the state in 1964 grahams son df graham used the cave to shelter his hogs but also became interested in archaeology and artifacts that he found in the cave after his death his son benjamin offered his fathers collection of artifacts to the university of missouri which spawned archaeological interest in professors jesse wrench and j brewton berry wrench and berry visited the cave to assess its archaeological potential in 1930 water trickles over a sandstone ledge into a small stream along one of the parks hiking trailsbenjamins daughter frances married ward darnell who in 1948 began to enlarge the shelter for his livestock archaeologists heard of darnells activity and persuaded him to stop until they could conduct salvage excavations between 1949 and 1955 the university of missouri and the missouri archaeological society conducted extensive excavations in the cave with astonishing results artifacts found in graham cave associated with charcoal dated by the radiocarbon method provided important evidence about mans adaptation to the environment at the end of the ice age archaeological findings revealed different periods in mans use of the cave dating back to as early as 10000 years ago archaeologists uncovered artifacts that provided clues to the lifestyle of the ancient dalton and archaic period native americans who first inhabited the cave artifacts revealed that these early native americans depended mainly on hunting and fishing for food using spears as weapons they occupied the cave seasonally and apparently believed in the supernatural a ring of rocks that encircle a large stone believed to be a council ring was found in the cave and suggests that they held ceremonies pieces of pottery found in the cave indicate that it was also occupied by a more recent culture of native americans as a result of these important archaeological findings graham cave was the first archaeological site in the united states to be designated a national historic landmark in 1961 frances graham darnell donated the cave and land to the state in 1964 to create a state park after acquisition of the cave by the state park system excavations were done in 1966 to clean up the area and provide additional research since then excavations have not been conducted in order to preserve the remaining deposits today an accessible trail leads to the entrance of the cave where interpretive signs

sequestering atmospheric carbon coal is a readily combustible black or brownishblack rock it is a sedimentary rock but the harder forms such as anthracite coal can be regarded as metamorphic rocks because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure it is composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen along with small quantities of other elements notably including sulfur it is the largest source of fuel for generation of electricity worldwide as well as the largest worldwide source of carbon dioxide emissions which according to the ipcc contribute to climate change and global warming in terms of carbon dioxide emissions coal is slightly ahead of petroleum and about double that of natural gas1 coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining either underground mining or open pit mining surface mining as geological processes apply pressure to dead biotic matter over time under suitable conditions it is transformed successively into peat considered to be a precursor of coal it has industrial importance as a fuel in some countries for example ireland and finland lignite also referred to as brown coal is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for steamelectric power generation jet is a compact form of lignite that is sometimes polished and has been used as an ornamental stone since the iron age subbituminous coal whose properties range from those of lignite to those of bituminous coal and are used primarily as fuel for steamelectric power generation additionally it is an important source of light aromatic hydrocarbons for the chemical synthesis industry bituminous coal a dense mineral black but sometimes dark brown often with welldefined bands of bright and dull material used primarily as fuel in steamelectric power generation with substantial quantities also used for heat and power applications in manufacturing and to make coke anthracite the highest rank a harder glossy black coal used primarily for residential and commercial space heating it may be divided further in to metamorphically altered bituminous coal and petrified oil as from the deposits in pennsylvania graphite technically the highest rank but difficult to ignite and is not so commonly used as fuel it is mostly used in pencils and when powdered as a lubricant openpit mining also known as opencast mining and opencut mining refers to a method of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow the term is used to differentiate this form of mining from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth openpit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rock are found near the surface that is where the overburden surface material covering the valuable deposit is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunneling as would be the case for sand cinder and gravel for minerals that occur deep below the surfacewhere the overburden is thick or the mineral occurs as veins in hard rock underground mining methods extract the valued material openpit mines that produce building materials are commonly referred to as quarries people in some englishspeaking countries are unlikely to make a distinction between an openpit mine and other types of opencast mines such as quarries borrows placers and strip mines openpit mines are typically enlarged until either the mineral resource is exhausted or an increasing ratio of overburden to ore makes further mining uneconomic when this occurs the exhausted mines are sometimes converted to landfills for disposal of solid wastes however some form of water control is usually required to keep the mine pit from becoming a lake after mining finishes the mine area must undergo rehabilitation waste dumps are contoured to flatten them out to further stabilise them if the ore contains sulfides it is usually covered with a layer of clay to prevent access of rain and oxygen from the air which can oxidise the sulfides to produce sulfuric acid a phenomenon known as acid mine drainage this is then generally covered with soil and vegetation is planted to help consolidate the material eventually this layer will erode but it is generally hoped that the rate of leaching or acid will be slowed by the cover such that the environment can handle the load of acid and associated heavy metals there are no long term studies on the success of these covers due to the relatively short time in which large scale open pit mining has existed it may take hundreds to thousands of years for some waste dumps to become acid neutral and stop leaching to the environment the dumps are usually fenced off to prevent livestock denuding them of vegetation the open pit is then surrounded with a fence to prevent access and it generally eventually fills up with ground water in arid areas it may not fill due to the deep groundwater levels this area or place that you will be looking at is where

toothpaste is a colour additive for drugs and cosmetics is used to create casts and is used as a soil additive to improve the soils workability give up the answer is hydrous calcium sulphate commonly known as gypsum gypsum is a common sedimentary rock it is very soft one of the predominant traits of this rock family due to its softness it has little value as a building material however humans use this stone for everything from fertilizer to plastics because of its other useful properties one of the major characteristics of gypsum is its softness on the mohs hardness scale gypsum only earns a 2 rating in fact the word gypsum comes from the greek word for chalk when it becomes dehydrated its softness allows the mineral to easily crumble into a chalklike substance for this reason gypsum often was used for sculptures as long ago as ancient egypt in modern times gypsum forms the basis of sculpting materials like plaster of paris gypsum mainly occurs as a crystal in nature these crystals grow either in long fibers or large masses some of the fibers grow to great lengths especially in arid conditions creating crystalline shapes up to 39 feet long most gypsum is transparent but a prized variety has a slightly white shade this is alabaster a stone used for artistic purposes alabaster occurs in many types of artwork from small ornamental boxes to great sculptures gypsum primarily is made up of sulfur this is due to the evaporative process that creates the mineral by the start of the 19th century farmers realized that adding sulfur to the soil helped plants to grow therefore many used crumbled gypsum as a natural fertilizer in fact american farmers became so desperate to get this fertilizer that it led to a smuggling trade with nova scotia which caused the war of 1812 modern fertilizers still use gypsum and it is still an ingredient for many types of plaster there are multiple gypsum mines all over the world due to the demand of this mineral by modern industry while gypsum has a practical purpose it is also quite lovely in its natural form many rock collectors preserve gypsum crystals simply for the beauty of the stone geology history of gypsum in the area provided by the grand river heritage mines society from rest acres road the land slopes down to the east and south to the grand river and whitemans creek during and after the ice age several shoreline levels were formed as the waters receded and the water levels changed as a result terraces and steep slopes were formed which lead to the flat flood plains the upper levels are composed of flat fields welldrained because of the deep deposits of sand and gravel left by the glaciers and melting streams during the retreat of the last glacier the wisconsin extensive lowland areas were submerged in glacial lakes this is where the sand and clay plains of brant county were formed the gypsum mines were located where the bedrock was exposed in the valleys of the rivers as shown in this diagram as the glaciers retreated and the climate warmed plants and animals appeared moving up from the south gypsum was exploited in our area by the early settlers there were several mines and mills located in the paris area at first early settlers used picks and shovels to dig it out of the banks along the grand and nith rivers there in the valley where the bedrock was exposed pioneers who settled along the river found deposits of the whitish rock they dug shallow canals beside the river for water power and built mills beside them to grind the grain they grew to make grist and flour and land plaster other settlers opened their own mines or leased their mining rights to businessmen who had the land plaster hauled to the mills to be ground and sold to area fanners neighbouring settlers bought gypsum from them to use as a soil conditioner and fertilizer they used gypsum to plaster their interior walls and to stucco their homes exteriors other uses of gypsum were discovered later on the torrance mine the torrance mine is the only intact mine in the paris area today and it was first prospected in 1846 in the bureau of mines report of 1895 and 1896 it is written on lot 16 in the first concession of the township of brantford one mile east of paris on the north side of the grand river a new opening for plaster was being made the property comprising 133 acres is owned by mr john torrance of paris and occupied by mr william hynes as tenant who is an old miner who in company with james wright another miner had driven a shaft from the brink of the river north 45 feet at the date of my visit november 27th limited prospecting had been done at the place of opening some 50 years ago but the work was abandoned and nothing further done until the present year along the drift some excellent specimens of plaster were obtained intermingled with slate the extremity of the drift was in clay it was the intention i was told to advance the work much farther in the same line with the

is a $2 parking fee for more information please call 5182968900 scientists believe nature began to slowly craft howe caverns about six million years ago long before the ancient extinct animal known as the woolly mammoth appeared on earth the caverns are unique for more than their age and beauty they are among a very small number of mineral caves in the world the walls of howe caverns consist of two types of limestone coeymans and manlius limestone from different periods in the earths early history as well as a rock known as rondout waterred the manlius limestone is seen most clearly and is the most abundant while coeymans limestone can be seen in the upper portion of the cave near the entrance coeymans limestone is more difficult to dissolve than the manlius variety so the water naturally chose a lower path through the manlius layer as a result almost perfectly flat ceilings can be seen in parts of the cavern which are actually the underside of the coeymans limestone layer rondout waterred is the creamcolored rock that runs along the underground stream scientists believe all of these rock layers were laid down by the ancient extinct sea during the silurian and devonian periods of our earths formation they are all sedimentary rock formed by layers of deposits that settled out of a body of water which then were compressed into solid rock to give you an idea of the age of these rocks scientists estimate the silurian age began about 435 million years ago and ended when the devonian age began around 395 million years ago while there are a few fossils visible in the cavern walls the main fossil beds lie in the layers of limestone above the cavern ceiling this means the rock from which howe caverns is carved is older than most fossils but the building process in howe caverns is never done nature is still hard at work in the great cave proven by the fact we still hear see and feel the droplets of water falling from the walls and ceilings always changing the caverns face it changes so slowly that the smudges left by smoking torches nearly a century ago can still be seen on the glowing flowstone walls today stalactites stalagmites and flowstone once the ancient subterranean stream cut its path through the limestone layers marvelous formations called stalactites stalagmites and flowstone began to form these unique stone formations grow at an unbelievably slow rate only about one cubic inch about the size of a small ring box will form in 100 years when rainwater seeps down through the soil above it picks up a very very small amount of limestone as it travels in fact there is only about a teaspoon of limestone dissolved in every gallon of rainwater that filters through the surface above the caverns as this rainwater drips slowly through the caves roof the droplets of water evaporate leaving behind tiny amounts of limestone on the cavern ceiling in this way stalactites grow downward from the vaulted cavern roof particle by particle over the course of millions of years the stone formations which grow up from the cavern floor are created in the same manner sometimes large droplets of water filtering through the cave roof do not have time to evaporate before they roll down a stalactite and drip off to the cave floor below thats why stalagmites usually form directly below stalactites and continue to grow up and up as more droplets fall from above in some cases such as the grand pipe organ formation at howe caverns stalactites and stalagmites will actually grow together to form columns by the way its easy to remember the difference between stalactites and stalagmites the word stalactites contains the letter c like the word ceiling stalagmite uses the letter g and so does the word ground stalactites grow from cavern ceilings while stalagmites grow upward from the ground flowstone is formed in much the same way as stalactites and stalagmites except the water flows down the cavern walls this wonderful rock formation resembles sheets of frozen rippling ice other minerals in the water that carry the limestone give flowstone stalactites and stalagmites their colors with the exception of the colors created by lights in the cavern all of the colors you see at howe caverns are completely natural rustcolored formations are caused by the presence of iron in the dripping water green is from waterborne copper gray indicates the presence of aluminum oxide yellow and bronze are from dissolved sulphur pure calcite makes milky translucent white formations to log this earth cache you must post

carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite subterranean drainage may limit surface water with few to no rivers or lakes many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes being the most common however distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by glacial debris or confined by one or more superimposed nonsoluble rock strata some karst regions include thousands of caves although evidence of caves large enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst types and formation a cave or cavern is a hollow place in the ground especially natural underground space large enough for a human to enter caves form naturally by the weathering of rock and often extend deep underground solution caves solutional caves are the most frequently occurring caves and such caves form in rock that is soluble such as limestone but can also form in other rocks including chalk dolomite marble salt and gypsum rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through beddingplanes faults joints and so on over geological epochs cracks expand to become caves and cave systems primary caves caves formed at the same time as the surrounding rock are called primary caves lava tubes are formed through volcanic activity and are the most common primary caves as lava flows downhill its surface cools and solidifies hot liquid lava continues to flow under that crust and if most of it flows out a hollow tube remains examples of such caves can be found in the canary islands jejudo the basaltic plains of eastern idaho and other places kazumura cave near hilo hawaii is a remarkably long and deep lava tube it is 656 km long 408 mi how caves form cave formation begins when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it falls through the atmosphere rain water must have carbon dioxide to become acidic it must be acidic to chemically react to the limestone bedrock rainwater is absorbed by the soil into the ground as rainwater comes through the soil it absorbs more carbon dioxide that is being produced by plants that are dead this changes the ground water to a weaker form of carbonic acid h2o + co2 = h2co3 as it travels down through the ground it comes to solid rock when the rock is limestone or dolomite caves can form the water reacts chemically with limestone and slowly a larger and larger space will form this happens because the rocks are made of calcium carbonate caco3 this is what you call chemical erosion as the space becomes larger and larger the water can flow through as it flows it erodes physical erosion washes away rock and sand this is what makes a cave larger and forms an underground stream finally over hundreds of thousands of years or even millions of years the cave is formed rocks elements minerals and crystals rocks go through cycles types of rocks sedimentary sedimentary rocks are formed by sediment that is deposited over time usually as layers at the bottom of lakes and oceans this sediment can include minerals small pieces of plants and other organic matter the sediment is compressed over a long period of time before consolidating into solid layers of rock sedimentary rocks form layers called strata which can often be seen in exposed cliffs sedimentary rocks cover the majority of the earths rocky surface but only make up a small percentage of the earths crust compared to metamorphic and igneous types of rocks some examples of sedimentary rocks include limestone sandstone mudstone greywacke chalk coal claystone and flint limestone forms the metamorphic rock marble when subjected to extreme heat and pressure over time metamorphism sandstone forms the metamorphic rock quartzite mudstone forms the metamorphic rock slate chalk is a soft white form of limestone flint is a hard sedimentary form of the mineral quartz chert is a finegrained silicarich microcrystalline cryptocrystalline or microfibrous sedimentary rock that may contain small fossils it varies greatly in color from white to black but most often manifests as gray brown grayish brown and light green to rusty red its color is an expression of trace elements present in

the gaspesie where you will find some of the higher moutains of this region those moutains are part of of a much bigger chain of moutains the appalachians the gaspesie was formed at the cambrien era 500 millions years ago and the devonian 400 millions years ago at the beginning the landmass is located in the south tropic in a supercontinent called rodinia there is an gigantic sea at its center the laptetus sea witch goes from the labrador to the golf of mexico a the end of the devonian the lapetus sea will contract under the mouvement of the continent by the end of the mesozoic era the appalachian mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain it was not until the region was uplifted during the cenozoic era that the distinctive topography of the present formed the birth of the appalachian mountain and other like them maybe explain by the mouvement of tectonic plates when the two plates collide the force witch they push against each other and the pressure building may cause the plates to move on top of each other in this case the part of the plate that rise will be the birth of a moutain rangeit took 150 millions of years to have what we can see of the appalachian moutains now as mention before the appalchalians were the results of a collision between two ancient continent the laurentia and the baltica the gaspesian part of the appalachian were born when the ancien oceanic floor and sedements that was accumating for millions of years rises from this plate collision the natural mountain building is called orogeny in this case the appalachian orogeny most copper produced is extracted from sulfide deposits copper copper is a ductile metal with great electric or heat conductivity pure copper is rather soft and flexible and a freshlyexposed surface has a

mineral its chemical structure slightly modified when the magma rise to the surface it get cooler then solidified igneous rocks between differents layers of rocks at different levels beneath the surface of the earth crust those igneous rocks can be intrusive or extrusive the rock is extrusive when the flow of magma reach the surface of the earth or the bottom of the ocean magma hardened at the surface the process is to be intrusive when the magma solidified under the earths surface or under the oceanic floor in general the grain of an extrusive rock will be much fine then the one of an

surface of the moutain see pic below the silica flux bind with the iron and other impurities and keeps them separate from the copper liquid copper and iron fall to the bottom of the furnace while the sulfur combine with oxigen to form sulfur dioxide gas the copper iron and silica form two layers at the bottom of the furnace the lighter top layer is a slag mostly ironsilica and other impurities in front of the interpretation center the is a small river look in each side of the river you will see small piece of slag its a dark brown color the bottom layer of mostly copper and some iron is called matte sulfur dioxide acid gas from the furnace is captured and mix with water in an adjacent acid plant to produce sulfuric acidlook to the rear of the interpretation center you can see the pipeline black pipe that was transporting the acid from the plant to the reservoir the converter furnace in the converter air is blown into the matte to burn away the iron and any remaining sulfur the result is called blister copper the anode furnace the blister in more 98 pure copper but contain too much oxygenthe anode furnace blows natural gas into the melt to burn off the oxygen copper is then poor

solve the puzzle to find the exact location of the cache the lost dutchman gold mine also known by many similar names is reportedly a very rich gold mine hidden in the superstition mountains near apache junction east of phoenix arizona in the united states the land is a designated wilderness area and mining is now restricted there by title 16 chapter 23 paragraph 1133 of the united states code the mine is named after german immigrant jacob waltz dutchman was a common though inaccurate american slang term for german derived from the german word for german deutsch it is perhaps the most famous lost mine in american history arizona placename expert byrd granger notes that as of 1977 the lost dutchman story was printed or cited at least six times more often than two other fairly wellknown tales the story of captain kidds lost treasure and the story of the lost pegleg mine in california robert blair notes that people have been seeking the lost dutchman mine since at least 1892 while granger writes that according to one estimate 8000 people annually made some effort to locate the lost dutchmans mine former arizona attorney general bob corbin is among those who have looked for the mine others have argued the mine has little or no basis in fact and is a legend though as noted below blair argues that all the main components of the story have at least some basis in fact according to many versions of the tale the mine is either cursed or protected by enigmatic guardians who wish to keep the mines location a secret other lost dutchman mines blair writes that there have been at least four legendary lost dutchman gold mines in the american west including the famed superstition mine of jacob waltz one lost dutchman mine is said to be in colorado another in california two are said to be located in arizona tales of these other lost dutchman mines can be traced to at least the 1870s the earliest lost dutchman mine in arizona was said to have been near wickenburg about 180 km 110 mi northwest of the superstition mountains a dutchman was allegedly discovered dead in the desert near wickenburg in the 1870s alongside saddlebags filled with gold blair suggests that fragments of this legend have perhaps become attached to the mythical mine of jacob waltz what would seem to be a crucial detail is also in dispute as some allege that the socalled mine is actually a mine in the superstition mountains or is instead a hidden stockpile of gold ore andor bullion andor coins stories about the mine granger writes that fact and fiction blend in the tales but that there are three main elements to the story they are first tales of the lost apache gold or dr thornes mine second tales about the lost dutchman and third stories of the soldiers lost gold vein the most complete version of the lost dutchman story incorporates all three legends as noted below blair argues that there are kernels of truth at the heart of each of these three main stories though the popular story is often badly garbled from the actual account in 1977 granger identified 62 variants of the lost dutchman story some of the variations are minor but others are substantial casting the story in a very different light from the other versions keeping in mind that there are sometimes considerable variance between the tales below is a brief summary of each of the three stories identified by granger lost apache gold or dr thornes story in this story actually two interconnected stories members of the apache tribe are said to have a very rich gold mine located in the superstition mountains famed apache geronimo is sometimes mentioned in relation to this story in most variants of the story the family of a man called miguel peralta discovered the mine and began mining the gold there only to be attacked or massacred by apaches in about 1850 in the supposed peralta massacre years later a man called dr thorne treats an ailing or wounded apache often alleged to be a chieftain and is rewarded with a trip to a rich gold mine he is blindfolded and taken there by a circuitous route and is allowed to take as much gold ore as he can carry before again being escorted blindfolded from the site by the apaches thorne is said to be either unwilling or unable to relocate the mine the truth about the peralta mine blair insists that the peralta portion of the story is unreliable writing the operation of a gold mine in the superstitions by a peralta family is a contrivance of 20th century writers a man named miguel peralta and his family did in fact operate a successful mine in the 1860s but near valanciana california not in arizona the mine was quite profitable earning about $35000 in less than one year blair describes this as an unusually good return for such a small gold mine to earn in such a relatively brief period as of 1975 ruins of the peralta mine were standing however the peralta mine eventually became unprofitable and after the money was gone miguel peralta eventually turned to fraud dr george m willing jr paid peralta $20000 for the mining rights for an enormous swath of land about 3000000 acres 12000 km2 in southern arizona and new mexico based on a deed originally granted by the spanish empire in the 18th century trouble came after willing learned that the deed was entirely bogus despite his efforts willing was never able to recover the money he gave to peralta these deeds led to the basis of the james reavis arizona land swindle blair argues that this peralta story well known to arizona residents was eventually incorporated in the lost dutchman story in a severely distorted version following the renewed interest in the lost dutchmans mine in the 1930s the truth about dr thorne another detail which casts doubt on the story is the fact that according to blair there was never any dr thorne in the employ of the army or indeed of the federal government in the 1860s according to blair the origin of this story can be traced to a doctor named thorne who was in private practice in new mexico in the 1860s thorne claimed that he was taken captive by navajos in 1854 and that during his captivity he had discovered a rich gold vein thorne related his claims to three us soldiers in about 1858 the three soldiers set out to find the gold but without success over the decades this true tale was gradually absorbed into the lost dutchmans story the lost dutchmans story this tale involves two german men jacob waltz or weitz weitzer walls welz walz et cetera and jacob weiser however blair argues that there is a strong likelihood that there never was a second man named weiser but rather that a single person named waltz or a variant thereof was over the years turned into two men as the legend of the dutchman mine evolved blair contends that this story can be divided into hawk and dove versions depending on if the germans are said to behave violently or peacefully in most versions of the tale waltz andor weiser located a rich gold mine in the superstition mountains in many versions of the story they save or aid a member of the peralta family and are rewarded by being told the location of the mine weiser is attacked and wounded whether by marauding apaches or by a greedy waltz but survives at least long enough to tell a man called dr walker about the mine waltz is also said to make a deathbed confession to julia thomas and draws or describes a crude map to the gold mine see historical jacob waltz below for more information about the miner whose deathbed confession was the beginning of the legend of the lost dutchman mine stories of the soldiers lost gold vein in yet another version of the tale two or more us army soldiers are said to have discovered a vein of almost pure gold in or near the superstition mountains the soldiers are alleged to have presented some of the gold but to have been killed or to have vanished soon after this account is usually dated to about 1870 according to blair the story may have its roots in the efforts of three us soldiers to locate gold in an area of new mexico based on an allegedly true story related to them by dr thorne of new mexico see above the historical jacob waltz a view of superstition mountains in lost dutchman state park blair cites ample evidence of the historical jacob waltz and suggests that there is additional evidence that supports the core elements of the story as related above that waltz did in fact claim to have discovered or at least heard the story of a rich gold vein or cache but blair suggests that this core story was distorted in subsequent retellings comparing the many variants of the lost dutchmans story to the game of chinese whispers where the original account is distorted in multiple retellings of the tale there was indeed a jacob waltz who immigrated to the us from germany the earliest documentation of him in the us is an 1848 affidavit in which waltz declared himself to be about 38 years old a man called jacob walz was born in september 1810 in wurttemberg blair suggests that this waltz could be the same waltz who later came to be regarded as the legendary dutchman and that he changed the spelling of his surname to better match its pronunciation waltz relocated to arizona in the 1860s and stayed in the state for most of the rest of his life he pursued mining and prospecting but seems to have had little luck with either in 1870 waltz had a homestead of about 160 acres 065 km2 near phoenix where he operated a farm there was a catastrophic flooding in phoenix in 1891 and waltzs farm was one of many that were devastated afterwards waltz fell ill he was rumored to have contracted pneumonia during the flooding he died on october 25 1891 after having been nursed by an acquaintance named julia thomas she was usually described as a quadroon blair suggests that there is little doubt that waltz did in fact relate to thomas the location of an alleged gold mine as early as september 1 1892 the arizona enterprise was reporting on the efforts of thomas and several others to locate the lost mine whose location was told to her by waltz after this was unsuccessful thomas and her partners were reported to be selling maps to the mine for $7 each the death of adolph ruth were it not for the death of amateur explorer and treasure hunter adolph ruth the story of the lost dutchmans mine would have likely been little more than a footnote in arizona history as one of hundreds of lost mines rumored to be in the american west ruth disappeared while searching for the mine in the summer of 1931 his skull with two bullet holes in it was recovered about half a year after he vanished and the story made national news thus sparking widespread interest in the lost dutchmans mine in a story that echoes some of the earlier tales ruths son erwin c ruth was said to have learned of the peralta mine from a man called pedro gonzales or gonzalez according to the story in about 1912 erwin c ruth gave some legal aid to gonzales saving him from almost certain imprisonment in gratitude gonzales told erwin about the peralta mine in the superstition mountains even reportedly passing on some antique maps of the site gonzales claimed to be descended from the peralta family on his mothers side erwin passed the information to his father adolph who had a longstanding interest in lost mines and amateur exploration in fact the elder ruth had fallen and badly broken several bones while seeking the lost pegleg mine in california he had metal pins in his leg and used a cane to help him walk in june 1931 ruth decided to finally try and locate the lost peralta mine after traveling to the region ruth stayed several days at the ranch of tex barkely and prepared for his expedition barkely repeatedly urged ruth to abandon his search for the mine the treacherous terrain of the superstition mountains could be difficult for experienced outdoorsmen let alone for the semilame 66yearold ruth however ruth ignored barkelys advice and set out for a two week stint in the mountains ruth did not return as scheduled and no trace of him could be found after a brief search in december 1931 the arizona republic reported on the recent discovery of a human skull in the superstition mountains to determine if the skull was ruths it was examined by dr alea hrdlicka a wellrespected anthropologist who was also given several photos of ruth along with ruths dental records as curt gentry writes dr hrdlicka positively identified the skull as that of adolph ruth he further stated after examining the two holes in the skull that it appeared that a shotgun or highpowered rifle had been fired through the head at almost pointblank range making the small hole when the bullet entered and the large hole when it exited in january 1932 human remains were discovered about threequarters of a mile 121 km from where the skull had been found though the remains had been scattered by scavengers they were undoubtedly ruths many of ruths personal effects were found at the scene including a pistol not missing any shells and the metal pins used to mend his broken bones but the map to the peralta mine was said to be missing tantalizingly ruths checkbook was also recovered and proved to contain a note written by ruth wherein he claimed to have discovered the mine and gave detailed directions ruth ended his note with the phrase veni vidi vici authorities in arizona did not convene a criminal inquest regarding ruths death they argued that ruth had likely succumbed to thirst or heart disease though as gentry writes one official went so far as to suggest that adolph ruth might have committed suicide while this theory did not ignore the two holes in the skull it did fail to explain how ruth had managed to remove and bury the empty shell then reload his gun after shooting himself through the head blair notes that the conclusion of arizona authorities was rejected by many including ruths family and also by those who held onto the more romantic murderedforthemap story blair writes that the national wire services picked up the story of ruths death and ran it for more than it was worth possibly seeing the mysterious story as a welcome reprieve from the bleak news that was otherwise typical of the great depression other deaths and disappearances since ruths death there have been several other allegedly mysterious deaths or encounters in the superstition mountains but its unclear how many of these can be regarded as reliably reported in the mid1940s the headless remains of prospector james a cravey were reportedly discovered in the superstition mountains hed allegedly disappeared after setting out to find the lost dutchmans mine in his 1945 book about the lost dutchmans mine barry storm claimed to have narrowly escaped from a mysterious sniper he dubbed mr x storm further speculated that adolph ruth might have been a victim of the same sniper on july 11 2010 curtis meriworth 67 ardean charles 62 and malcolm meeks 60 went missing in the superstition mountains looking for the mine one of the men became lost in the same area in 2009 and had to be rescued on july 19 the maricopa county sheriffs department called off the search for the lost men they presumably died in the summer heat state park in 1977 12 acres abutting the

underground boat tour for a fee karst is a distinctive topography in which the landscape is shaped by the dissolution of carbonate bedrock this bedrock is often limestone or dolomite at lost river cave and valley this bedrock is limestone over many thousands of years the carbonic acid which causes this dissolution is formed as rain passes through the atmosphere picking up carbon dioxide when it reaches ground level the water may pick up more carbon dioxide from the soil to form a weak carbonic acid solution this acidic solution runs in any cracks or crevices in the rock as the water runs underground with a continuous supply of acidic water openings in the bedrock increase in size and an underground drainage system begins to develop this in turn allows more water to pass through the cycle accelerates the formation of karst this process creates unusual features both above and below the land surface sinkholes vertical shafts blue holes disappearing streams springs complex underground drainage systems and caves are formed by this geological process caves or caverns that are large enough for exploration are not a required characteristic of a karst area we begin with sources of water at lost river cave and valley it is estimated that around 25 of the worlds population gets its water from karst aquifers in the united states approximately 40 of the groundwater used for drinking comes from these karst aquifers a spring is any natural occurrence where the groundwater aquifer intersects the surface emergence of the groundwater at this point to the surface results in a surface stream sinking streams lose part or all of their flow to the groundwater system by disappearing underground there are three types of spring outlets first is a filtration or seepage spring the term seep refers to springs with small flow rates in which the source water has filtered into permeable earth the second is fracture springs which re discharged from faults or fissures in the earth in this case the springs follow a natural course of weaknesses in the bedrock the third type is tubular springs which come from waterdissolved underground channels or cave systems minerals from the underground rocks can become dissolved into the groundwater this may give the water flavor and even carbon dioxide bubbles depending on the nature of the rocks that it passes through this is why spring water is often bottled and sold as mineral water springs that contain large amounts of dissolved sodium salts like sodium carbonate are called soda springs as late as the 1990s the lost river cave was an ecological disaster the mindset of some locals that it was a holeto fill it up a concerned and dedicated crew hauled several tons of debris up and out of the valley due to the quick drainage of rainwater directly into sinkholes karst aquifers can be easily contaminated since karst formations have high permeability this results in fewer opportunities for contaminants to be filtered out of the groundwater this groundwater provides drinking water springs to feed our waterways and as a habitat for subterranean species the rivers and springs in such areas are easily contaminated residents must be vigilant and work together to protect the water entering the ground due to the sensitive ecosystem of the lost river cave the city of bowling green partnered with the lost river cave and valley to construct a wetlands treatment system to remove pollutants from the groundwater before it reaches lost river cave the wetland system will benefit the park and all of the

lost river cave has one of the largest cave entrances east of the mississippi river the cave was first inhabited by american indians as 8000 years ago from the late 1700s to the early 1900s the caves entrance was the site of many waterpowered mills producing flours lumber brandy and carded wool during the civil war lost river cave and valley were occupied first by the confederate army in 1861 then in 1862 by the union army it was believed that jesse james and his gang stayed in the cave after their robbery of a bank in russellville in 1868 during the 1930s 40s and early 50s the cave was a popular night club it then went into disuse and was neglected in 1990 friends of the lost river worked to remove debris and clean up the cave and reopen it in 1999 the boat tours began at lost river cave the historic entrance into the lost river cave is one of 5 natural entrances the cave is approximately 7 miles long and is hydrogeologically connected to other caves in the system the cave passageways wind around underneath the city of bowling green resulting in creative engineering since the establishment of the city in the 1775 in the early years the uses of the cave were very primitive for example piping into the underlying passageways as septic tank dump stations now greater knowledge of the cave its ecosystem and its connection to surface waters has resulted in

blanche decided to beat them to it she excitedly ran home after work and recruited her elevenyearold brother orris they grabbed some candles and snuck out of the house blanche and orris quickly hiked

peered inside ignoring the darkness and the mud blanche squeezed into the hole soon she called up to orris come on in together blanche and orris crawled down the steep slippery slope they found themselves in a large chamber that appeared to continue in several directions they heard water falling and saw formations in the distance though awed by the beauty of their discovery their flickering candles caused their courage to ebb the pair decided to turn back the slimy cold mud made climbing out much harder blanche and orris safely reached the top the late summer sun felt good on their skin as the two siblings now covered with mud headed home the original land owner was notified of the caves discovery a few days later and the cave was immediately opened to the public for tours geology of marengo cave marengo cave is classified as a karst cave the forming of karst caves is very complicated and it is still a topic of geological research but some basic aspects are very simple water containing carbon dioxide is able to dissolve limestone unlike with salt and gypsum water is not able to dissolve limestone without a little help and this helper is carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is a very common gas you know it from sparkling water softdrinks and beer they all contain it it makes them bubbling natural water also contains co2 but much much less as it is normally not bubbling just fill some water in a bottle and after some hours you will see small gas bubbles at the glass of the bottle carbon dioxide is in the the air about 003 percent of our atmosphere is this gas animals and humans breathe air consume the oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide many carbon dioxide is produced by biologic processes in the soil when the rain water falls it first absorbs some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but then oozing through the soil it absorbs much more biogene co2 in the water the co2 breaks up in two pieces thus producing a very weak acid when water gets in contact with limestone the acid solutes the limestone this happens on the rock surface just at the border between rock and soil but when the limestone which is originally water proof contains cracks produced by tectonic forces which is very common the water oozes into the rock and starts to widen the cracks and solute caves inside the layers with the small amount of co2 the amount of soluted limestone is very small and it takes several ten thousand years or more to form a cave the limestone in the spring water in karst areas is very common and well known to the people living in those areas if you heat this water the co2 escapes and the limestone gets solid again this process is similar to the forming of many speleothems in caves like drip stones formations marengo cave is truly blessed with a wide variety of speleothemscave mineral deposits these are commonly known as formations stalactites hang from the ceiling soda straws are baby stalactites stalagmites grow up from the floor flowstone deposits anywhere water flows draperies form along slanted ceilings helictites are strange unusual formations cave popcorn is knoblike in appearance rimstone dams form around pools of water cave life marengo

can be found on the ncc website today gatineau park is an important nature preserve measuring 36131 hectares but that wasnt always the case early settlers found the area attractive for fur trapping forestry and mining the region was explored drilled and exploited for the riches it contained and entrepreneurs made use of its forests water power and even its underground resources one of the remnants of this era can be found along the pink lake trail here you will find the pit from an old mica mine the word mica is thought to be derived from the latin word micare meaning to glitter in reference to the brilliant appearance of this mineral especially when in small scales it was one of the most interesting minerals we learned about in my junglehair geology classes mica is the glittery mineral you find in schist and the dark flecks you find in certain types of granite two main types of mica are muscovite and biotite muscovite is colourless but may be green or light yellow biotite is a dark colour the mica minerals are distinguished by their perfect basal cleavage which means that they are easily split into thin often transparent sheets it is very resistant to chemical and thermal attack because it has high electrical resistivity and dielectric strength muscovite sheet mica large flat sheets which can be cut or stamped into required shapes is used as an insulator in electrical and electronic equipment its many uses include lasers pyrometers radar systems missile systems and aerospace components the largest documented single crystal of mica phlogopite was found in lacey mine near kingston ontario it measured 10x43x43 m and weighed about 330 metric tons the mica mine at gatineau park in the 19th century mica was valuable for its use as a heatproof window material and later as an electrical insulator mica mined in the park was transported to hull where it was cut and processed twenty tons 18 metric tons of mica were removed from two pits over 30 feet 9 metres deep one crystal of mica was removed from this mine that reportedlyweighed more than 500 pounds about 227 kilograms today the most easily accessed mica mine in the area is the pink lake mica mine this mine was first prospected by the kent brothers of kingston in 1903 by 1904 the mine was producing mica which was being shipped along the rideau canal to kingston where it was cut and readied for market this mine consists mostly of surface cuts most of which were opened using steampowered machinery by 1905 by the mid1910s the mine had closed down only to be reopened by the pinks lake mining company at the end of 1945 this company even ran a tunnel from the edge of the lake to the earlier surface pits but this was the last gasp for the mine it was closed by 1946 and all the equipment was removed source

the niobec underground niobium mine is located twenty five kilometres northwest of ville de saguenay chicoutimi within the limits of the municipality of sainthonore quebec the niobec mine is readily accessible by existing paved roads and benefits from available water supply and hydroelectric generated power supply from the regional power grid the niobec mine is surrounded by a mixture of forest and farms geology mineralization geology the niobec deposit lies within the southern portion of the sainthonore carbonatite within the grenville structural province of the canadian shield stockwell 1964 dimroth et al 1981 subdivides the grenville province into three distinct lithostructural units a gneiss complex the anorthosite and charnockitemangerite batholiths and the calcalkaline intrusions the development of the early paleozoic stlawrence river rift system was associated with extensive alkaline igneous activity kumarapeli and saull 1966 including the emplacement of the sainthonore carbonatite 650 ma vallee and dubuc 1970 a carbonatite is an igneous rock comprising at least fifty percent carbonate minerals occurrences on a global scale are sparse and widely distributed dominant carbonate minerals in order of decreasing abundance include calcite dolomite ankerite and rarely siderite and magnesite the sthonore alkaline complex is almost completely covered by trenton limestone of palaeozoic age and is elliptical in plan view with a major axial length of approximately four kilometres it consists of a series of crescentic lenses of carbonatite with compositions becoming younger progressively inwards from calcitite through dolomitite to ferrocarbonatite rocks immediately surrounding the complex are composed of magnetite diorite as well as hypersthene syenite mineralization niobiumbearing minerals of bipyramidal form are disseminated throughout the carbonatite the economic mineralization is comprised of ferrian and sodic pyrochlore generally in association with geological units rich in magnetite biotite and apatite the niobiumbearing minerals dispersed in the rock are finegrained 02 to 08 mm in diameter and rarely visible to the naked eye such that diamond drilling is the only way to evaluate the economic content of mineralized zones mineralized envelopes vary between 45 and 180 meters in width northsouth direction while their length can reach almost 750 meters the zones have a known vertical extent of approximately 750 meters although they remain open at depth the deepest completed drill holes are mineralized at grades equivalent to those of current ore production dips are generally vertical or steeply dipping >70deg to the northwest or northeast average grades of the large mineralized envelopes are between 044 and 051 nb2o5 the majority of the mineral reserves and the measured and indicated resources are located in the four first mining blocks between 90 and 560 meters in depth the bulk of the mineral resources classified as inferred are exclusively found in mining blocks 4 5 and 6 between depths ranging from 560 to 730 meters mine operations are concentrated between depths of 100 to 440 meters currently operating simultaneously on three mining blocks niobium in its natural state what is niobium niobium nb is a soft rare transition metal used in the production of high grade steel it is an alloying agent which when added to another material creates a material with substantial benefits steel containing niobium has many attractive properties making it highly desirable for use in the automotive gas pipeline and construction industries steel made with niobium is stronger lighter in weight and corrosion resistan where is niobium found niobium is found primarily in brazil and canada which account for about 99 of total reported niobium production and in australia the united states geological survey estimates world reserves at 27 mm mt of contained niobium niobium occurs in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite which contain niobium and tantalum in varying proportions the mineral pyrochlore is mined primarily for its niobium content columbite is mined primarily for tantalum with niobium extracted as a biproduct roskill estimates that approximately 97 of niobium is found in the mineral pyrochlore to log this cache you need to answer four questions 1= what is the method of the mine in sthonore

region had seen a strange material which came in veins in rocks on a hill called webb s ledge in visits at his parents in 1881 a miner of the name of evan williams was the first to identify this ore as some asbestos and to admit the commercial value shortly afterwards mister wh jeffrey gives the necessary funds to start the working of a mine on this site at the beginning the mining development leant on primitive methods they blew up then of the excavated hole rather shallow the asbestos manually was picked up the first shoring used to take back up the ore was operated by a single horse of course the modern methods of production are much more sophisticated working stretches far under the surface of the earth underground galleries today in fews last years the mine jeffrey knew many owners she suffered some serious economic problems and the fall of worldwide request for the asbestos was caused by the perception of health hazards linked to this ore today the mine belongs in jm asbestos inc she occupies a diameter of more than two kilometres a 350metre depth and a total area of six km2 this mine is the largest roofless mine in the western world the ore the chrysotile has exceptional properties he resists heat fire wear and chemical substances it is a good thermal electrical and acoustical insulating material his silky fibres can be spun and weaved they can also be added to other substances as the cotton the resin the cement or the paper its unique characteristics were worth him the nickname of magical mineral he enters the composition of products as the

microorganisms pressure atmospheric influences and even diggingmost caves are formed in limestone by dissolution solutional caves are the most frequently occurring caves and such caves form in rock that is soluble such as limestone but can also form in other rocks including chalk dolomite marble salt and gypsum rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through beddingplanes faults joints etc over geological epochs cracks expand to become caves or cave systems the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with h2co3 carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes and underground drainage limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation these include flowstones stalactites stalagmites helictites soda straws and

entrepreneurs hired laborers to mine upper silurian rondout formation dolostones and fossiliferous limestones from the earth this rock unit is largely comprised of the shells of calcareous organisms that lived in a shallow warmwater ocean some 400 million years ago this rosendale bedrock came to be recognized as the highest quality natural cement in north america it was known as an hydraulic cement because it hardened well under water the cement industry was founded in 1819 in central new york but soon shifted to the rosendalekingston region in 1827 where it flourished for over 150 years during much of that time the region was known as the cement capitol of the world natural cement production peaked in 1899 with an estimated annual production of almost ten million barrels of cement records of the century house historical society document that the century cement plant in rosendale was the last cement works to manufacture natural cement in north america the rosendale region maintained its competitive edge because of its ready market transportation access via the delaware and hudson canal the rondout creek and the hudson river the natural cement was used in many wellknown landmarks including the us capitol building the brooklyn bridge the pedestal of the statue of liberty the washington monument and the delaware and hudson canal production of the natural cement required a laborintensive refining process involving firing in kilns cracking and grinding prior to packaging in cement powderfilled 300pound wooden barrels miners excavated two narrow 10 to 26 foot thick members of the rondout formation faithfully following them along complexly folded and faulted bedrock layers often deeply below the water table today we see the results of their efforts in mines that are nearly level at shallow and steep angles vertical and even stacked one on top of another as they removed the bedrock using sledgehammers star drills black powder and much later pneumatic drills they would essentially create large rooms for safety they left large pillars to support the overlying bedrock ceiling or adjacent wall rock thus these mines are referred to as roomandpillar

newgate deposit is of the former type and is referred to as a stratabound deposit the sulfide minerals bornite cu5fes4 and chalcopyrite cufes2 partially replaced by chalcocite cu2s are the principal ore minerals an ore mineral is any mineral that contains a useable element in a chemical form that is easy to purify metalbearing sulfide minerals are easy to purify by smelting in an oxidizing environment the bornite and chalcopyrite are difficult to spot in the mine because of their scarcity they were most all removed by mining activities and the dim lighting they are both dark colored they were disseminated in grey sandstones at or about the stratigraphic level of the talcott basalt brightly colored malachite cu2co3oh2 and cuprite cu2o are more conspicuous but are clearly secondary after the primary ore minerals they are easily seen in the mine more than 200 million years ago during the mesozoic era sand and mud which later hardened to sandstone and shale were deposited by prehistoric streams that flowed across this area of connecticut when originally formed the layers of sand and mud were nearly horizontal significant tilting of the layers occurred several millions of years later today the mine floor and ceiling slope at about 20o following the strike and dip tilt of the ore layer mineralization of the sandstone occurred before the rock was buried deeply enough to compact it ironrich dolomite ankerite recognizable by its rusty weathering precipitated first from groundwater that percolated through the rock later copperbearing sulfurrich solutions of hot salinewater migrated through the sandstone and deposited the primary ore minerals bornite and chalcopyrite or chalcocite later still copper was leached from the ore and deposited as malachite and

basin they are part of the jurassic aged intrusive igneous rocks and are composed of diabase and basalt they were intruded at the beginning of the jurassic period as part of the igneous event that formed the lava flows of the talcott basalt the mineralizing fluids may have been in part heated by these intrusive rocks the hills in the distant background that form the skyline are underlain by paleozoic metamorphic rocks a fault is found at the base of those hills looking behind you toward the east one sees the imposing cliffs held up by the holyoke basalt a lava flow that is younger than

permission of berea college the reserve is open daylight hours only and the collection of specimens either biological cultural or mineral and defacement of geological features andor vegetation is strictly prohibited pig mans cave was formed by erosion over a period of many years at one point in time it was part of the adjacent ridge that ridge was highly fractured over time the moisture freezing and expanding caused the rock to crack along these fractures and fall away from the ridge into it current location then the differential weathering of the softer rock stratum in the middle section out paced weathering of the harder rock stratum the top pig mans cave rock shelter is formed on a rocky bluff in anglin falls rock shelters form because of the process of differential weathering on the rock stratum over time anglin falls creek slowly eroded the sandstone forming a cliff or bluff above the valley the upper sandstone stratum was more resistant than the lower stratum which lies just below thus the lower stratum more quickly eroded allowing the upper stratum to be undercut this undercut forms the rock shelter weathering will continually undercut the less resistant stratum while also eroding the other resistant strata eventually portions of the roof will begin to collapse and fall to litter the floor of the rock shelter the final phase or the death of a rock shelter will be when the roof has a total collapse and there is no longer an alcove present the rock shelter is composed of sandstone called the grundy formation its an soft sandstone because of this water is the main force that created this rock shelter the primary lithology for the gf is shale siltstone sandstone and coal shale and siltstone irregularly interbedded with sandstone and coal shale

playground carter county has over two hundred caves sinkholes and other formations many of which are within the boundaries of the park itself in the early times of our country eastern kentucky was essential for iron ore and iron production timber salt and saltpeter saltpeter is the primary ingredient about 75 used in manufacturing gunpowder black powder its chemical name and formula is potassium nitrate kno3 the cave at this location was a source for saltpeter to be mined for gun powder production for kentucky citizens fighting the british during the war of 1812 this somewhat forgotten war fought between 1812 and 1815 occurred mostly along the border with canada near the gulf of mexico and the chesapeake bay region since the americans had defeated the british during the revolutionary war a few years earlier hard feelings and pride had kept the british at or near these areas their refusal to leave the american territory along the great lakes and their support of the indians on the frontiers forced the united states to go to war again formation of the cave this region is rich with karst topography areas where ground water has dissolved and eroded the underground rock this provides for the formation of caves and sinkholes which are abundant in kentucky as surface water soaks into the soil it continues downward by gravity until it contacts the underlying rock strata small cracks in the layers of rock provide a means for the water to erode away or dissolve the rock limestone and its family including dolostone are susceptible to this chemical break down by water as the water continues to flow into the rock it widens and deepens the crevice which formed the cave seen here there are two areas in the state that are particularly well known for these features mammoth cave and carter caves both of these areas formed in the same way formation of salt peter this cave provided the much needed ingredient saltpeter for the kentucky militia who were vital for our countries defense the cave at these coordinates was not as we see it today but rather mostly filled with dirt and other sediments by digging out the cave and mixing the sediments with water the potassium nitrate could be removed from the solution some mining equipment and a few of the wooden sloughs used to allow water to carry the solution form one location to the other can still be seen in the cave itself the removal of the material has allowed the visitors to now walk instead of crawl through the cave carter caves is well known for the population of bats that inhabit the caves in the area these animals provided the necessary bacteria from there excrement called guano for the formation of the saltpeter as the groundwater dissolved the limestone the guano allowed for nitrification the conversion of nitrogen compounds into nitrates to occur this is the basic process for the formation of saltpeter today black powder is not used as much as it once was it can be used for basic fireworks and is important for civil war reenactors cannon firing etc one of the main problems with the black powder was its corrosiveness when fired barrels had to be thoroughly cleaned to maintain future accuracy and functioning modern firearms use smokeless powders and propellants which are noncorrosive for the most part modern factories today sometimes include potassium nitrate as a preservative in food preparation and it can be refined to make nitric acid which is used in the manufacture of the explosive tnt saltpeter cave is located just across the road from the visitors center

be lower and the amount of sand too although sand cave is just a rock shelter there are various features of a true cave on hot summer days the inner parts stay cool the location has impressive accoustics voices echo off the sandstone walls i noticed this when i walked into the cave i had passed some hikers on the trail on my way to sand cave i went to the back wall of the cave and took some pictures out of nowhere i heard voices just behind me it was the hikers voices and they where in the lower part of the cave by the water fall nearly 200 feet away the voices sounded as if they where next to me pretty cool i thought and startling at the same time decades ago churches used to hold singings at the site this was in prepark days when sand cave was accessible by road from the kentucky side now its only accessable by trail sand cave is named after its content the floor of the cave is covered by a beautiful yellow and red sand this sand is the residual of the cave erosion and has formed in piles and dunes inside the huge cavern sand cave is a wind cave sand cave isnt an actual cave rather its an enormous rock shelter carved by the erosional forces of wind water and ice at the low end of the opening is a waterfall just before you get near sand cave you will drop into a green alcove where hemlocks and rhododendron grow along a crystal clear stream sandstone is a very common sedimentary rock and perhaps the best known sedimentary rock it is formed in many environments as the name implies sand cave is composed of sand the grains of sand is composed of individual crystals of various minerals such as quartz iron oxides manganese oxides and other impurities can cause bright and contrasting colors in sandstones these colors are what gives sandstone its unique character and ornamental desirability the colors range from bright whites reds yellows oranges and even purples and greens colored sandstone is usually intricately banded in multiple colors which enhance its aesthetic appeal the sandstone deposits of sand cave is a beautiful part of the natural environment in the cave did you know that sand cave sits on top of the greenbrier limestone formation the greenbrier limestone was deposited in a subsiding basin in southeastern west virginia and adjacent virginia and across a broad shallow shelf located to the north and northwest oolitic limestones are thick and extensive in southern west virginia but most thin and change in character to the north an area of uplift the west virginia dome was active along the zone of change in northcentral west virginia the dome was exposed during early greenbrier deposition and remained as a submarine high throughout deposition of these predominantly oolitic mississippianaged limestones be prepared to allow the better part of the day to make this hike to sand cave its a guaranteed 8 mile round trip i timed myself to the cave and made it in a time of 122 that was at a brisk pace and i only stopped for water i think about 3 miles of the hike was uphill now if you want to take the family a partner or friends be prepared for an 6 hour hike round trip bring food water phone and be sure to sign in on the trail guest box on weekends hiking traffic is moderate and the trail is never crowded during the week its one of the parks overlooked jewels while on the trail you can see white rocks white rocks overlooks the green fields of virginias powell river valley powell mountain is in the foreground and in the middle distance is clinch mountain on a clear day you can see the smokies in the far distance and make out mount leconte sand cave is located in the cumberland mountain ridge north of ewing va this is one of several mountain ridges running from the east to the west this is where the fun starts the ewing trail provides access to both its a 39 mile one way to sand cave if you visit both white rocks and sand cave in one day youll end up hiking about nine miles the elevation gain on the ewing trail to white rocks is 2000 feet but there are numerous switchbacks so the hike isnt too difficult it takes 90 minutes to reach the ewing trail from knoxville take interstate 75 north to the lafollette exit and follow state route 63 all the way to harrogate at harrogate turn left at us highway 25e and take a right onto us highway 58 east at cumberland gap follow highway 58 for 12 miles to ewing va and take a left onto state route 724 the ewing trail starts at the end of route 724 which is also marked as sand cave road permission for this earthcache is allowed by the cumberland

variety of rock types and are caused by differing geological formations and processes caves can range in size from caves the size of small rooms like the one that you will be examining to the long formations that are miles upon miles long the scientific study of caves is called speleology caves have been dated to prehistoric times evidence of early human remains have been found in caves paintings called hieroglyphics have been found in caves and have been dated back hundreds of thousands of years early man of the cromagnon period constructed murals on the walls of caves that depicted everyday life caves are one of the earliest forms of shelter they were instrumental in the ice age for use of shelter types of caves a simple classification of caves includes four main types of caves solution caves are formed in carbonate and sulfate rocks such as limestone dolomite marble and gypsum the action of slow moving ground water dissolves the rock and forms tunnels passages and caverns this is the most common type of cave and some experts say its the easiest to identify lava caves are tunnels or tubes in lava formed when the outer surface of a lava flow cools and hardens while the molten lava within continues to flow and eventually drains out through the newly formed tube sea caves are formed by the constant action of waves which attacks the weaker portions of rocks lining the shores of oceans and large lakes such caves testify to the enormous pressures exerted by waves and to the corrosive power of wavecarried sand and gravel glacier caves are formed by melt water which excavates drainage tunnels through the ice of entirely different origin and not to be included in the category of glacier caves are socalled ice caves which usually are either solution caves or lava caves within which ice forms and persists through all or most of the year how caves form the meltwater streams draining out along the floor of a glacier cave or the surging pounding waves at the mouth of a sea cave offer immediate evidence of the origin of these caves solution caves however have always been a source of wonder to man how do these extensive complex and in some places beautifully decorated passageways develop solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water they can be thought of as part of a huge subterranean plumbing system after a rain water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock and percolates beneath the land surface eventually some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water the term water table refers to the upper surface of this saturated zone calcite calcium carbonate the main mineral of limestone is barely soluble in pure water rainwater however absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation the water combining chemically with the carbon dioxide forms a weak carbonic acid solution this acid slowly dissolves calcite forms solution cavities and excavates passageways the resulting calcium bicarbonate solution is carried off in the underground drainage system a second stage in cave development occurs after a lowering of the water table the water table normally sinks as the river valleys deepen during this stage the solution cavities are stranded in the unsaturated zone where air can enter this leads to the deposition of calcite which forms a wide variety of dripstone features the chemical process causing deposition of calcite is the reverse of the process of solution water in the unsaturated zone which dissolved some calcite as it trickled down through the limestone above the cave is still enriched with carbon dioxide when it reaches the ventilated cave the carbon dioxide gas escapes from the water just as it escapes from an opened bottle of soda pop the acidity of the water is thereby reduced the calcium bicarbonate cannot remain in solution and calcite is deposited as dripstone cave features the most familiar types of features are stalactites and stalagmites stalactites hang downward from the ceiling and are formed as drop after drop of water slowly trickles through cracks in the cave roof as each drop of water hangs from the ceiling it loses carbon dioxide and deposits a film of calcite successive drops add ring below ring the water dripping through the hollow center of the rings until a pendant cylinder forms tubular or soda straw stalactites grow in this way most are fragile and have the diameter of a drop of water but some reach a length of perhaps a yard or more the large coneshaped stalactites begin as these fragile tubes and then enlarge to cones when enough water accumulates to flow along the outside of the soda straws deposition of calcite on the outside of the tubes most of which are near the ceiling and taper downward results in the familiar cone shapes stalagmites grow upward from the floor of the cave generally as a result of water dripping from overhanging stalactites a column forms when a stalactite and a stalagmite grow until they join a curtain or drapery begins to form on an inclined ceiling when the drops of water trickle along a slope gradually a thin sheet of calcite grows downward from the ceiling and hangs in decorative folds like a drape sheets of calcite that are deposited on the walls or floor by flowing water are called flowstone rimstone dams are raised fencelike deposits of calcite on the cave floor that form around pools of water rock material produced by the collapse of the ceiling or walls of a cave is called breakdown and may range in size from plates and chips to massive blocks most breakdown present in caves today appears to have occurred thousands of years ago

early settlers arrived expecting ground that would be excellent to farm and discovered instead bedrock just below the surface of topsoil making this land difficult to plant crops and establish a farming community other sources of income were needed so mining operations in addition to the logging in the area became profitable for a period of time silver queen mine is one of several mines in the area that produced mainly mica as well as apatite which is also known as phosphate and is often found alongside mica and feldspar this vast region of ancient rock known as the canadian shield was once part of the tallest mountain range in the earths history and over time was eroded down exposing the metamorphic rock which was formed in the earths crust by tremendous heat and pressure murphys point lies on the frontenac axis a narrow extension of the canadian shield that links to the adirondack mountain range thanks to several periods of erosion and glaciation these mountains were stripped of the overlaying rock and have exposed the billion year old mountain core bedrock that make up the frontenac axis mica mica is the mineral name given to a group of silicate minerals known as sheet silicate because they form in distinct layers micas are light and relatively soft and the sheets and flakes of mice are flexible mica is often used in electronics as it is heat resistant and does not conduct electricity apatite apatite is the name of a group of phosphate minerals with similar chemical compositions and physical properties they are an important constituent of phosphorite a rock mined for its phosphorus content and used to make fertilizers acids and chemicals a particular type of feldspar called perthite was used in the making of porcelain and earthenware feldspar feldspars are a group of rockforming tectosilicate minerals that make up about 41 of the earths continental crust by weight feldspars crystallize from magma as veins in both intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock mining operations sheet mica sheet mica is mined by either sinking a shaft along the strike and dip of a pegmatite or by open pit surface mining of semi hard pegmatite ore once a mineral deposit was found the work of prying the crystals away from surrounding rock would begin often explosives would be used to break up large sections of rock into smaller chunks that were more manageable but first bore holes would need to be drilled to set up the blasts in the early days this was done by hand with hammers and brute strength a team of 3 men would work together and could average 12 feet per hour much later when steampowered drills were in use care had to be taken and often deposits of good quality crystals were still drilled by hand and only lightly loaded with explosives open quarry mining located at stop 11 on the silver queen mine trail you will find a small open pit quarry that looked for feldspar a cloudy white mineral this mineral crystallized out of the same molten rock intrusions that formed the veins of apatite and mica and was the third mineral to be mined at the silver queen mine facts about the silver queen mine the silver queen mine was at its operational peak during the early 1900s and employed less than 30 men the mine mainly produced small sheets of mica which was used in the electrical industry as an insulator in items such as toasters and as windows in items such as lanterns the mined products would be packed in barrels and sent via the rideau canal to factories in eastern ontario and western

greenbrier limestone formation some of the caves contain dome pits up to 125 feet deep as well as small tight crawlways large enough for a small person or child to enter indiana bat endangered other bats rats beetles and several invertebrates have been found in many of the parks caves one of these caves is the very popular skylight cave skylight cave is an often visited and beautiful cave its well worth the hike to see the cave is called skylight for a reason on the upper portion of the cave is a smaller opening that allows light inside the cave when you walk into the cave you will see what i am talking about on a good sunny day when the sun sets to the west there will be a beam of light that comes into the upper cave opening which provides some good photo opportunities the geology of skylight cave skylight cave is formed in the greenbrier limestone formation the greenbrier limestone was deposited in a subsiding basin in southeastern west virginia and adjacent virginia and across a broad shallow shelf located to the north and northwest oolitic limestones are thick and extensive in southern west virginia but most thin and change in character to the north an area of uplift the west virginia dome was active along the zone of change in northcentral west virginia the dome was exposed during early greenbrier deposition and remained as a submarine high throughout deposition of these predominantly oolitic mississippianaged limestones the transition from oolitic grainstones that contain welldeveloped ooids through grainstones that comprise less welldeveloped ooids mixed with detrital quartz sand to poorly washed quartzsandy oolitic packstones is interpreted to indicate flooding of the shoals around the west virginia dome cave geology skylight cave is formed in a rock that is highly soluble in water which is enriched with carbonic acid the water comes from rainfall and when it enters the soil it mixes with plant material where it picks up carbon dioxide the mixture of carbon dioxide and water forms a carbonic acid the carbonic acid enriched water finds its way into the water table this can be referred to as ground water the ground water finds its way into tiny pores and cracks in the limestone layer and slowly begins to dissolve the greenbrier limestone as time goes on the pockets and cracks enlarge to form small chambers in the rock there are occasions that the water table can create a hydrostatic pressure which will erode the limestone rock away quicker as time goes on the erosion process creates larger crevices and passages for the water to flow in more ground water is able to enter the passages and erode away the limestone even more quickly the passage grows in size with each rainfall but this is a slow process no one is able to predict how long it takes a cave to form some caves are formed faster than others and this all depends on the geological layout of the area eventually in geologic time passages are formed which are large enough to walk in hey cav what are all those cool rock formations in the cave formations in skylight cave come in all different shapes sizes and colors generally speaking the formations seen in skylight cave are made out of calcite which is a precipitate of calcium carbonate the added colors are due to mineral impurities mixed in with the calcite calcium carbonate is highly soluble in the carbonic acid found in ground water the ground water becomes saturated with calcium carbonate on its journey through the limestone the air in a cave is chemically the same as air outside the cave with the exception that it is very low in carbon dioxide the ground water entering the cave is very high in carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate therefore the ground water entering the cave is out of equilibrium with the cave environment and there is a transfer of carbon dioxide to the cave atmosphere causing calcite to precipitate out this is how formations are formed a water droplet that hangs from the ceiling of the cave will leave a small deposit of calcite before it is forced to fall to the floor of the cave the repetition of this act forms what is called a stalactite on the ceiling of the cave and a stalagmite on the floor of the cave if the process is allowed to continue long enough the two will join to form a column the names of the cave formations there are numerous names for different types of formations such as draperies curtains bacon soda straws shields and rimstone just to name a few needless to say the process is the same whether it is accomplished from a drip from the ceiling or water running down the wall of a passage formations are delicate works of nature which can take thousands of years to form there are other minerals and formations seen in caves such as fluorite dogtooth spar helectites aragonite and gypsum but these types of formations are much rarer and even more delicate there is also life or fauna found skylight cave these come in all shapes and sizes from a microscopic organism to larger species like bats and salamanders crayfish can be found living in the streams of caves as well as different species of fish generally most species that inhabit a cave have pigment and eyes but there are some species that have no eyes or color due to a long genetic evolution these are the exception rather than the rule crickets and small beetles also inhabit cave environments the list of fauna is too large to describe them all but i have given you a few examples of what to expect the upper entrance skylight cave is protected remember skylight cave is protected by law while you are allowed to walk into the cave dont forget it is also protected by law whether its state or federal and there are fines imposed on those who would destroy any part of the cave environment the motto of a good caver is to take only pictures leave only footprints and as few of those as possible and kill nothing but time this is where the fun starts the beginning of

log book for you to sign at a earthcache for anyone who doesnt want to post a picture of their face then log the find as a note or dont do it at all nobody is forcing anyone to come and visit any of my earthcaches i could argue that signing a log at a traditional cache is violating my personal rights because i have to sign a piece of paper maybe someone will forge my signature and steal my identity an argument that a photo violates a persons identity is foolish geocaching is a social activity eventually someone will meet you and know you are geocaching if you want to live a secretive life then geocaching is not the place to do so cache on do not log this ec unless you have answered the questions and have a picture ready to post logs with no photo of the actual cacher logging the find or failure to answer questions or negative comments will result in a log deletion without notice exceptions will be considered if you contact me first i realize sometimes we forget our cameras or the batteries die you must post a photo at the time of logging your find if your picture is not ready then wait until you have a photo sources of information for the earthcache quoted from the cumberland national historic park i have used sources available to me by using google search to get information for this earth cache i am by no means a geologist i use books internet and ask questions about geology just like 999 percent of the geocachers who create these great earth caches i enjoy earth caches and want people to get out and see what i see every time i go and explore this great place we live in"

lightly raining and felt like i was passing through a magical otherworldly rainforest awesome 2 our veteran tour guide asked the group if they would like an added adventure not part of the tour yikes that was as close to spelunking minus the crawling that this terrainchallenged senior ever wants to experience again first had to get down the cliff to the rocks below ok it was only a few feet but seemed like a cliff then there were all the challenges to negotiate others were oohing while i was watching my step finally we walked millimeters next to a pool of water over sandy substrate one slip

state park naturalist for permission to share this learning adventure your permit for the earthcache cascade cave is 19103ccsrp cave this is the most popular cave but also the most challenging in terms of length and terrain lots of stairs however it is also the cave with the greatest variety of speleothems it is cut from the warix run member of the slade formation the cavern itself is made up of a series of parallel passages that are filled with dripstone formations of different types the large size of the passages suggests that they formed along a series of bedding planes and vertical joints the entrance to cascade cave is located along one of the many sinkholes in the area just north and west of box canyon wet cave vs dry cave speleothems are receiving water and so are still growing there is no longer a water source in a dry cave so speleothems are no longer growing speleothems speleothems are predominantly limestone formations found in caves they take various forms depending on whether the water drips seeps condenses flows or ponds as you journey through this cave you will see a variety of cave formations ceiling stalactites are pointed pendants soda straws are thin and long helictites have a central canal with spiral projections chandeliers are complex clusters floor stalagmites are blunt mounds broomsticks are tall and spindly totem poles are tall and shaped like their namesakes columns form when stalactites and stalagmites meet or when stalactites reach the floor walls flowstone is sheetlike draperies or curtains are thin wavy sheets bacon is a drapery with variously colored bands rimstone dams form barriers that may contain water stone waterfalls simulate frozen cascades popcorn cave coral is small knobby clusters of calcite cathedral room this room formed beneath several sinkholes which conduct surface water into cracks the water seeping into cracks leading to the cathedral room has resulted in the formation of a variety of dripstone formations over the years it is reached by taking a short path to the base of a large limestone cliff frozen cascades room the speleothems here are a series of small travertine waterfalls giving this room its name it occurs along a narrow passage that is aligned along a joint fracture travertine rock is a type of limestone commonly deposited by mineral springs through a process of rapid precipitation of carbonate minerals lake room this room is named for a large reflecting pool of water the room is located at the intersection of two joints which act as a conduit for groundwater as active groundwater ran down these joints they were enlarged water from james branch enters the lake along a lowerlevel passage and exits the cave system through a small opening along the base of the northeast wall it then makes its way to tygarts creek rockwater relationship water is necessary for speleothems to form the nature of the cave formation depends on whether the water drips seeps

ancestral eastern north american continent by plate tectonic force the subduction or forcing down of the oceanic crust underneath the north american continent produced tremendous frictiongenerated heat from the two colliding continents this frictiongenerated heat in excess of 2000 degrees fahrenheit melted the surrounding rock 9 to 15 miles below the surface this igneous molten rock was generated under intense pressure that forced the molten rock into cracks and fissures of preexisting rock this molten rock under pressure is similar to hot hydraulic fluid being forced into a chamber due to the pressure exerted on the molten fluid it hydraulically pushed its way through the cracks of the host rock this opened the rock up along with melting contact areas of the host rock and sucking up rich mineral forming fluids as these cooled they crystallized and became a mineralrich buried treasure it then took an estimated 100 million years for this deeply buried and insulated mass to cool and crystallize the slowly cooling mineral crystals grew within the area to some of the largest feldspar and mica crystals in the world after molten emplacement and cooling it took millions of more years of appalachian mountain building and subsequent erosion to expose the deposits we see today along with muscovite mica feldspar plagioclase perthite and quartz occur at the ray mica mine other minerals reported are golden and aquamarine beryl apatite crystals clear oligoclase plagioclase feldspar amazonite thulite garnet autunite columbitetantalite tourmaline zircon and rutile area history the story of prospecting and mineral production in the area began before recorded time when the ancients mined for glittering mica during the woodland age 2000 years ago the ancients an early name given to the native americans by settlers of the area mined mica for grave decoration and wampum which they traded as money the mica is known to have been traded as far away as the ohio valley and is believed to have originated from native american mines in the spruce pineburnsville area now known as the clarissa ray and sinkhole mines legend is that this mining of mica led hernando desoto to the area around 1540 in search of mineral wealth that he thought to be gold and silver he found only silver mica better known as muscovite mica later around 1744 legend is that cherokee indians mined semiweathered feldspar mica and kaolin from the spruce pine pegmatites and used oxendrawn sleds to transport it to the coast where it was loaded on ships bound for england in england it was used as an ingredient for patented english ceramic wares from 1767 to 1911 mining of feldspar and mica occurred sporadically mica was mined to fuel the demand for the newlydeveloped edison electric motor in 1878 the motor required the electrical insulating properties of sheet mica feldspar and mica were being handmined at hundreds of holes pits and mines throughout mitchell avery and yancey counties which make up the spruce pine mining district until the mid to late1940s most work especially ore separation of minerals was done by hand with crude machinery and hand tools between 1944 and 1949 the process of chemical separation of minerals was jointly developed by the feldspar mining company the north carolina feldspar corporation the tennessee valley authority and the north carolina state mineral research laboratory of asheville this process led to the current large volume highcapacity process of separating the minerals of feldspar mica quartz and garnet from the rock ore todays uses mica comprises about 10 of the rock mass in the area once highly valued for wood and coalburning stove windows often called isinglass and for radio tube insulators during both world wars it is now used as an industrial products special additive muscovite which is silver to white mica variety is mostly ground to a fine particle size it is valued for its flat particle shape it is used mostly as a major ingredient of drywall joint compound or sheet rock joint cement muscovites flat particle shape and light color allow it to serve as an antishrinking agent for the cement after it is applied to sheet rock joints it applies as smooth damp putty but because of muscovite micas flat particle shape it interlocks the mud as it dries therefore reinforcing the mud as it dries without shrinkage it also acts as a fire retardant within the sheet rock joint mica is also produced for use as special electrical insulators automobile metallic flake paint womens makeup and as a reinforcing additive in

area now known as abingdon va daniel with one of his dogs at one point during daniel boones stay in the area a pack of wolves emerged from a nearby cave and attacked the hunting dogs that were with

yards from main street it was at the bottom of court house hill where boone and his fellow hunters made their camp the cave later became known as the wolf cave and runs under what is locally known as

owners rights must be respected by peering through the slabs of the latticework you will be treated to a wonderful cave entrance and a view of early american history how are karst area caves formed limestone caves are formed by erosion as rainwater falls through the atmosphere it absorbs co2 creating carbonic acid this slightly acidic rainwater erodes limestone flowing water above or below the surface which had become slightly acidic dissolves the calcium in limestone to form caves this flow forms what is known as a solution cave after the water has receded lower water table pockets andor rooms are formed when the room is formed the rainwater that has percolated through the ground drips off the roof of the cave some of the calcite from the limestone is deposited and this eventually forms a stalactite where it hits the floor of the cave and rises upward it becomes a stalagmite while the majority of caves are formed but not exclusively from limestone and are referred to as solution caves there are other types of caves sea caves are formed by the constant action of waves that wear weaker portions of rocks lining the shores of large lakes and oceans glacier caves are formed by melt water which excavates drainage tunnels through the ice another class of caves formed by frozen water is commonly referred to as ice caves these caves may also be partsolution cave but the ice remains year around the last type of cave is what is known as a lava cave these caves are volcanic and are tunnels or tubes in the lava that form when the outer layer of the lava cools and becomes hard molten lava may continue to flow through the tube and finally exits leaving a hollow tube entrance to the cave caves like the wolf cave and others in this area are definitely solution caves parts of southern virginia and most of tennessee are termed karst topographies the karst environment is one of mostly limestone above and below the surface this limestone is eroded by slightly acidic water and as a result sinkholes sinking creeks and of course caves are formed other rocks such as dolomite and marble can be eroded in the same fashion but limestone is by far the more common rock found in an karst topography limestone was originally living sea organisms the organisms died settled became compacted and over a many million of years formed this light to dark gray rock limestone is primarily calcium carbonate and is termed a sedimentary rock which is one of the three major rock types the other two are metamorphic and igneous rocks speaking of rocks be sure to note the foundation blocks of the building that was erected over the cave entrance note in order for you to claim a find please complete the following 1 post a photo of yourself with your gpsr pointing to

these questions a estimate the width and height of the cave entrance your guess must be within 10 feet if it is a dark day you may want to bring a strong flashlight b what colors do you observe in the cave entrance rocks c what type of rock are the building foundation blocks while they have mentioned several times above best guesses accepted this is the spot we sincerely hope you enjoy this little bit of geology and history on a quiet night some tell of still hearing the howl of wolves coming from deep within the cave we dont advise making your visit after dark besides not being able to see

what you see today which are two openings to caves that border the sink hole feature in the middle parking is located within one hundred feet of the feature a cement walkway is provided that leads people to several observation stands for optimal viewing it is wheelchair accessible all along the upper observation area there are steps down to the walkway that runs alongside the cave openings however it is not necessary to descend to the lower walkway to complete this earthcache there are no access fees or access restrictions all you have to do is get there the site is located less than

southwesterly drive from muscle shoals alabama take us72 west and then natchez trace parkway south when visiting this location do not leave the walkway under no circumstances should you attempt to enter the cave openings the caves are dangerous they contain deep pools into which you could fall also the water is not safe to drink how caves are formed caves are formed in many ways by far the most common way is by the dissolution of sedimentary rock by acidic water that is the process that formed the caves here at cave spring there are other forces that can create caves following are the descriptions of several rainwater by far most of the caves in the world were formed by a process supported by rainwater the rainwater seeps into the soil until it reaches the water table which is where the soil rock or other material is saturated with water the water which has become acidic possibly from various sources eats away at the rock at the bottom of the water table eventually forming channels the larger a channel becomes the more water it holds and the faster this dissolution process progresses typically a cave forms over a period of several million years later the water table can drop leaving the void of the cave and the expansion of the cave channels stops waves over time waves crashing against the base of a cliff can form a sea cave a sea cave forms along a vertical zone of weakness in the rock perhaps a crack or an area of softer rock the erosive power of the waves wear away the rock creating an opening that can deepen and expand with an overhang where the cliff rises above the waves sea caves are typically found in sedimentary rock such as sandstone and limestone they are less commonly formed in hard rock such as granite lava lava which is molten rock on the surface of the earth can create long intricate cave systems when lava flows it typically flows down a slope in a shape that resembles a long skinny tongue the tongue is a channel of flowing lava with the hotter fasterflowing lava in the center of the channel and the cooling lava closer to the edges of the channel the cooling lava on the edges solidifies forming walls and eventually a crust over the top of the lava flow when the eruption stops the remaining lava flows out of the voids and a tubelike cave remains additional lava flows can occur over the top of the cave burying the cave deeper and deeper bacteria there are bacteria that thrive on oil deposits deep within the earth these bacteria which are named extremophiles because they thrive in extreme conditions expel a gas that combines with oxygen to create sulfuric acid this highly corrosive acid eats away at limestone leaving behind gypsum and creating the large voids of caves this bacterial process can feed upon itself with some of the bacteria eating the byproducts and other minerals accelerate the formation of caves manmade the word cave implies a feature created by natural forces therefore there really is no such thing as a manmade cave we have other words to describe the holes that humans have created in the earth humans have dug holes for many reasons including shelter passage mining disposal battle escape etc the cave feature at cave spring is obviously not a sea cave there is not a lot of volcanic activity going on around here either it certainly is not manmade i suppose it is possible that those wacky bacteria could have done it but that just isnt the case here this cave feature was formed by rainwater becoming groundwater getting all acidy and dissolving the rock it was formed by the same process that has formed most of the caves in the world historically the native americans that lived in this area used cave spring as a source for water rock and shelter today however as stated before the water is not safe to drink what you must do to complete this earthcache now on to the tasks that you must complete items you should bring with you include a camera and a pen and paper the tasks

the two cave openings from this small sign answer the following questions in your email to me 1 what is the basic type of rock in this area 2 what two substances combine to form an acid that eventually dissolves that rock 3 do you think that the leaf litter and surface material that becomes trapped in the fissures contributes to the dissolution process and if so in what way this is an open question for which you need to provide your own answertheory ie you have to use your brain and think about it requirement 3 answer question about the cave from the large sign answer the following question in your email to me 1 based on the ground surface and the type of rock involved this cave was a result of what logs not accompanied by email within a reasonable amount of time will be deleted

4961 feet of mapped passages this cave has many interesting features including a large sinkhole entrance a geologically complex twodimensional maze of passages a rich history and several unique species which live only underground robber baron cave probably has an origin related to the edwards aquifer even though the cave is in the austin chalk limestone biological studies have discovered several blind invertebrate species found nowhere else on earth in december 2001 two of these species were listed as endangered by the us fish and wildlife service usfws the cave is also the only one in the county that has been open to the public as a tourist attraction when from 1926 to 1933 an estimated 300000 people toured the cave as san antonio grew the cave became part of a densely urbanized area and subject to problems of vandalism graffiti and unauthorized visitation acquired by tcma in 1995 robber baron is now protected as a karst resource to not only preserve its unique biology geology and history but also to provide a place where people can learn about and experience the underground environment robber baron cave is a maze cave with a complex set of interconnected passages that generally intersect at right angles the cave is found within the austin chalk formation which underlies must of northcentral bexar county the austin chalk is one of the upper confining layers of the edwards aquifer and in the location of the cave is an upthrown fault block it is a soluble formation meaning that water flowing through small cracks can over long stretches of time dissolve the rock in contrast to physical erosion austin chalk is also relatively soft and rather claylike and less soluble in its upper layers it appears that the cave may have formed in two periods the first one of which established the basic layout of passages a second period followed after the cave opened to the surface when runoff played a role in enlarging some passages while partially filling others with sediments there are several theories to explain the origin of the cave its speleogenesis one involves aggressive water flow near locations of constrictions in the main flow floodwater mazes another states that slow and dispersed flow through an upper rock layer that is not soluble could form such caves diffuse recharge recently a new theory has been proposed that explains maze caves as a result of ascending transverse speleogenesis in this theory water from an underlying aquifer is hydraulically forced up into overlying beds of rock the water then travels horizontally through fractures in this bed for long distances along multiple paths if fractures that are differently oriented exist in the overlying bed the water may be forced up into these and form crossing passages characteristic features of this theory of speleogenesis are the presence of small orificelike feeders which are small rounded ear canal like openings in the floors of passages along with cupolas which appear as a series of small domes in the ceilings of these passages robber baron has numerous such feeders and cupolas and local conditions make the other theories unlikely the cave maintains a near constant temperature of 6870 degrees f although this may sound pleasant the relative humidity is near 100 which leaves no place for sweat to evaporate air flow in this cave as with most caves is dependent on local barometric conditions as air pressure falls such as from a passing storm the lower pressure outside will draw air out of the cave causing a breeze in passages toward the entrance during periods of rising pressure the reverse is true some small passages deep inside the cave also exhibit airflow indicating the presence of cave passages beyond that which are known one of the main features of the cave is the presence of significant amounts of carbon dioxide co2 in certain parts of the cave known as bad air these areas tend to be in cutoff or lower sections of the cave where circulation is less and where co2 which is heavier than air can pool co2 levels generally seem to be worse in the summer months than the winter more frequent pressure changes from cold fronts along with a greater temperature differential may combine to help flush out the co2 in winter during the summer some portions of the cave may be problematic to enter as the high co2 levels can result in extreme shortness of breath even when not moving along with dizziness and disorientation these symptoms disappear quickly when returning to areas near the entrance although a headache may remain after entering an especially bad area one theory regarding the origin of the co2 is that it may arise from chemical reactions of water with the surrounding rock or alternatively that it may be outgassing from lower rock layers within the aquifer the formation and development of caves is known as speleogenesis caves are formed by various geologic processes these may involve a combination of chemical processes erosion from water tectonic forces microorganisms pressure atmospheric influences and even digging most caves are formed in limestone by dissolution speleothems in hall of the mountain king ogof craig a ffynnon south wales solutional caves form in rock that is soluble such as limestone but can also form in other rocks including chalk dolomite marble salt and gypsum the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with h2co3 carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes sinking streams and underground drainage limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation these include flowstones stalactites stalagmites helictites draperies soda straws and columns these secondary mineral deposits in caves are called speleothems the worlds most spectacularly decorated cave is generally regarded to be lechuguilla cave in new mexico lechuguilla and nearby carlsbad cavern are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave they were formed by h2s hydrogen sulfide gas rising from below where reservoirs of oil give off sulfurous fumes this gas mixes with ground water and forms h2so4 sulfuric acid the acid then dissolves the limestone from below rather than from above by acidic water percolating from the surface karst topography is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite due to subterranean drainage there may be very limited surface water even to the absence of all rivers and lakes many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes or dolines being the most common however distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by glacial debris or confined by a superimposed nonsoluble rock strata some karst regions include thousands of caves even though evidence of caves that are big enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic

it earth science a coal is not technically a mineral because of one of the rules of being a mineral but is a huge part of the geology of our planet coal was formed organically mostly from plant and animal remains that were pressed under tons of pressure for millions of years and became coal there are four general types of coal mined in the us lignite subbituminous bituminous and anthracite lignite has the lowest btu of the four and is mostly used for the generation of electricity it is also the most common type of coal b in general coal forms from the remains of plants which died in prehistoric swamps and wetlands organic plant matter at various stages of decay form peat which under certain pressure time and heat conditions experiences slow rates of bacterial decay and eventually goes on to form coal as peat is buried by sediment and becomes compressed it slowly releases water and other elements contained within it resulting in an increasingly compact and carbon rich substance the natural process converting plant matter to peat may go through different stages first forming lignite then sub bituminous coal bituminous coal and eventually anthracite coal when we mine coal from the earth it may be at any of the above mentioned stages of formation which contain increasing levels of carbon below we examine some of the characteristics of each rank lignite lignite coal is the lowest ranked coal for its heat energy producing capability and carbon content a soft brownish coal lignite contains the highest levels of moisture of the coal types and is known for its crumbly texture lignite deposits are the youngest of the coal types and have undergone the lowest intensity of heat and pressure sub bituminous with higher carbon content and thus a higher heating value than lignite sub bituminous and bituminous coal collectively make up the majority of coal produced in the united states sub bituminous coal contains less water and is therefore harder than lignite facilitating easier transportation and storage the relatively low sulfur content in sub bituminous coal makes it an attractive option for power plants bituminous estimated to be between 100 and 300 million years old bituminous coal makes up the majority of coal mined in the us bituminous coal is heavily utilized for energy in power plants and for the production of steel anthracite having the highest concentration of carbon anthracite is also the hardest coal anthracite coal is known to be the cleanest burning coal but is one of the rarest being found mainly in limited reserves in pennsylvania local geology you can tell from the earth science above that this area in a geology timeline is younger than that of pennsylvania because of the different kind of coal that is found here lignite verses the anthracite found in pennsylvania c coal fired generating plants produce approximately 75 of all the electrical energy we use from the coordinates look sw about 230 degrees and you

forgotten caves of the mother lode long known to native americans the cave has also had a convoluted history of use by euroamericans and was the site of one of the first cave dives in the united states the cave consists of a collapse sinkhole in marble nearly 100 feet in both diameter and depth with a small pool at its bottom formerly a bower of maple trees partly canopied this large roofless chamber several short decorated passages can be reached by exciting climbs up the walls an enormous submerged passage only accessible by cave diving leads over 800 feet into the hillside bordering the merced river dropping to at least 240 feet deep the cave continues inward and downward but to follow it would require extreme cave diving expertise the early human history of the bower cave area has been difficult to unravel at least 3500 years ago the area was occupied by people who roamed both the great central valley and the sierra nevada foothills these folks were truly the first california cavers burying their dead in many other mother lode caves while we know little about their culture they probably viewed the cave as a portal to the otherworld it is likely that they explored the cave but left no evidence of their passing the northern mewuk arrived in the area about 1200 years ago though the tribe feared caves they called this one ootins and considered it to be one of the places from which humans emerged into the world the recent history of bower cave began just after the gold rush of 1849 on march 19 1851 a miner known only as shore went looking for lost horses and reported finding a large spring in a lime deposit along the north fork of the merced river he also mentioned that he found and explored a very remarkable cave in the ledge christening it marble springs cave jeannicolas perlot a belgian gold seeker may have found the cave at about the same time but his remembrance of dates is somewhat suspect lacking modern vertical gear shore shinnied down one of the immense maple trees covering the outer vault as the collapse sinkhole was called aprons and notches the speleogens of bower cave the southeast wall of bower caves outer vault has an outstanding record of the caves geologic history on display faint traces of the originally horizontal bedding of the paleozoic age marble are visible as nearly vertical bands along the overhanging part of this wall their skewed and folded orientation reflects the nearly quarter billion years of inexorable tectonic forces crumpling the rocks of the sierra nevada along the west coast of california stacked notches vertical walls and aprons reflect the slowly and sometimes not so slowly dropping ground water that dissolved out this huge cavern the older overhanging walls record a steady enlargement as the ground water began to drain from the caves uppermost chamber we now call the outer vault sections of vertical wall are the result of steady lowering of the ground water narrow horizontal slots reflect short stops in the waters withdrawal allowing deeper lateral solution of the marble the lower walls are made of several narrow and one very wide aprons formed as the water fell at a rapidly increasing rate probably caused by entrenchment of the adjacent merced river and solution slowly waned the massive dripstone in the background frames the entrance to the bat roost a domed room now reoccupied by pale

the upper left of this photograph a relic of years long past mosses ferns green algae and a host of other moistureloving plants cover the walls and floor during the wet winter season a long series of owners many immigrant frenchmen and germans subsequently bought commercially developed and sold the cave over the next 100 years nearly everyone suspected the cave extended underwater but only brief glimpses were possible of a darkened hole leading down through the pellucid waters but in march 1953 jon lindbergh son of charles lindbergh the first transatlantic flyer brought some new fangled aqualung gear to bower cave jon studied at stanford university and had used scuba equipment for several years hed met ray desassure and other members of the now nearmythical stanford grotto there and was persuaded to visit bower cave although the use of scuba was beginning to be common in open water diving few dared enter caves jon lindberghs dive was the first cave dive in the west and came shortly after the first us cave dive in florida in late 1951 donning his thin frogman suit and single air tank he dove into the frigid waters of the cave swimming under a natural bridge of jagged ceiling pendants jon swam into the cave some 39 ft then gradually descended nearly 121 ft to a mudcovered breakdown floor then followed his air bubbles up about 65 feet into a blackened void breaking the waters surface he found himself in a large chamber some 46 ft in diameter and nearly 60 ft high unfortunately without any beach or landing spot the domed ceiling rose up out of sight some 20 feet above the pool a high ledge was festooned with white stalactites flowstone and draperies jon paddled around a bit then chilled by the 50of water returned to the outer vault the organizers were delighted and newspapers ballyhooed his dives across california on later dives jon along with sterling pierce of the western speleological institute explored inwards for nearly 350 ft to a depth of

falls are within 100 yards of parking limestone caves about 500 million years ago all of the continents as we know them now were one supercontinent called pangaea see picture below during this period much of north america was covered by an ocean when the sea creatures died their shells bones and coral settled to the bottom forming limestone ooze this ooze eventually turned into a rock called the metaline limestone about 70 million years ago as mountains were forming this rock was folded and uplifted and during this process it developed cracks and voids to form a limestone cave water must be present above the limestone as in a stream rains or in this case mostly glaciers limestone will dissolve in acid such as the acid formed when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide mostly from seeping through the soil even though carbonic or sulfuric acid is a weak solution when it seeps into the ground and limestone over millions of years it will cause small cracks to enlarge as the limestone is carried away in solution this process will enlarge the cracks and then produce larger and larger voids if the source of water is a stream it may disappear above ground and find an exit through the limestone downhill the erosion of both the acids and water will carve out large passages huge caverns see below speleothems speleothems are natures special effects to a hole in the ground water seeping through the ground and cracks in a limestone caves surrounding bedrock may dissolve certain compounds usually calcite and aragonite both calcium carbonate or gypsum calcium sulfate the rate depends on the amount of carbon dioxide held in solution on temperature and on other factors such as the vegetation above the cave when the solution reaches an airfilled cave a discharge of carbon dioxide may alter the waters ability to hold these minerals in solution causing its solutes to precipitate or seep over time which may span tens of thousands of years the accumulation of these precipitates may form speleothems speleothems are the shapes and forms that you will see in a limestone cave which are made up of precipitate of minerals each cave you tour will have a claim to fame about something special about their cave to make it special or unique here is a classification of speleothems dripstone since mineral rich water is dripping into the cave from the roof stalactites may form stalactites hang down from the roof of the cave and the water dripping on the floor below the stalactite may form a stalagmite given enough time they will grow towards each other until they touch and become a column gardner cave has one of the best and unique column i have seen in any cave sometimes a basin is formed is formed in the top of a stalagmite or the floor of the cave pearls can be found in some basin and are round deposits that look like pearls soda straws are formed when the drip of water and calcite is deposited on the outside of the drip the following drips go down the center of the straw or tube making them longer and longer sometimes the water dripping from the ceiling onto the floor will not form a stalagmite but will splash on the floor and creates ridges which will trap the water into rimstone pools bacon is formed when the drips follows a horizontal path before it falls remember these formations may take hundreds of thousand years to form and the color of the speleothems may change because of what the water dissolves and holds in suspension as it reaches the cave flowstone when water does not drip but flows across the ceiling walls and floors of the cave and forms features it is called flowstone these flowstones create many shapes textures and colors in the feature it is like looking at clouds you may find all sort of shapesyou are only limited to your imagination as to what you see i took a picture of a formation and when i got home i could not believe it it looked like a sleeping seal pup being watched by two weasels with neck collars see below it also depends on your angle of view and lighting kids love to make up things and are better than adults at it and they see many more some of your questions will ask you about these features of the cave that will be pointed out by the guide so know your questions curtains or draperies are massive walls of flowstone tens of feet across from ceiling to floor sometimes they look like pipes of an organ look at the floor and you will see waves on the floor created by the water flowing over it caves are classified by being alive or dead a live cave still has water entering into it during all or part of the year and the creation and building of the formations is still going on a dead cave is a dry cave and there is no formation building even though a cave is classified as dead it can still have spectacular formations to experience if climate changes dry cave may turn wet and a wet dry and through the eons both may have changed many times i never pass a cave if they have a tour and i always come away awed by what i see and experience gardner cave is classified as a young cave in age and even though the tour is less than 900 feet it is loaded with features you would only find in longer caves since gardner cave is a living cave be very careful not to touch any of the formations as you may break part of a formation oil in your skin can cause a change in the color and the water will flow around the oil spot and can change the shape even a piece of lint floating around and landing on a formation may change the shape one of the problems we face with nature is how to enjoy it without harming and changing it and caves are no exception so look but do not touch earthcaches are educational in nature and i hope you look at the pictures and read some of the references to get a better understanding of caves just google caves and you will even get a listing of caves with tours south of butte montana is lewis and clark cave which would make a weekend getaway if you head south

of canyons on the precipitous east face of the inyo mountains were reached only by trails occasional springs were the only source of water and they were few and far apart in some instances the flow was enough to create running streams in the canyons before being lost in the thirsty gravel such places were blessed with streamside trees willow cottonwood or even oak as a whole however wood was extremely scarce except for a fair amount of pinyon at higher elevations and a fringe of bristlecone and limber pine on the peaks most of the important requirements for mine production were scare or missing but the gold was there so hardy miners appeared on the scene and proceeded to overcome the obstacles the keynot group of seven claims on the ridge north of keynot canyon made the record for the greatest production in the district it also had the most extensive development including seven tunnels from 150 to 750 feet long its deepest mine went down 1800 feet ore was carried three miles by pack mules to a fivestamp mill in beveridge canyon formerly hahns canyon in later years a tramway was built this amazing accomplishment of transporting heavy mill machinery so far by trail paid off in savings of costs for carrying ore beveridge camp below the junction of cave and beveridge canyons was and still is by far the most inaccessible of the mining camps of the inyos hence it has had few visitors since it was abandoned and shortage of water along the route makes the trail a difficult one according the bureau of mines records the keynot mine was founded in 1878 and operated continuously through 1883 then intermittently until 1906 there was some exploration work done in 1937 but no ore was processed in 1983 the far west exploration company flew in by helicopter a 250 ton cyanide gold recovery plant and began mining the dump a large bulldozer was also brought in by helicopter piece by piece and assembled on site where it remains today the operations were suspended later in that year when it was determined that insufficient water resources were available to sustain operations under the licenses the company was granted keynot mine consisted of four quartz monzonite veins these veins were as thick as 5 feet averaging 21 feet in thickness the veins branch and are segmented by the numerous faults in the area near the surface the veins are primarily leached drusy quartz with gold at depth the gold occurs as discrete particles and as particles associated with chalcopyrite and pyrite and with small amounts of galena and sphalerite the workings of the mine totaled more than 10000 feet in thirty underground shafts that followed the veins of ore in addition there were more than 20 small pits and exploratory cuts 9 cabins an air concentrator and a

record it is the earliestlowermost of two sub periods of the carboniferous period lasting from roughly 3589 + 04 to 3232 + 04 million years ago sedimentary sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition of material at the earths surface and within bodies of water sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral andor organic particles detritus to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a solution particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment before being deposited sediment was formed by weathering and erosion in a source area and then transported to the place of deposition by water wind ice mass movement or glaciers stratification stratification refers to the way sediment layers are stacked over each other crossbedding is a feature that occurs at various scales and is observed in conglomerates and sandstones it reflects the transport of gravel and sand by currents that flow over the sediment surface eg in a river channel ripple marks are produced by flowing water or wave action sideview of current rippled sandstone note coin for scale the crossbeds or more accurately crosslaminae are inclined to the right thus the water was flowing from left to right karst topography karst topography is a geological formation shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite subterranean drainage may limit surface water with few to no rivers or lakes many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes being the most common however distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by glacial debris or confined by one or more superimposed nonsoluble rock strata some karst regions include thousands of caves although evidence of caves large enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst how caves form cave formation begins when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it falls through the atmosphere rain water must have carbon dioxide to become acidic it must be acidic to chemically react to the limestone bedrock rainwater is absorbed by the soil into the ground as rainwater comes through the soil it absorbs more carbon dioxide that is being produced by plants that are dead this changes the ground water to a weaker form of carbonic acid h2o + co2 = h2co3 as it travels down through the ground it comes to solid rock when the rock is limestone or dolomite caves can form the water reacts chemically with limestone and slowly a larger and larger space will form this happens because the rocks are made of calcium carbonate caco3 this is what you call chemical erosion as the space becomes larger and larger the water can flow through as it flows it erodes physical erosion washes away rock and sand this is what makes a cave larger and forms an underground stream finally over hundreds of thousands of years or even millions of years the cave is formed sinkhole a sinkhole it is a natural depression in the earths surface caused by erosion water seeps into cracks in the bedrock and erodes away at it over time the cracks get bigger and bigger and soon a cave is formed size of the cave below is not important just know that its down there a sinkhole starts to become visible when the ground starts to sink lower than the surrounding ground sometimes this can happen in an instant and sometimes this can happen slowly over a long period of time logging requirements do not post answers in your log send the

standards and other policies visiting a sand and gravel mine is highly restricted at this location you have the opportunity to see a sand and gravel mine in operation without being on mining property this earthcache is located on a well maintained county rd in buffalo county the sand and gravel mine overlook is located on kea west rd south of yanney park in kearney ne the natural overlook is a result of an i80 overpass as the road ramps up to go over i80 one has a spectacular view of an active sand and gravel mine you are not on mining property from this overlook you can see a sand and gravel mine in operation you are on public property and no permission is required for you to enjoy this vista and learn about the sand and gravel mining rarely can you get this close to one of these mines and observe the full operation of the mine please park in the nearby public area ne of the coordinates and walk to the overlook location there is considerable truck traffic during the business hours of the mine so it is best not to park on the shoulder of kea west rd there is no sign to indicate this is a mine overlook geology of sand and gravel mining the use of sand and gravel as a commodity falls into two separate categories some is used in construction where it may be mixed with other materials or used as is the second use is industrial where the sand and gravel are used in some way in the production of other materials because so much sand and gravel is consumed in each category the united states geological survey usgs keeps track of sand and gravel consumption in these two separate categories sand whether it is found on beaches or in rivers and streams is mostly quartz silicon dioxide sio2 grains the weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains in the process of weathering the softer weaker minerals in granite such as feldspar are weathered away the more resistant quartz eventually is ground down in size but does not break down chemically in time these quartz grains accumulate in rivers streams deltas and on beaches grains of other weatheringresistant minerals such as garnet rutile ruby sapphire zircon etc are often found in quartz sand as well for some applications it is the silica content quartz of sand that makes it so valuable the silica itself is needed to make products such as glass in addition the physical properties of sand particularly its abrasive property make it useful for traction on icy roadways and railroads and for sandblasting sand and gravel are mined in various waysmostly as open pits along ancient rivers these deposits form as river channels change with the sand and gravel particles left behind in the old bed for example the susquehanna river in upstate new york has several gravel pits as does the platte river valley in nebraska both contain thick gravel deposits left over from rivers that flowed through the areas before the ice ages some 10000 years ago the sand and gravel in these areas are mined in generally the same way first the vegetation and top soil are cleared to form a pit because the water table is so close to the surface near the river the pit fills with water becoming what is called a sandpit lake the pit is then dredged with machines that extract the sand gravel and water the slurry is then sent to a separator that sorts the sand and gravel according to size with each different size used for specific applications the geology of the platte river source of sand and gravel mining the platte river near kearney can trace its evolution through geologic time the central elements are the platte river channels islands and bottomlands which are flanked by terraces that step up away from the river to the north and south significant other elements of the landscape are eolian sand and loess deposits the strata of this land area is made up of gravel sand silt and clay beds from the ground surface to the top of the subsurface tertiary ogallala group or cretaceous formations the sequence consists of pliocene pleistocene and holoceneage strata that document the deposition of a veneer of alluvium by late tertiary and quaternary streams intermixed with and overlain by windblown loess various isopleth and structure maps illustrate the distribution and alluvial architecture of the sedimentary sequence and support the interpretation of former positions of the platte river a regionalscale study consisted of documenting the geologic history of the front range and adjacent mountains and depositional areas east of the mountains in colorado wyoming kansas and nebraska from the end of the cretaceous period about 65 million years ago to the present the structural and sedimentary history of the region is outlined and a series of paleogeographic maps shows the development of the drainage system in the eastcentral rocky mountains and adjacent plains ancestral south platte north platte and laramie rivers are recognized as early as the late eocene although the south platte probably flowed to the southeast from the mountain front at that time deposits of the north platte river are recognized on the west side of the medicine bow mountains of wyoming in the miocene and the presence of distinctive rock clasts indicates that the laramie river flowed from the north park area of colorado northeast across a filled laramie basin and the laramie range of southeastern wyoming in the miocene the present drainage system developed in the late miocene to the pliocene and included the capture and diversion of the south platte river into its present channel the combined north and south platte rivers deposited gravel and sand across nebraska and flowed southeast from kearney nebraska through the middle to late pleistocene within the past 25000 years the platte river below kearney was captured and diverted into its present course and confined there by bounding valley walls of loess requirements for logging 1 observe the mining operation how old is the

gravel mining continue reading how sand and gravel mining works sand and gravel mining industry when rocks erode out of the rocky mountains and are carried downstream by streams and rivers they break apart making sand and gravel the sand and gravel settles out of the water and form the river bed as the river channel moves across the landscape the sand and gravel aggregate deposits are left behind in the platte river valley these deposits can be greater than 150 feet deep and often contain mammoth bones and teeth bison bones and petrified wood sand and gravel mining or aggregate mining is an important part of nebraskas economy sand and gravel have a variety of uses including road building construction concrete production landscaping glass manufacturing sand casting in iron and steel foundries snow and ice control petroleum extraction once an aggregate deposit is found the first step in extracting the sand and gravel is to clear the surface of vegetation and topsoil and dig a pit since the water table is so close to the surface in nebraska the pit fills with water and forms a lake a dredge is placed in the lake to extract the aggregate from the pit the material is then carried by running water to a separator which separates the material by particle size different applications require different particle sizes but typically more fine sand is produced than can be sold this excess sand is pumped back to the lake through a discharge or slurry pipe forming the sandy nesting areas used by terns and plovers in areas where most of the natural nesting habitat has been lost on the river eg the central and lower platte rivers sand and gravel mines play an important role in the conservation of terns and plovers after all of the usable aggregate has been extracted from a deposit and the mine is taken out of production the land is sometimes reclaimed as agricultural land but more often the sandpit lakes are developed into lake shore housing developments creating unique

outskirts of mount shasta the tube is roughly 190000 years old which is quite old for a lava tube as they normally collapse quickly in geological terms having ceilings only a few metres thick however plutos cave is located in a semiarid climate where erosion is restricted which contributes to its survival the cave was first explored in 1863 by nelson cash who came upon it while looking for stray cattle he named it plutos cave after pluto the greek god of the underworld evidence was found of its use by precolumbian peoples visitors can safely hike into the cave about 1200 feet 350 m formation of a lava tube lava tubes are a type of lava cave formed when an active lowviscosity lava flow develops a continuous and hard crust which thickens and forms a roof above the stillflowing lava stream tubes form in one of two ways by the crusting over of lava channels and from pahoehoe flows where the lava is moving under the surface lava usually leaves the point of eruption in channels these channels tend to stay very hot as their surroundings cool this means they slowly develop walls around them as the surrounding lava cools andor as the channel melts its way deeper these channels can get deep enough to crust over forming an insulating tube that keeps the lava molten and serves as a conduit for the flowing lava these types of lava tubes tend to be closer to the lava eruption point further away from the eruption point lava can flow in an unchanneled fanlike manner as it leaves its source which is usually another lava tube leading back to the eruption point called pahoehoe flows these areas of surfacemoving lava cool forming either a smooth or rough ropy surface the lava continues to flow this way until it begins to block its source at this point the subsurface lava is still hot enough to break out at a point and from this point the lava begins as a new source lava flows from the previous source to this breakout point as the surrounding lava of the pahoehoe flow cools this forms an underground channel that becomes a lava tube whether the tube is formed in a channel close to the eruption site or is formed within a pahoehoe flow when an eruption ceases temporarily halts or changes direction the flowing lava can drain out of the tube forming a lava tube cave plutos cave plutos cave was formed by an eruption of basaltic lava originating from a vent of mount shasta about 8 miles away between deer mountain and the whaleback this lava flow reaches as far as grenada this lava tube is one of the main feeder tubes which carried most of the lava into shasta valley the small domes of lava on the surface in the vicinity of the main entrance to the cave are called schollendomes and were formed when the tube was filled with lava to the point where fluid pressure caused an actual inflation of the flow causing it to rise up bulge outward and form the small domes on the surface plutos cave is unusual in that the diameter of this cave is exceptionally large larger than many of the major caves in the hawaiian islands the large holes in the ceiling of the cave along its length are known as skylights and were formed as the lava cooled and the ceiling of the tube collapsed in places entrance to plutos cave solid as rock fragile as glass caves have special sensitive ecosystems a variety of rare or endangered plants and animals are some of the more significant resources in caves important wildlife and vegetation are found near cave entrances while the interiors are known to support a wide variety of life such as mammals reptiles birds insects and microorganisms recent research suggests caves with their unique and varied strains of microorganisms may offer cure to some of the diseases afflicting humans caves are delicate and must be used wisely to avoid damage unlike the surface environment which in time can heal its wounds a cave once damaged remains that way forever for this reason visitors are encouraged to stay on established trails eat and drink outside of the cave no human waste plan ahead there is a forest service restroom at the waypoint nearest restroom 65 miles as the crow flies from the parking coordinates no fires torches or smoking in the cave treat the cave with respect refrain from vandalism enjoy rocks animals flowers and vegetation but collect only litter camp only in designated areas camping is not permitted at plutos cave it is a day use only area are you prepared always go caving with at least one other person each explorer should carry at least two flashlights cavers often carry a third emergency light source to help answer question 6 one of your flashlights should be at least 200 lumens expect to get a little dirty you will be scrambling over rocks at times and some areas of the

park however took its name from the mountains near the confluence of the etowah river and stamp creek center of the large antebellum iron industry district in bartow county georgia iron furnaces drove local economies first in habersham county bartow county and dade county they existed in large cities and many small ones throughout the state of georgia the iron used to create the furnaces and fences for residents and presses boilers and mills for businesses in many instances also came from nearby producers early history of the iron ore industry first of the southern ironbelts to be developed were in south carolina north of camden starting just before the american revolution within 30 years many these iron mills had ceased production because of the inferior quality of iron produced two ironmakers adam carruth and elias earle however opened ironworks in spartanburg and cherokee county by the start of the war of 1812 carruth had an armory and a federal contract earle received a federal contract for guns in 1816 a contract he was unable to fulfill which ended his business venture carruth continued to produce iron through 1822 when he ran into trouble with his federal contract earle had eyed the abundant mineral wealth of the cherokee nation to support a furnace and from 1807 he began promoting his idea of building a furnace in indian country earle wanted a piece of land 6 miles square that had an ore bed and water when he sent men to build a furnace near the confluence of chickamauga creek and the tennessee river they were turned around near taylors crossroads catoosa county the state of tennessee then held up ratification of the treaty giving earle the land and earles plan collapsed jacob stroup jacob stroup raised and commanded a regiment in the war of 1812 in 1815 ironmaking moved to cowpens when edward fewell and jacob stroup built an ironworks lying on both sides of kings creek at dulins old mill stroup and fewell spent $200000 on the purchase which they improved until fewell died in 1822 stroup married fewells wife after his death stroup sometimes misspelled as stroop would soon become wellknown to georgians stroup founded the kings mountain iron company which operated from 1822 to 1830 when a flash flood caused an explosion in the furnace stroup called in his son moses to rebuild the plant while he began working on the cherokee iron works on the broad river in 1826 but he sold the company before 1830 to ernor graham graham renamed the company the south carolina iron manufacturing company while dahlonega and auraria are the best known georgia gold rush towns clarkesville in habersham county and gainesville in hall county also saw significant growth after the 1828 discovery of gold when jacob stroup first set up the stroup iron works in 1831 the town had machine shops four lawyers a confectionery shop two churches three taverns and a brewery by 1835 stroup was having financial problems and interested john c calhoun in investing in his business on the banks of the soque about this time ironmaster jacob stroup brought his son moses into the business as an ironmaker according to ariel sherwoods georgia gazetteer stroups iron works were three miles out of town on the soque river and consisted of a forge and furnace and various workshops to consume that part of the iron which is not sold in bars and castings sherwood gave his production of iron as 25 tons and 60 tons of castings in the year of the panic of 1837 in 1839 the state exempted all employees of stroups iron works in habersham county from serving on jury duty jarvis van buren nephew of martin van buren and founded of habersham countys apple crop joined the stroup iron works as a manager there were many names for the iron works including stroups iron foundry and habersham iron works and manufacturing company moses stroup moses lived in lincoln county north carolina until he joined jacob at the iron works near clarkesville but by the time moses arrived both men were looking west to expand their business in 1837 they journeyed to the new city of cartersville in the former cherokee nation partly to take advantage of the building the western and atlantic railroad and partly because of the rich iron belt associated with the cartersville fault the date of the stroups move to cartersville is based on the sale of the site of the stamp creek furnace from jesse lamberth to alexander stroup son of jacob brother of moses on january 25 1837 alexander conveyed the title to jacob on may 11 1837 jacob and moses establish the first furnace a bloomery on stamp creek that year known as etowah bloomary this forge was replaced in 1841 by etowah bloomary forge no 2 moses stroup ran the etowah works on the stamp river until 1843 when the mill and surrounding land was sold to mark anthony cooper generally known as major cooper who had lost the race for governor earlier in the year at the time the western and atlantic railroad was starting to grade north of the etowah river moses stroup would continue to be involved in georgia production of iron until 1847 mark anthony cooper major cooper was a politician and one of the early organizers of the western and atlantic railroad he purchased stroups etowah bloomary on stamp creek in 1843 and moses stroup continued to work with him to show him how to process iron in 1847 cooper and stroup planned on moving to the etowah river to be closer to the railroad timberland and the iron ore from red top mountain they enlisted a third partner merchant leroy wylie for additional financial backing moses stroup was not able to come up with the money needed so wylie and cooper bought his share the etowah rolling mill was established in 1849 and located just over a mile from coopers allatoona furnace this mill had 9 furnaces with rolling trains nail machines and a hammer all driven by water power in 1856 the plant produced 900 tons of pig iron mostly from 2 open cut mines in the allatoona iron belt along the western and atlantic railroad and other cuts in the wheeler ore bank cooper and wylie established the city of etowah around a blast furnace that still stands today the town had a 175 mile short line railroad to etowah station on the western and atlantic railroad and numerous businesses associated with iron production such as a rolling mill at its height the city of etowah may have had a population of 800 people because of its ability to produce iron the city was a major target during william tecumseh shermans atlanta campaign general jacob cox took the city as temporary commander of the xxiii corps army of the ohio on may26 1864 after a brief battle the city was never rebuilt robert cravenscravens was born in rockingham county virginia and spent most of his childhood in selma alabama and tennessee his uncle george gordon owned the bright hope furnace and let young robert cravens become his partner in 1826 cravens built a furnace on whites creek in rhea county tennessee shortly after becoming gordons partner in 1837 robert cravens moved down whites creek to its confluence with the tennessee river and built eagle furnace which produced highquality iron that was used throughout northwest georgia northeast alabama and southeast tennessee the furnaces at this location were so successful early on that cravens built a canal from the tennessee river to eagle furnace however the panic of 1837 and resulting depression forced robert cravens to close eagle furnace bluff furnace was completed in 1856 owned by the east tennessee iron manufacturing company came online with robert cravens the only principal partner with practical iron experience east of rosss landing the furnace could use both rail and boats to bring in the raw materials to create iron and the furnace flourished until the civil war to overlook his iron empire cravens built the cravens house which figured prominently in the battle of lookout mountain joseph fighting joe hookers men swept across the outcrop craven chose to build his house only to be driven back by a counterattack by edmund pettus the yankees regrouped and took the plateau the changing iron industry in 1869 the bessemer converter was introduce into america and americas iron furnaces concentrated on producing pig iron the form of iron required to make steel most georgia iron was never considered to be high grade with the exception of the dyestone belt as steel production ramped up georgia iron production decreased and by 1875 all furnaces in georgia with the exception of those using dyestone belt iron in extreme northwest had ceased production iron ore continued to be mined in georgia through the early 20th century within a hundred years the bessemer process was considered obsolete types of iron ore ochre soft iron ochre is most commonly used as a coloring agent for masonry products it is the only iron ore currently mined in the county not for iron production but for making pigments by the new

it is often reddish in fact its name is from a greek word meaning bloodlike bartow countys hematite is primarily silver gray in color a flaky stone known as specularite although an iron ore little of bartows hematite was used for iron production limonite brown iron ore over the years bartow county has produced some six million tons of brown iron ore the common name for limonite and goethite outside of bartow limonite is found mainly in austria and england slag slag was the waste product of iron production limestone or some other flux was added to the iron ore to draw out the impurities in the furnace the molten iron sank to the bottom while the impurities being lighter rose to the top where they could be scooped out as this waste hardened it formed slag which varies in color and

cracks in the limestone slowly dissolving the rock and enlarging the crevice the runoff descends to the water table the level of whatever river or lake is closest as the acidic water moves to the river or lake it dissolves more limestone widening the underground channel and drawing in more ground water with it in time a main horizontal underground stream is formed with pools and tributaries floyd county is located in the ridge and valley geological region the eastern part of the county is located in the great appalachian valley section of the ridge and valley geological province it contains multiple strata of paleozoic sedimentary rocks deposited when eastern north america was flooded by the ancient iapetus ocean dolomitic limestone limestone sandstone mudstone and shale are the dominant rock formations of the county caves are common in the county when the city of rome was first founded settlers found native american burials carved into the mudstone cliffs along the etowah river all the artifacts and skeletons associated with these burials have disappeared from public view it is not known which native american culture excavated the tombs stalactites softpedia news the carbon dioxide dissolved in the rain water droplets and attacks the limestone rock which is made mostly of calcium carbonate caco3 or calcite as a product of this reaction the newly formed chemical is cahco32 also called calcium hydrogen carbonate an extremely water soluble compound while on the roof of the caves bicarbonate filled water is filtered the carbon dioxide is released and the resulting calcium carbonate precipitates the newly precipitated calcium carbonate starts forming concretions around the falling point of the droplets towards the caves floor a stalactite starts with a tiny ring of calcite deposited by the falling water droplets in time the deposits build a very narrow 05 mm hollow tube called soda straw stalactite which can be very long but easy to break further calcite deposits left by water build the typical coneshaped stalactite this is an extremely slow process as a stalactite requires millions of years to form it is estimated that the growth rhythm of the stalactites is about 25 cm 1 in in 40005000 years the tag caver the earliest recorded description of the cave is from adiel sherwoods 1837 edition of a gazetteer of the state of georgia the gazetteer included an article copied from a rome newspaper dated january 15th 1837 and was signed wkb in the description it says the county presents one and only one natural curiosity that has been discovered and it is a subterranean cave in the lower part of vauns valley about 15 miles from this place rome it is situated on the summit of a lofty eminence and the visitor before he untakes the ascent may refresh himself with a rich draft of pure limestone water which issues from the base of the hill in a stream sufficiently large to supply all the water power necessary for the successful operation of a whole manufacturing village in newengland it has been documented that native americans inhabited the area prior to settlers and they called it talalah which means place of sunshine in the mid 1820s settlers of english scottishirish ancestry came to the area and established it as a town these settlers left the homes of their families in middle georgia the carolinas and virginia to find a place of their own in northwest georgia what they found was an area they would soon come to call cave spring the settlers chose the area because of the abundant water source and its surpassing beauty what they did not know is that the spring flowing out of the cave is fed by an underground aquifer that expels 23 million gallons of water every day the settlers found the area around the cave so delightful they began to build churches schools houses surrounding it they also made the area immediately surrounding the cave into a park for all the people to enjoy its temperature is a constant 57degree

near where spring exits the earth and remember the whole point of this game is to have fun and explore first we start with hydrogeology hydrogeology that deals with the movement and distribution of groundwater within the rocks of the earths crust such as in aquifers a spring is any natural situation where water flows from an aquifer to the earths surface it is a component of the hydrosphere aquifers in georgia an aquifer is an underground layer of waterbearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials such as gravel clay silt or sand from which groundwater is contained and transmitted groundwater makes up about twenty percent of the earths fresh water supply groundwater is water located beneath the ground surface in voids or fractures of underground layers of rock a unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water the depth at which fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table groundwater is naturally replenished by surface water from streams rivers and precipitation and eventually flows to the surface naturally when it reaches the water table this natural discharge often results in springs springs indians and early settlers were known to depend on the crystal clear waters of cave springs many local folks stop by and fill containers with the water of the spring springs are a small part of the water cycle basically the water of our earth constantly evolves and is moving through a series of changes cave springs is part of that cycle the cycle of water the largest springs like cave springs are formed in limestone and dolomite in the karst topography of the region definition of karst a landscape characterized by the presence of caves springs sinkholes and losing streams created as groundwater dissolves soluble rock such as limestone or dolomite karst cross section limestone fracture relatively easily when weak carbonic acid formed by rainwater and carbon dioxide enters these fractures it dissolves bedrock please note the limestone formation above cave springs with several fractures when it reaches a horizontal crack crevice or a layer of nondissolving rock such as sandstone or shale it begins to cut sideways as the process continues the water hollows out more rock eventually creating airspaces the largest of which are known as caves or caverns this process usually takes thousands of years to complete when the spring surfaces gravity takes over and as with all streams the flow is downhill<<font> spring location spring location is related to geologic structure and topography in the valley and ridge province many springs are located on or near anticlinal anticlinal definition inclining in opposite directions from a central axisaxes and around the noses of plunging anticlines open tension fractures tend to be concentrated in these places and in the case of plunging anticlines wateryielding beds may drain in the direction of plunge the bases of sandstone ridges are in general the sites of major springs cave springs like other larger springs tend to be in valleys and some form the headwaters of streams an example of water flow with a spring formation water flow amount the amount of water that flows from springs depends on many factors including the size of the caverns within the rocks the water pressure in the aquifer the size of the spring basin and the amount of rainfall springs are classified by the volume of the water they discharge the largest springs are called firstmagnitude defined as springs that discharge water at a rate of at least 100 cubic feet of water per second down to eighth magnitude where less than one pint per minute flows zero magnitude is reserved for past sites with no current flow 1st magnitude > 100 cubic feet per second 2nd magnitude 10 100 cubic feet per second 3rd magnitude 1 10 cubic feet per second 4th magnitude 100 gallons per minute 1 cubic feet per second 5th magnitude 10 to 100 gallons per minute 6th magnitude 1 to 10 gallons per minute 7th magnitude 1 pint per minute to gallons per minute 8th magnitude less than 1 pint per minute 0 magnitude no flow sites of pasthistoric flow types of springs springs are named for how they flow and there are four main types the first type of spring is a gravity spring this is just what it sounds like these form from the pull of gravity the water gets pulled down through the ground until it reaches a layer it cant penetrate because it has nowhere else to go it starts flowing horizontally until it reaches an opening and water comes out as a spring these are usually found along hillsides and cliffs next we have artesian springs which come from pressure in confined aquifers forcing the water to the surface the pressure inside the confined aquifer from being smooshed between those impermeable layers is less than the pressure outside the aquifer so the water moves in that direction any cracks or holes in the land will easily let the water escape seepage spring which as you may have guessed is groundwater seeping out at the surface seepage springs slowly let water out through loose soil or rock and are often found in land depressions or low in valleys finally we have a tubular spring these springs occur in underground cave systems which resemble underground highways these tubes or channels are made of limestone and as water moves through this type of rock it dissolves some of it away tubular springs are some of the largest springs on earth and the tubes themselves can be so small that you cant see them or large enough to walk through history note people for millennia have use the spring with its fresh tasty water pouring out of the limestone mountain the creek indians called it home for a long time before the cherokee tribe drove them out then the settlers drifted into the area and drove the cherokee away cave spring ga this earthcache is the entrance to a cave located in rolater park

built by the steel industry this steel was produced from iron ore and coal mined throughout the area the earliest mining took place in the days before the civil war during the civil war coal was mined to fuel the blast furnaces at tannehill brierfield selma and oxmoor now the site of an industrial park with only a historic plaque remaining to mark this historic location these furnaces produced iron that was used by the confederacy to armor war ships and to produce weaponry such as cannons and as ammunition for these cannons the iron was also used to produce rails for steam locomotives to transport goods to confederate troops the rails laid by confederate forces often led to mining operations where coal and iron ore were mined by slaves and indentured servants it was no simple task to create a railroad system there were no modern tools such as gps and topographical maps to help plan the route to the mines it was backbreaking work to create rail beds trees had to be cut passes through mountains had to be blasted with nitroglycerin and the rubble from the blasting operation had to be removed by hand if the route to a mine encountered a waterway bridges had to be built the bridges that crossed these waterways were marvels of engineering at the time they were built they were constructed of stone that had to be quarried and transported to the site these stones which could weigh thousands of pounds had to be meticulously shaped and fitted to other stones to create pillars and abutments by locating this geocache you will visit one of these historic locations that is known only to a handful of people the site of the geocache is the ruins of a bridge that once led to the gould mine near helena the gould mine was started by uncle billy gould early in the days of the civil war uncle billy acquired 1700 acres of coal land near helena on this land uncle billy sank a shaft onehundred and thirtyfive deep during the highpoint of mining from this shaft workers brought out seventyfive tons of coal a day all of which was shipped to the confederate arsenal and naval foundry at selma things went well for uncle billy gould as he mined coal throughout the civil war until the waning days of the war in april of 1865 days before general robert e lee surrendered at appomattox the union general wilson and his raiders began a march towards the confederate rolling mill located in helena while enroute to the rolling mill wilsons raiders systematically razed everything in their path unfortunately uncle billys coal mine stood between the rolling mill and wilsons raiders after crossing the bridge leading to the mine wilsons raiders burned the bridge and then proceeded to burn threethousand tons of uncle billys coal that was due to be shipped via rail to the naval foundry in selma later that same day wilsons raiders reached helena and proceed to raze the rolling mill in helena it is now 2004 almost 140 years since wilsons raiders put an end to uncle billys coal mine but there are still artifacts to be visited most notably the remains of the bridge that was razed the remaining stone work is a testament to the craftsmanship of these early masons and stoneworkers these masons built something that still stands today even though it is hidden from public view and is well worth a visit here are some pictures of the remains of the bridge that was razed and what you will see when visiting the area where the geocache is located you can click the thumbnail images to see a fullsize picture when visiting the area its easy to imagine the sounds and smells of steam powered locomotives as they crossed this now extinct bridge as you listen to the peaceful sounds of the water as it flows through the area as you explore the area think of the miners engineers and laborers that toiled to create a transportation route for the coal from the mine try to imagine what life must have been like in the area 140 yearsago this may sound crazy but as i visited the area today i closed my eyes and could hear the sounds of steam operated machinery the sounds of the nowdefunct railway and the sounds of workers speaking amongst themselves visiting the area really is like taking a step back in time i think it is so cool to be able to see the old rail bed that is still visible even though many trees now lay in its path even though the cache container is prettymuch run of the mill its a 30 caliber ammo can reaching the cache is not the typical geocache experience and i consider it to be part of the adventure as a geocacher you will have to determine the best way to access the geocache you should take some time to study maps this cache is literally located in the middle of nowhere but visiting the area and seeing the artifacts created by our ancestors will make the effort worthwhile this is not a driveby geocache and you need to be prepared to spend some time researching the best way to reach the cache site while hiking to the cache site i had to cross several small streams and work my way through many very thick briar patches i have the bloody scars to prove it you should also be aware that the area where the cache is hidden as well as the areas near it are often used for hunting if visiting the area during hunting season make sure to wear plenty of bright colored clothes as well as a orange hunters safety vest as no geocache is worth getting accidentally shot i am an admitted civil war fanatic and admittedly attempt to learn as much about my hometown area as i can as such i have to give credit where credit is due i originally discovered this very historic site while on a hike with my brother readymixer and his boss keith we actually discovered the bridge abutment on the opposite side of the water from where the geocache is located even though i did not yet know the history of the area i knew that i had to place a geocache in the area in an attempt to allow others to learn the history of the area it took many hours of research to learn the history of the area i would also like to credit mr henry emfinger owner and curator of the aldrich coal mine museum inc for information regarding this historic site the aldrich museum is one of only two mining museums in the state of alabama and is well worth visiting the museum is open from 1pm4pm on sundays and from 10am4pm thursdaysaturday admission to the

lake today called baldwin lake big bear lake would not exist for another 30 years the gold rush of 1849 was fresh ineveryones mind and california was ready for another rush the only passage to the valley was a long and very difficult indian trail up the santa ana canyon and down into the valley originally only placer gold was discovered this is gold that is found in streams these streams would freeze over in the winter and start up again in spring a few hardy miners that stayed through the winter of 1859 named their camp starvation flat the area was soon flooded with prospectors adventurers speculators merchants gamblers and all the others typically drawn to a boom by 1873 bear valley and the surrounding areas had been well searched and staked out finding a new and profitable claim was becoming difficult at best two hardluck miners brothers charley and barney carter were were looking for exactly that when they discovered gold on the ridge of a mountain just east of holcomb valley in july of 1873 they filed four claims on this ridge two of were called the rainbow and moonlight mines in december of that year they sold these on what was now called carters mountain claims to elias lucky baldwin a multimillionare who made his fortune in nevada silver mining initial surveyor reports had stated that the goldquartz ore ran two miles across the mountain from west to east ranging in width from 50 to 100 feet and as high as 85 feet one local paper reported that the crown of the mountain is a mass of gold bearing rock baldwin was pouring money in the mine on now what was called gold mountain by the end of 1874 he had 150 miners working the claims the ore they mined was being stockpiled for processing in the stamp mill he was building see 1875 stamp mill cache a 5mile flume was constructed by chinese laborers to supply water for the mill see flume tunnel cache chinese laborers were also cutting roads from the mine northeast to cactus flat forest road 3n61and west to holcomb valley forest road 3n16 a road was also constructed that ran down to bairdstown see doble cache it all came together in march of 1875 the mine was being worked by 180 miners the roads were open and the 40stamp mill started operation the boom lasted 2 months the quality of the ore was nowhere near expectations and 20 of the forty stamps at the mill were shut down in may by november of 1875 the mine and mill had ceased operations the mill was used to process ore from other mines in the summer of 1876 and then closed the mine remained idle for the next 17 years in 1893 budd doble baldwins soninlaw invested $25000 of his own money to start up the mine the quality of the ore remained low and the mine was closed again in 1895 in 1899 captain j r lamar tried his luck at the mine he belived that he could recover a profitable amount of gold from the ore using a new technolgy this was to use cyanide to dissolve the gold in the ore and recover it from the cyanide he constructed a new 40stamp mill since the original mill had burned to the ground in 1878 see 1900 stamp mill cache his run lasted until 1903 from then on series of people tried to make a profit from the mine the final attempt was just after world war ii this time a ball mill was set up just below the mine the remains of the timbers which supported the hopper that fed ore to the mill are still there though it appears that it will colaspe at any moment the ball mill was removed in 1952 the mine never made much of a profit for the people who invested in it except maybe for the carters who sold their claims
