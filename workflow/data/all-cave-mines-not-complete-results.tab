CherryCacher	Found it	1/10/2012	I solved this earlier but thought this would be a perfect time to find it as part of a challenge I was attempting to achieve on my way to SW Ohio to find the oldest remaining Ohio cache.

DLiming	Found it	2/28/2009	Had this one solved for awhile now and tried to find it a couple days ago. My navigator looked for it then, wasn't to comfortable looking for it due to it's location. We went back today and my youngest crew member and myself looked. We found it and had it signed without being noticed I think, but with this location one never knows. I am was not comfortable looking for this one either felt way to exposed. Thanks for the cache. DLiming	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1KDBZ_is-mine-and-i-will-repay
Sommer Family	Found it	2/20/2009	Do you know what it's like to be tormented by your elders? That's what this puzzle did to me. Tormented me. Tortured me. Caused sleepless nights. Woke me up in a cold sweat. Made me question my abilities and caused a mild form of depression. Those are not even the worst / most embarrassing thing that I had happen to me. The final straw was when Col Mustard (upon him finally solving this puzzle) taunted me with this comment: "Never send a boy to do a MAN's job." All in good fun. Great puzzle! Tormenting, but great. A little bonus for me with the final hide location. TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1KDBZ_is-mine-and-i-will-repay

Col Mustard	Found it	2/8/2009	Sometimes you get inspiration from the least expected places. As I was watching TV the last night, and ad came on and provided the connection I needed to break through the log jam. I can't reveal more for it could be a spoiler, but here are some words to ponder: Tolstoy said: The two most powerful warriors are patience and time. Col Mustard said: Old age and trickery will win over youth and skill every time. Col Mustard is old (60+), has a few tricks (check my cache offerings), has time (he's retired), and sometimes is patient, and although Tolstoy is even older, his imposter is youthful, and certainly skilled. Enough said And since you like the childhood games: Tag, Your It !! This a very evil and yet clever puzzle. It was/is challenging. Good luck to those yet attempting it. Congrats to owner on achieving a new found level of evildom. I look forward to more.

Jeepers-gasfree	Found it	12/7/2019	Joyful Noise wanted to go on an adventure, and who am I to stand in her way. (Ok, I drove). Heading down into West Central Indiana to find a waterfall, a cave, and an arch, we digressed into a shameless county run, expending an entire day and an excessive amount of gas. Oh well. Lots of fun anyway. Favorite point for bringing us to an interesting place of local history and geological features. Please see Joyful Noise's replies to the Earthcache questions.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache
Joyful Noise	Found it	12/7/2019	Last night, I told Jeepers-GasFree that I wanted to go for a hike in the woods and find waterfalls and caves. And so we looked up where we could do a day trip and headed south for a day trip. Along the way, we got a cache in every county we drove through (and drove through a few counties just to get a cache!). We also met up with some old friends and, of course, found a waterfall and a cave. This was our cave for the trip. Not sure it was quite a cave... Perhaps more like a cubby. But it was an interesting place and we enjoyed exploring it.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

Team sissifalke	Found it	5/25/2018	Midwest Tour through America After arriving at Cincinnati airport, we‘ve started out trip through mid-west USA Our first stop was at Louisville before we continued towards Evansville, Saint-Louis, Kansas City all the way to Denver- Skyline of the Rocky Mountains. We’ve stayed in Colorado for a couple of days and drove to the Rocky Mountains to Mount Evans and past the beautiful Echo lake. We took the historic steam train in Georgetown to explore the Rocky Mountains – what an unforgettable experience. We’ve visited the open air arena in Red Rock Park and have informed ourselves about the historic and musical past of this area. We soon had to leave beautiful Denver to continue further towards the north Via Golden, Fort Collins, Cheyenne. We’ve took a bit of time to hike through the Toadstoll Geological Park- beautiful hiking destination. We’ve crossed the border to South Dakota and visited the many sights along the way - Hot Springs in the Black Hills, Wind Cave NP, Jewel NP, Grazy Horse NP, Custer-State-Park – we were even able to spot some wild bison’s there. We’ve then continued our tour towards Sylvan lake along the panorama road -“Needles Highway”. This windy road leads to needles past the many pine forests along the way. Continuing further towards the Rushmore National Memorial. We then weren’t far away from rapid city or the city of the presidents where we took part of an impressive sightseeing tour where we got to see 43 bronze statues of all of the US former presidents. We took a quick detour to South Dakota before we continued towards the south towards the Badlands NP – a plateau with edged mountains, deep canyons and steep cliffs – impressive to look at. After we have left the Badlands, we continued towards Mitchell along the Highway 90. We visited the corn place with its special artefacts and paintings made out of corn. The next days are leading us back again towards the east towards Sioux Falls. We saw many sights here for example the Sioux Waterfalls, Old Courthouse etc We went shopping at Spirit lakes before continuing towards Minnesota. We also went shopping in the Bloomington Mall of America. We went for a city stroll in Minneapolis visiting the many parks near the Saint Anthony Falls and the Washburn A Mill. We have visited the cathedral of Saint Paul and the Minnesota State Capitol. We left Minnesota after Saint Paul and have crossed the border to WISCONSIN continuing towards Madison to see the State Capital. We have visited the famous Harley-Davidson-Museum in Milwaukee. We collected a number of Petoskey stones while strolling around north Michigan Lake. These stones are unique to this region. We are now continuing towards Chicago where we will spend a couple of days as well. We’ve done a bit of shopping and got to know about the skyscraper history. The first skyscrapers were built in the 80s and 90s. One of the most impressive ones is the trump tower directly at the Chicago River. The facade mirrors the Wrigley Building and the Chicago Tribune Tower. We then had to say bye to Chicago after a couple of days. We then continued towards Gary (INDIANA) and New Buffalo (Michigan). We have covered 3 states: Eck Michigan, Indiana and Ohio We now have to go back towards Indianapolis where the legendary race took place. We have also planned a visit to the Hall of Fame Museum before going back to Cincinnati. Going to the GIGA event: We have met many friendly cachers and we have talked about our mutual hobbies and our trip in and around Cincinnati. We have covered approx. 4000 miles and have experienced a lot. Everyone was very welcoming and helpful as well. Thank you to all the owners for placing and maintaining the caches. Best greetings from Bavaria Team sissifalke	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

TeamJanine&Jon	Found it	5/24/2018	We are traveling from the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area to the Cincinnati Ohio area to attend Geowoodstock 2018. We have been looking forward to our trip for quite some time, and in anticipation, we solved some geo-mystery caches and identified a lot of non-traditional caches that we would like to find on our trip to Geowoodstock, throughout Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. We left home at about 8:30 AM Milwaukee time, with our friends Hack1of2, and arrived at our hotel at 11:40 PM Kentucky time - so, adjusting for the time zone change, that makes about 14 hours of driving and geocaching. In all cases, the logsheets were signed and the caches were rehidden as we found them. Where Challenge caches were found, we noted that we did qualify for them and one can check our public profile for verification. For Virtual caches and Earthcaches, answers have already been sent to the cache owner and photos have been added to our logs, where required. We enjoyed our stop here. Answers have been sent. We will add a photo to show our caching group at ground zero. Thanks to all of the cache owners for the nice caches and the fun, full day of geocaching!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

Eat the same bagel with cream cheese. Do your commute. Go to your job. Spend the day doing the same job you did yesterday. Punch out. Commute Home. Dinner. TV. Sleep. Do it all again tomorrow. There’s a certain security in a steady schedule, but too much of the same thing gets you stuck in a rut and the monotony can just plain kill you. When was the last time you took a day to do something spontaneous? Have you varied your day to day path by even a little? Break the Monotony Day reminds us that sometimes change is good, and changing our daily routine can really make all the difference. Guess what? Breaking the Monotony Day also falls on International Geocaching Day. So, like every geocacher ever I'm going to use multi-million dollar satellites to find Tupperware in the woods. I knew I was going to be caching today in Indiana. I had a specific D/T I wanted to grab. I woke up early this morning and discovered an International Celebration. Like I say "There's always a cache on the way to a cache if you're not on a timeline". So, I decided to stop by and support the international theme. I ordered Columbian coffee, and Belgium waffles topped with Canadian maple syrup. Well, maybe the syrup wasn't from Canada. Breakfast was good and so were the conversations, then it was on to the cache that brought me here. The good news about caching solo is you can go at your own pace for as long as you want grabbing whatever suits your fancy. The bad news is without a navigator you end up passing up numerous caches. Fueled throughout the day with only a bag of Craisins, an orange Tootsie Pop I found in my car console, and several bottles of water I was able to fill the last space on my D/T grid and start on the next loop. Today's finds included an Event, four EarthCaches, two Challenge caches, five traditionals, and one Virtual. Three of the caches had changes in the elevation from the parking coordinates which added to the fun. In Northwest Ohio we call changes in elevation an overpass. Not a typical numbers run with only thirteen finds in twenty hours, but today was anything but monotonous, dull, or lacking in variety.

thekingofbattle	Found it	7/16/2017	Ugh...I'm "forced" to give this EC a favorite point...I love history...so by pairing an EC with a bit of history...well, FP awarded. Really though, I enjoyed working on this EC...brought me to a place that I might not really go to (despite being connected with a historical event). Most likely, I would have driven down the highway, not knowing that this event happened at this location. It was dusk though, so I had to hurry to collect the needed information (which has already been sent)...but I did have the place to myself...always a bonus!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

Our primary focus on the way there will be Virtual Caches, Earthcaches, Wherigo caches, Unknown Challenges and some favorite caches. After doing the virtual and earthcache at Tippecanoe Battlefield, Mrs Seadog noticed these side by side earthcaches on our way back to the highway. After walking up the hill to find the spring we ended up at the cave to finish the Spring earthcache and then do this neat cave earthcache.

CherokeeSarah	Found it	10/15/2016	Pretty slick climb today. I will email you our answers. Out today trying to do a road trip up north. I say "trying" because we got waylaid by traffic congestion from Franklin through Indianapolis. We may not make it nearly as far north as we had hoped. The weather has cleared off to be very nice right at the moment. We have also wasted a bunch of time trying to find the entrance to Prophetstown State Park. We decided to grab a few nearby, so as not to waste the entire day. Today is day #491 of my geostreak. My goal is set on day #500. So Lord willing and the creek don't rise I should be able to make it. Unless otherwise noted the caches are in good shape.

I can never remember	Found it	5/23/2015	Dinotraks and I set out for a weekend of caching in and around Terre Haute, IN with the goal of completing the Back Home Again in Indiana geo-art as well as grabbing as many other non-traditional caches and counties as possible. After learning a lot about the history of the area from the Tippecanoe Monument, we had to stop here to complete the loop of knowledge. This is a really cool cave and the history tied to this area is remarkable - I'm so glad that dinotraks and I had this chance to experience it all. We didn't venture too far into the cave but we did get in far enough to notice a decent change in air temperature - it's much cooler in/around the cave entrance. This cave and bluff reminds me a lot of a place called Council Overhang in Starved Rock State Park near Ottawa, IL which we have visited several times. An email with the necessary information has been sent. Thanks so much for bringing us to these two beautiful (and significant) places!

A few highlights of the day included: Leaving the house at 6:00 AM to start my caching day. Snow glorious snow. Wishing for snowplows Wishing for snowplows to get out of the way. A kids snow shovel Wet frozen feet Lots and lots of laughs, usually at each others expense. Getting home at 11:00 PM after another very long day of caching and a 4 hour drive home.

boydfamily	Found it	8/24/2014	What a really cool spot - it almost gets lost with the Battlefield history nearby. we took a moment to think what it might have looked like back in the day. In our area of Ohio - Greene County - we have a lot of history of Tecumseh - sort of brings the two areas together. Thanks for the earthcache and showing us this area. Our answers have been sent.

solid-rock-seekwells	Found it	8/20/2014	Mr. SRS2 and a co-worker stopped and found this cache after work in Lafayette. My co-worker had heard quite a bit about geocaching from me and enjoyed today's introduction. We ended up finding 7 caches including traditional, earth, virtual, and mystery/challenge caches! We located the cave quickly, took a few pictures, and enjoyed finding the answers to send the CO. The history aspect was also very cool! Thanks for the cache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

Thank you for placing this cache or earthcache .. it brought to an area we would have not otherwise explored!

Odyn	Found it	7/20/2013	Visited this one while on a fantastic 4 day 10 state 2100 mile road trip with Darth Leviosa and psychovw. Our team name for the trip was DarkO Paycho. This was a cool spot to visit, we discussed our answers in some detail took lots of photos and then headed on our way. This was find 1 of 19 for the day. Thank you for the cache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache
Darth Leviosa	Found it	7/20/2013	DarkO Paycho (me, Odyn and psychovw) from northern Chicagoland embarked on an epic 4 day 10 state road trip to collect new states and find quality caches. This was Day 1 which took us from our homes in Lake County, IL to Jackson, OH. Our plan was to meet at my house at 6:45am, pack up the rental Jetta and be on the road by 7:00am. Paycho arrived right on time and parked her cachemobile Sophie in the Leviosa garage next to my cachemobile Django. They would get some well earned rest for the next 4 days. Odyn was running late and showed up a little after 7:00. We loaded up the car, got situated and were on the road by 7:30. Odyn was driving, I was shotgun and Paycho was in the back. This was the first cache on the list. After a couple hours of driving, during which we figured out what the SET button in the glove compartment did and saw some neat clouds and windmills, we arrived at parking. We weren't sure exactly which way to go at first, but quickly figured it out. We almost walked into a giant spider's web. We took some pics of it and carefully walked around it. We arrived at the cave and had fun exploring it, standing on rocks and taking pictures. The formerly dry papers were soaked from the humidity. We had some drops fall on us from the trees too. No one fell. We gathered the info we needed and headed back to the car. We saw the monument for the cave on the way out. It looked like someone started carving my name but stopped. Back in the car, Paycho killed a bug, but not with a slug. Thanks for bringing us to these cool cave. TFTEC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache
psychovw	Found it	7/20/2013	Team DarkO Paycho (Darth Leviosa, Odyn, and myself) from northern Chicagoland is on the prowl to collect new states, oldest caches, different Earthcache types, webcams, virts, Jasmers, and anything of interest over 4 days. This marks day 1, a 3 state adventure through Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. This was our first stop of the trip. We parked at the parking lot and carefully walked around spider webs on the small trail to the cave. It is drizzling out, but the tree coverage is protecting us from any wet doom. We each explored the cave area and nobody fell. It is super humid out and on our way out we saw why this place is called Prophets Rock.

coachstahly	Found it	4/24/2013	TFTEC. Today is the last day of the week where I could have taken a caching trip somewhere, so I chose to focus on Lafayette (and Brookston and Delphi) since there were so many challenges I qualified for. Just my luck to have 38 degree weather on April 24th as well as intermittent snow throughout my time up here today. This was my twelfth stop of the day and my fourth EC. I had managed to clear out the challenges I qualified for north of Lafayette, leaving time for the 5 ECs in the state park area. I did the two in the state park first and then headed over for the one by the monument and then the two here. I remember coming here for a challenge and enjoying the cave but for some reason I was avoiding the ECs so I didn't log it then. I did the required measurements (guesstimates really!) and took a nice picture of me standing near GZ. Email already sent and picture to be uploaded after this log is submitted.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

Rolling north and west today, on our travels headed toward home. Cool spot, and some interesting history here as well... Pretty quiet at this spot today, guess being a Monday may have something to do with that? Looks like some rain is headed our way but right now it is perfect out on the hunt. Enjoy hunting up a good earthcache now and again, they always seem to get me into some cool locations, and this was sure one of them. Thanks for setting this one up and keeping it going.

JustJ	Found it	10/21/2012	Today started a couple weeks ago when I heard the rumor that Turkey Stash Run (Jasmer – November 2000) could possibly be archived at the end of October. Not wanting to miss out on this opportunity, I started talking with Jomber about that cache and the possibility of a day run from Grand Rapids/Holland, Michigan to grab it. He was immediately in. Of course Mi Barrel Makers heard of this and wanted to make the grab here as well. He didn’t need the Nov 2000 square, but wanted the cache and this was a great opportunity for another “J3” day. Our plans revolved around this cache, but of course we also planned for some double and triple fizzy filers, virtuals, earthcaches and wherigos. Our day started before sunrise as we drove south picking up only a few caches, by our standards, until we got to our destination. These two earthcaches were on our hit list today as they were "along our way," or at least enough for the J3 crew. We have a tendancy to get a little sidetracked along these trips. This was an awesome cache as we climbed in, out and around the caves. Good time at a fun earthcache. Thank you Find #4207 since we started caching on August 2, 2010. Found with my Garmin Oregon 450 and Droid Razr MAXX.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache
jomber	Found it	10/21/2012	After hearing about turkey run in Indiana possibly being archived...I knew I had to get ahold of the J3 crew (James, Jason, and Josh-me AKA Mi barrel makers, Spartanalumn, and Jomber)and plan a trip. But how to plan a trip to Indiana and back to Michigan in less than 15 hours?? Well... Decided it would be best to leave at 415am and give us the most time caching in the 2 states. We decided that it was not going to be a numbers day but that it was going to be a grid filler/ calendar filler for us. Started the day off with a bang.... I filled my double fizzy on the first cache that we found. The main goal was obviously to get turkey run stash but also to snag some virtuals and earthcaches along the way. We ended up leaving Holland and worked our way to turkey run and then over to Indy. We ended up biting off more than we could chew since we were planning on going to Fort Wayne but traffic put a stop to that real quick. so had to end the day without getting Indiana's first. However, this cache is not near as far as turkey run. Ended up being a beautiful day outside and I can not believe how lucky on some of the caches we found so quickly. Turkey run park was a very memorable experience and I am glad that I was able to experience this park if this gets taken away. Thanks for all the caches. Signed logs as J3 for our names. Was able to switch out some travelbugs and leave some travel bugs in random caches to add miles. Answers will be emailed shortly	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache
MI Barrel Makers	Found it	10/21/2012	Great day for some caching! Another epic J3 adventure trip day. Today was all about getting down to Turkey Run State Park and of course along the way we could not pass up things that would fill triple Fizzy spots or a virtual or earth cache here and there. Signed logs as "J3" for Jason "Spartan Alum", Josh "Jomber" and myself (Mi Barrel Makers) We started early and as usually had too much planned, get stuck in traffic in Indianapolis which did not help - so our list was cut a bit short and we finally got on the move again to return home late. All in it was a great day with 34 finds and one DNF. But high quality caches with the Turkey Run Park being a true highlight. Getting the old cache there was great but spending some time hiking and doing the earth caches there was even better. What a beautiful area. Enjoyed a chance to stop and explore around this one and the nearby spring. Thans for the excuse to stop and stretch. Caching since August 29, 2010 this was find #6965 for the MI Barrel Makers - The Kuipers, from Grand Rapids, MI	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

Walkabout46	Found it	9/13/2012	Favorite point 4 of the day. Went to the Lafayette area with Team J&K to work on doing some non-traditional caches for a challenge. We had a great time. I vaguely remember being here before my geocaching days so it was nice to return. Email and photo on its way. Thanks for giving me a reason to return to this very cool spot. #3160	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache
Team J&K	Found it	9/13/2012	I am curious - do you read these answers from novices like us and wonder how we ever come up with the answers? In our case we always use my height (6') and Jerry and Judie (Walkabout46) base everything on that. In other words, they use me as a ruler. At least I contribute in some way. And we laugh a lot which doesn't help our answers but it does make it fun. Here's our answers for this one: 1. Height 18 - 20 ft and 35 feet wide. 2. OK - I tried my best to figure out "passages" in this cave. There is maybe one that goes back 10 feet or so that I could see but I didn't crawl any further back in there to see if it continued on. However, it would take a MUCH smaller person than any of us to get into that hole. 3. This was dry BUT its very dry this year. My guess is this is not normally dry so it would still be growing. 4. The ceiling is rougher pebbles. I posted a pic of me with my log. Thanks - Karen	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

GryllsGyrl	Found it	7/1/2012	Caching the day away with my friends scultstroop. I love caves and learning about history, so this cache was a treat. When we first arrrived, a storm was rolling in and a warning came over the radio, so we left and hightailed it to a nearby Wendy's. Thankfully, by the time we ate lunch the weather had cleared to make another attempt. I got confused as to which cache we were doing and ended up having everyone walk up the hill unnecessarily , but eventually we found the cave and it was worth it. Thanks for a great earthcache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

GwynEvie	Found it	6/24/2012	We visited this historic site before the EC was established and finally got a chance to return and gather answers for the cache. The kids had a fun time climbing around on the formations.

Dropcache Rusty	Found it	4/21/2012	In the past, we have always logged our caches "Lucky Chavez." Now we have two accounts, since we seem to have different caching schedules lately. From now on, when we are out together we will log caches as DR Chavez. I apologize for copy/ paste logs the next few days as I catch up on backlogging to get my account current with our finds. This was our 500th milestone, and you'll see the pic of our son holding up our "Lucky Chavez" sign in my wife's log. Thanks so much for having this here, it was such a great day soaking up our Nation's history.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC256FJ_prophets-rock-cave-earthcache

Il n'était pas au courant de la permission qui vous avait été accordé. Il est maintenant au courant et on lui a montré où était la cache en lui disant qu'il se pourrait qu'il voit d'autres gens s'y rendre éventuellement.

Je suis content de l'avoir enfin vu de proche. Je crois que le gardien connaît bien le jeu. Quand je suis arrivé, il était sur son perron et quand il m'a vu sortir avec le GPS, il m'a dit « Sais-tu où elle est?" Pas de problème je vais la trouver que je lui ai répondu... En passant, je crois que sur les logs de toutes les caches que j’ai faites aujourd'hui, j'ai écrit le 21 comme date. J'en fume du bon, je ne sais pas où j'avais la tête...

Infonovy	Found it	11/25/2009	Premier à trouver (PAT). Mais pas évident: j'emprunte le seul chemin carossable et me retrouve à cette 'Mine Richmond Division Francoeur' mais à peine à 3.1km de la rue principale du village de Arntfield. Me serais-je trompé? J'ai fais une lecture avec 3m de marge d'erreur: 48° 12. 433 79° 17.533 contre l'original qui est: 48° 17.433 79° 19.532. Qui fait erreur? Il existe un autre embranchement nommé avenue Chartier carossable sur 0,6km, mais il reste 10.5kn à faire dans un sentier en pleine forêt dont j'ai fait une partie il y a un mois et ce n'est pas très facile, surtout pour plus de 10 km. Expliquez-moi l'erreur! First to find (FTF). Yes but not sure at all: I drove the only car road possible to end at the said 'Mine Richmond Div. Francoeur' but only after a ride of 3.1km from rue principale in the village of Arntfield. Am I wrong? I made a gps mark with an error factor of only 3m: 48° 12. 433 79° 17.533 and the original is: 48° 17.433 79° 19.532. Which is wrong? There is an other road on the right named avenue Chartier which can be reasonably done by car for 0,6km, the remaining 10.5km consist of a quite rough forest trail of which I made a good part a month ago and it's not so easy, especialy if you're speaking of more than 10km.

This was night #1 of the hazing/qualification process for induction of a few new members. I have confidence they'll make it as I have been tortured by them at length in Florida (in their devious hides and by caching with them). Thanks! We were bummed that the cave is now inaccessible. It was on our list - night or not!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
wimseyguy	Found it	7/2/2004	It's after midnight now, but for me the caching date begins when I get out of bed, and ends when I go to sleep. Found nightstyle as Team CHB returns to Cacheville for Geowoodstock2. Just had to go out the night before and find a few before taking a nap.

Scoot the Frog	Found it	4/17/2004	Found after the CITO event with the gang. I love 5/5 caches.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
robertlipe	Found it	4/17/2004	After a day of serious power caching (a couple of caches before the Ci/To event, a hugely successfully event where we gathered about two dumpsters of junk, and then continuing to cache until about 2:30 a.m. or so) the Monkeymobile was in the area. "No way am I returning to that hellhole" said a few, but some of us still needed more adventure. "Go without us" they said. Well, we'd been hunting with lights for several hours anyway, so why is a cave really any different? Fortunately for us, most of the native life was asleep so we were able to do our busines and move along with minimal drama. (For a beer, I'll tell you which of us was the most scared...)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
rippietoe	Found it	4/17/2004	Like R0b said, happy not to do this one alone!! Hanging and caching with the gang after the CITO event. I was also happy there was plenty of guys with us, I let them do all the hard work and then signed the log!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
r0b	Found it	4/17/2004	Found it along with the rest of the gang after the C.I.T.O. event. I sure am glad I wasn't stupid enough to try this one alone!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
ds04428	Write note	4/12/2004	I would like to differ with the fact there are no snakes there. I don't know what kind you have here but I saw the biggest wild snake I have ever seen here. If it was stretched out it would have been about 4 feet long. I'm leaving this for another time.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
sketty	Found it	4/4/2004	Got it but it was an ordeal. After climbing, sliding, and crawling I entered the cave. I went deep enough in that the only light I could see was my flashlight. I kept going deeper and deeper. I did some caving in my younger years and one of the rules we used was to have three sources of light. I thought of this, as my only light source kept flickering on and off. I knew it was time to turn around and get out. That was when I heard it. It sounded like a baby's cry deep in the cave. Now I don't know what kind of animal makes that kind of noise but it sent chill's down my back. Again my light went out. I was in pitch black!! Again the cry. Was it closer this time??? I banged my flashlight and it finally came back on. I set a record for low crawling out of a cave. I left the cave swearing that under no circumstances would I ever return to Dead Man's Cave. By the way why is it called Dead Man's Cave?	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
Bulli the Wonder Dog	Found it	3/31/2004	Found this one with a crowd of folks one night. I was a little spooked about the idea of going into a cave at night but AbbysGrammy assured me it would be OK because we were in great company. There were several cell phones with us plus one paramedic so figured we had all bases covered. I even put on my blinking lights around my collar since I wasn't able to hold a flashlight. I literally had to pull AbbysGrammy down into that cave but it was all worth it-what a sight!!!! The roughest part for me was trying to full NashvilleJoe back up after we slipped. Some days are really tough on a fella.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
AbbysGrammy	Found it	3/31/2004	Now I said, "no, I'm not going down in a cave even if it IS with MonkeyBrad and others" but I was forced. I hung onto Bulli the Wonder Dog for support and put my "pogo" stick into high gear and I made it. Bull and I were the first ones back out-don't know why it took so long for the others.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
Monkeybrad	Found it	3/31/2004	What do you do with a big man and a little cave? Two words, Kentucky Jelly. On the way back out I felt like Big Bad John, holding up that rock on my shoulders, needless to say this big man does not lie at the bottom of this cave, but the next finders will have to go through an even tighter squeeze than we did. Gorilla Freedom Finders are in a Jimmy Dean Song...	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
NashvilleJoe	Found it	3/31/2004	Glad to have found this one with a Geo-herd! Kept the cave monsters at bay! Let's just say that the ups and the downs of this one are unreal!!! The attached picture may be a total spoiler because it shows the location of the container of the cache on the GPS and the background scene behind the container. (Sorry for the give-away, Bubbajar!) My only comment is that NEVER again will I get on a slippery trail like this one between AbbysGrammy and MonkeyBrad. Bulli the Wonder Dog was a life-saver when he dug us out after the roof collapsed!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
Moses	Found it	3/31/2004	Glad I was with the most prolific cacher in the world on this one. We were all outfitted with our headlamps (even bulli)and needed them all to spot this bad boy at night deep in the cave. Found no bodies but did find a benchmark nearby, two finds in one. Thanks for the adventure.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
CCCooperAgency	Found it	3/31/2004	All i can say is that i thought we might have to send Bulli the Wonder Dog for help (with a note tied around his neck)...after this one, i was all tuckered out for the evening. #33 of Day #3.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
bubbajarr	Write note	3/28/2004	WARNING!! Do not try to get to the cave by water. A friend of mine tried to tie-off his boat by the rocks and the waves from the barges going down the river, pushed his boat into the rocks and cracked his hull. Enter from the road and watch for cars. The road has curves and cars may not see you by the road.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
Southpaw	Found it	3/26/2004	First of all, Murrcat and sis have the home advantage, second, why do I follow Joe into these places, I ought to know better by now. If he had let me lead, we wouldn't have fallen so far (I'm a little more than 5 lbs. larger), would and did stop sooner. Just another lesson learned the hard way. Again don't try the right side.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
JoGPS	Found it	3/26/2004	Southpaw and I took off the afternoon to go after this here cache, we were thinking that if SIS and Murcat ( no offence girls ) did it we could, but we have been wrong before, we didn’t think that they had been playing here since they were little girls and knew all about the cave and where to crawl and where not to but we did find out the hard way DO NOT crawl on the right side of the cave there is a pit and if I had weighted five lbs less would have fallen to the bottom but got stuck instead so beware. The cache was done very well Thanks for doing it…………JOE PS what do cave rats looks like if they never go outside remind me to tell ya’ll later	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
bubbajarr	Write note	3/22/2004	Assigned geocoin to this cache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
sis	Write note	3/20/2004	"brother" tb visited your cache and found monsters lurking nearby. he chased the danger away leaving courage in his wake. when you get to "deadman's", you will find courage because "brother" left it there. "brother" left with murrcat and sis.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
bubbajarr	Write note	3/20/2004	I received the new geocoin today to give as the prize for the "Deadman's Cave" contest. Remember those who feel they cannot physically do a 5 star hunt can still try it. Just enter a description of how far you got. Have fun!!!

Murrcat	Found it	3/20/2004	I saw this cache page come up a few days ago and thought, " Wow, bubbajar hid a cache in Deadman's Cave!". I've heard stories about Deadman's Cave all my life, but I never actually visited the site until a couple of years ago. And then I only stood outside the entrance. There was no way I was going inside this locally famous cave.......Until today.........I called Sis to go with me because you should have someone with you when you search for this cache. Or at the very least, let someone know where you are going and when you expect to return. I was totally prepared. We went this morning before the predicted rain hits this afternoon. I wore some old clothes that I wasn't worried about ruining completely and got to use the neat head lamp I bought over a year ago and have never had the opportunity to use. I'm not going to tell much more about my adventure into Deadman's Cave, for fear of giving away exactly how the cache is hidden but I will say that maybe they should have named it Fatman's Squeeze. I was really filthy and dirty when I came out and only got a little bit wet. It's easy to stay out of the water as long as it hasn't rained in a while. I agree with the difficulty and terrain levels, it's not easy finding a micro cache in a cave. Good Job, Bubbajar! I hope you draw my name out of the hat.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHYEN_deadmans-cave
sis	Found it	3/18/2004	i went to the stated coordinates with the intentions of consficating this cache. the session will be meeting to determine what steps to take concerning the trespassing of the cache owner as well as other parties attempting this feat. a camera is set up to watch all comers. meanwhile, i have left this cache in place in all fairness since the final determination has not been made. i have talked to the approver who has agreed to wait until we make our determination. keep in mind, this cache is treacherous. you are putting your life in your own hands while attempting this cache. we take absolutely no responsibility for your safety. serious sis update 3.19.04 the session has approved admittance to the cache location as "members only". as i told them about geocaching, i explained our "cache in trash out" policy and pointed out the fact that it was members only. they have benevolently agreed that geocachers may be welcomed. let me point out though, this cache is extremely dangerous. any attempt is purely your responsibility. beware...and enjoy. udate 3.28.04 they found a deadman near the cache. channel 4 was there.

Sammy Eliza	Needs Maintenance	8/15/2016	We really enjoyed finding this as we were just adventuring the mine and found it, did not know there was one in there as we do not have service up here. The log book was absolutely soaked but it was still a great experience.

the hiking viking	Found it	5/28/2010	Got a surprise extra day off from work this fine Friday so Frenchie invited me to cache with her during her lunch hour since she still had to work. Neener. Just dropped her back off at work after grabbing lunch and 3 caches. I still have some time so I'm grabbing some more caches in the area, this being one of them. Got to the cache site quick enough and as I was crossing the water something jumped into the water to my left, something big. Couldn't put my eye on it so on to the cache I went. Found cache, put it back, then walked quietly back to the creek to see if I could spot what was in there. And I did see it.... A giant northern water snake. Was huge! I actually tried to catch it, to take his picture but he was having nothing of that, very skitterish, couldn't get close. Too bad, he was a beauty.

flyfish1	Found it	12/2/2009	Out caching on a dreary, drizzly, day. From the direction that I approached, I need to make a stream crossing. There was a very shallow portion of the stream where I decided NOT to cross, because it was wide and I didn't see any way to get across without getting my feet wet. So, I went down to another part of the stream where there were some large rocks I could use. Well to make a story short, the water was MUCH deeper where the rocks were located, the rocks were wet because it was raining, and go figure... I ended up in water over my knees. After getting across I found the cache without a problem, but didn't have a pen to sign the log. I had one in my back pocket when I left the car, so the pen evidently ended up in the creek. To top it off, the cache didn't have a pen in it, which was unfortunate, because it had enough room to store about 100 pens. Oh well... I had to laugh and say to myself "now that's real geocaching". Being that I was already soaked, I didn't even look for a dry way back across the stream... just walked right through the part that was only ankle deep. All in all, it was a lot of fun.

Nottinghams	Found it	3/23/2009	Well, this time the Chipotle Ladies managed to turn a relatively easy hide into a "grand trek".

OhHappyDay930	Found it	3/21/2009	My young accomplice and I were successful in finding the hideout, although we were delayed by filling up our trash bag because no other rescuers or troll allies made a dent in what was there, is STILL there. The coords were right on and my helper was eager to set someone free, but he got all confused and then negative when he saw they all looked the same. He isn't that eager to find the poor lil' thing a new home, but I'm actually looking forward to it. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1NVXV_rock-wood-cave-trolls

cerberus1	Archive	3/30/2008	I guess that each new generation finds this area as "their" hang-out spot... Micro WAS still there (which no one really found anyway :) , but the cache was laying only 5' straight in, exposed. I'm archiving this one. If kids ARE gonna be around here often, replacing the cache every-other weekend ( IS gettin' warmer...) would be cost prohibitive. Go 4 It, please write in as a "find", since your log and discription of contents were accurate. Anyone wishing to claim this area for a cache, feel free.

windsorhill5	Found it	3/18/2008	Only had the coords - no description. so I didn't even know there were two parts. Went in looking in all the drill holes and cracks for a micro, which is most of what I have been finding here. Shock when I found an ammo can! Lots of bats, covered completly in dew drops. Great cache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill
rca120	Found it	12/29/2007	This one was fun!! themorts was trying to find the film canister were I did not want to be. Once I thought I saw it I had to get down and dirty.

themorts	Found it	12/29/2007	We read the warning about doing this one in the winter and opted to check it out anyway - and I'm SO glad we did. This was a great cache! RCA120 and I had a blast just looking for the film canister. RCA thought he saw it, but if he did it got lost in the shuffle as I was searching. We did find something else however. Then we found the final stage and the cache.... and the bats! TNLN, TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill
Woodlit	Found it	12/29/2007	Between the rain last night, and the melting snow, I swear there was rapids on the river today. It was strong enough to carry my 3 D CELL Maglight downriver 20 feet. Thats right, I dropped it right in the drink by accident. After it got caught up on some branches in the water, I was able to pull it close with a stick, and make the grab by hand. And true to the Mag name, it still works great. I've been in many tunnels, caves, mines, shafts, adits, etc, but this is only the second one that had bats in it. Little tiny guys, that looked almost white. Was able to get in and out twice without disrupting them. Great cache, had a good time!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill
unimoggers	Found it	11/11/2007	#1901, in the morning: Had the day to myself again caching and listening to a Crusades series. May I just say how much I hate caves? I kept taking pictures of something that seemed to be lurking inside. It didn't respond when I threw a stick at it. Now I know why there are so many sticks in the cave. I should have tossed some out for the next batch of finders. Anyway, I had no flashlight (tsk tsk) but was able to illuminate the cache with the light of my GPSr. I really need to pack one of those lightweight flashlights in my fanny pack. Left a TB and T a few pictures, SL/TFT$™. MommieMogger solo (ahhhh...) BTW, I never did find the first part of the cache. I guess we really didn't need it.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill
catolee	Found it	10/21/2007	Awesome hide! I never knew this little park was even there! We did not find the first part either because we found the cave while trying to find part one!

The K-Team	Found it	9/24/2007	After being sick in bed and on the couch for two days, I needed to get out. I dragged the hubby along hoping he would be the one to get this one. Nope it was me, he was too big to climb in so even though I was a little creeped out I made the find for us. Proud of myself for that one! I also must be hanging with WT way too much because on the way out I started climbing up the steep hill with Jeff right behind me instead of taking the easier way. Thanks for the fun.

walnut-tripper	Found it	8/23/2007	Hi Beau & Carly! I finally found the time for this cache. I guess I held off b/c I thought I was going to be filthy for the rest of the day. When you go at night for a handful, it's not that bad. I will say that this cache was the first one I physically had to go into a cave. Some are like right outside it and stuff, but this one you had to just do it. When I got to the cave entrance, my flashlight was acting up. Still not sure if it is shorted or the batteries are dying. Once I got it working, I went to the back of the cave & backtracked. Lost light again and fiddled with the flashlight for a minute until it cooperated. Found the cahce right away, SL, took the geocoin, and dropped off a Hickory Run State Park map. Didn't have much time to dilly-dally due to the flashlight, but all in all, I had a great time! I would definitely recommend this cache!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill

Poconoaks	Found it	8/5/2007	This cache was awesome!! We didn't have a flashlight on our first attempt. Wasn't sure about going in without being able to see. About 2 hrs. later we went back with our trusty light and found the cache easily. Great location. Do not recommend going with flip flops. This is a mandatory shoe, sneaker or boot cache. We left a TB, coin, pencil and bracelet. Took geotag and coin. Almost forgot to add we did find the first stage and its not where you think! ;P	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill

Tyson Sprandel	Found it	6/25/2007	I really liked this one! A bit puzzled as the coordinates took me right to the cave. No first stage?

cigar cache	Found it	6/24/2007	Great cache. Never did find the first stage, but while looking for it found the cave. Great place to cool off for a little while.

unimoggers	Write note	6/23/2007	Well, it was 8:30 when I finally made it here today. But maybe I can talk some friends into coming tomorrow. There's an open house across the street tomorrow. We'll see what we can cram into one day.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill
Clancy's Crew West	Found it	6/17/2007	Well, if this wasn't the coolest cache we've done in a while, I don't know what is! Even Clancy joined us for the final on this one. (And she'd been in the creek, so was a "joy" to be next to!) We really enjoyed it. I had planned on introducing some friends to geocaching, and think this one might be a good place to start. BTW; we, like others, did not find the first stage--although we found the spot we think it probably was hidden in. Might need to check stage one. Anyway, TFTC!

Clancy's Crew	Found it	6/17/2007	We decided to grab a few caches on our way to drop Clancy's Crew West off at Brainerd; and this was one of them. What a great area; what a fun cave!

Stellar Jr.	Found it	6/8/2007	We had a great time looking for this geocache. I had a chance to wade in the creek and then we found a cable hanging from a tree. I got to swing across the creek a few times on it. Going in the cave was spooky at first, but once I got in there, it was neat. We found the cache easily and we both signed the logbook. I took the Signal geocoin. We left some stuff too. This was a fun cache to find. Just a warning to anyone else, you might get real dirty here. Thanks for the fun adventure!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill
stellarscapes	Found it	6/8/2007	WOW ! What a fun adventure we had here. I saw when this cache first came up and wanted to do it that morning, but at 7:15 AM, I was on a bus with a bunch of screaming 6th graders on our way to Hershey Park for the day. We finally had time today to come here and attempt the cache. We too ended up on the wrong side of the river at first and had to go back around. We got to within 60-70 feet of GZ and saw that it was quite a steep hill down. We carefully made our way down and searched for part 1 but couldn't find it. Seeing that someone else found it without Part 1, we decided to continue walking down the trail. We walked another 600 feet or so until we couldn't go anymore. Saw what looked like a big rocky hill across the creek, maybe that was it? So, hiking boots and all, we just jumped in the creek and walked across. The cold water felt great in the hot 91 degree temperature. We searched around the other side and came up empty, so we walked back across the creek again and went back to the original location that we were searching. Stellar Jr. found a cable and ended up swinging on it over the creek a few times. I continued on searching the area and ended up finding the cave. We both crawled down into the cave and found the cache easily. It was nice and cool in there - I didn't want to leave. We only had one flashlight, so we had to share it. It was really interesting in there. Took the geocoin and a few things. Left a geocoin, some GW5 peep geocoins and something else. Had a great time! This cache is definitely one of our favorites so far. Thanks Cerberus1 for the Great Adventure!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill

Jasper Ralph 13	Found it	6/3/2007	Beautiful area here! We choose the trail on the wrong side of the creek at first before realizing where we should be. Monte1984 arrived as we were repowering our flashlight. Nice to meet and talk with you Monte1984! Neat cave, appears man-made, wonder why and what was here. Had a laugh when we found stage one after stage two. Nicely stocked cache, wish we had trade items. Actually returned again later in the day to retrieve the flashlight we left behind. Thanks for the fun!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill

T:Diabetes TB - L:N - S:L Did not get out as early as expected Jeep4x4girl was helping some newfoundlands in their water training skills; so we had to make a stop back at the house for dry clothes. We havn't been able to get out for a while, between work, surgery and MommaBot foot problems, but we tried to pick an easy few to get back into it. Never did find Stage 1, but decided to try the cave (Which I never knew was here) Snapped on the LED headlamps and crawled through. I didn't realize we'd be able to stand up. Found it quickly.

Shuecrew	Found it	5/28/2007	Okay well first of all, anyone who does this on their way to work, in their dress clothes, needs to have their head examined. (not mentioning any names - KEITH). Second of all, this is my first real cave. (can I say that I've "spelunked" now?). Let's just say that I'm more stubborn then squimish, but it's close. The girlie sounds I made doing this and the "get it off me dance" I did when I emerged were embarrassing. VERY. Good thing I was alone. TN Left Diabetes TB.

back2school	Found it	5/26/2007	With a gorgeous afternoon and a long weekend ahead we just had to hit the caching trail. Our afternoon began with a stop at Buddy's Hotdogs in Saylorsburg and then we were off. We did our all time best with 12 searches & 10 finds today. We found one of our most creative finds and definetely one of our most adventurous .... we found a World Geocoin, set a TB free, and were a STF. Our caching day ended well after the sunset with dinner at the Wind Gap Diner. What a great day to spend out together - enjoying each others company, the sights & hunting together. This was #8 out of 10 finds. To date - THIS IS OUR MOST ADVENTUROUS FIND. We were also excited to see we were STF! The entrance is being guarded by a lizard - so watch yourself. Mr. Back2School ventured inside while Mrs. Back2School gave directions from the safety of the outside .... of course! Mr. Back2School kept saying .... "come in, it's great!" - but just couldn't bring myself to do it! What Fun .... we have to bring Emtranger out here to make this find! This was GREAT! TFTH!

keithj999	Found it	5/24/2007	I have a meeting this afternoon in NYC and was wearing my dressy cloths, but decided to at least check this out. Ran into a group of fisherman on the way in and choose the wrong side of the river. Backtracked to the other side and realized this wasn't the type of cache to do in good cloths. Found a way down and was amazed I didn't fall. Lost reception but the landmark was easy to spot. Found what I was looking for and turned on the flashlight. The only good thing I was thinking was I left the sport coat in the car. Backed in and only rubbed the top of the opening once. A quick search revealed the prize. Signed the log and took the FTF Prize, thanks. Climbed back out and hit the same spot, either its lower than it looks or my butt is bigger than I realize. Back up the slope and thanks to a couple handholds didn't fall. Got to the car and broke out the handywipes. Checked my rear in the mirror and there's one 6 inch spot that will be covered nicely by the sports coat. What a person will do for a FTF. Thanks for a great cache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13437_the-cave-at-old-mill
