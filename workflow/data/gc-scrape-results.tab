JustPlainPhil	Found it	1/22/2020	Jan 22, 2020 12:50 PM 8480 The last time I was here was for a FTF effort with Vinyrd and didn't know the EC was here. This morning, I decided to make sure I got it while I'm staying here a bit of extra time. This afternoon, I made the short trip over and circled the complex. Having been in prison ministry for 8 years, I enjoy finding caches involving or near them. This must have been one bad hell hole to be in. Unfortunately, it's closed this time of year, but exploring the perimeter was still pretty kool.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EX8_old-newgate-mine
schwandt	Found it	11/20/2019	I had a midday business meeting in Hartford today so I took advantage of the travel to do a little caching along the way and then set myself up for attending the November CCC event in Waterbury in the evening. I started a little later than I could have - and the drizzly, overcast weather was not the most supportive of getting outside, so I found a few less than I might have. However, I still recorded over five miles of hiking and tracked down almost two dozen finds, with most of those being non-traditional caches. In fact, it ended up as a "busy" day with traditional, unknown, multi, Wherigo, virtual, Earthcache and event finds. This is a very interesting location to visit. I had the place to myself today, but I would be intrigued by being able to visit when all of the locations were accessible. A message has been sent with my responses. Thanks for the learning opportunity of this Earthcache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EX8_old-newgate-mine
PhotoRoamer	Found it	10/13/2019	I was pleasantly surprised to find this park was open and not closed for renovations, as the cache page indicated. I took the tour through the mine and did the self-tour around the prison grounds. Interesting place and a bit creepy too, not only due to the decorations for the park's Halloween festivities but learning about the prison history housing inmates in the mine. I have sent the required information to the CO. Thanks for the geology and history lesson! Cheers ~PhotoRoamer	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EX8_old-newgate-mine
gpscouts	Found it	10/13/2019	Visited the prison buildings and the mine ! The half hour tour was well worth the time. Neat to combine a historical cache with an earthcache.

And Sister	Found it	8/12/2018	I've wanted to visit Old Newgate Prison for years, but never had the opportunity, because it has been closed to visitors for so long. I was delighted to learn that it was reopening to the public this summer. I was interested in the history of it as well as the geocache. I got to enjoy both aspects of the site today, not only because I got to tour the grounds and the mine, but also because it was one of the days that the Theater Guild of Simsbury was there to present a short one-act play that gives some background on the history of the prison and some of the people (prisoners, warden, and reformer) who were so much a part of its story. I'm a little biased, because I know the author/director and most of the actors, but I highly recommend setting aside an extra half hour for this entertaining and informative play. If you can't make it to the last live show this summer, you can see it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVEww4MUw_A ("Tales from the Dungeon"). While I very much enjoyed the opportunity to go into the mine and see what it was like, I would most certainly not have enjoyed being incarcerated there! It was refreshing to duck out of the heat and cool down in the 50 degree temperature for a few minutes, but it didn't take any imagination at all to understand how uncomfortable and unpleasant it must have been to have spent weeks, months, and years underground in the damp, dark, and cold as a prisoner,or even as a miner who got to leave at the end of the day. And it was more than a little chilling to hear one of the guides mention that there are still bodies buried under some of the rock fall where tunnels collapsed. In short, it's an interesting place to visit, but I'm glad mine was voluntary and short, and not at a judge's discretion!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EX8_old-newgate-mine
outsiders2	Found it	7/21/2018	While figuring out where to travel with Bkitty, this EC came into my sight. Hmmm.. looks interesting. So, onto the list it goes. We arrived at GZ, and was so happy that the tours were open to the public! We took full advantage and went down into the mines. Oh my, what an interesting place. And the history that is here is incredible! I would have never experienced something like this without this EC! Thanks you sooo much for showing me. Absolutely a FP!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EX8_old-newgate-mine

Masteroflava	Found it	4/7/2018	Snapped the photo, which doesn't do justice to the view! Looked around a bit but it's still closed up, so we headed back to the car. As we were leaving, the site manager came out and said hello. They are taking drone photos and getting things spruced up! She offered to let us inside so we could see the prison! The mine is not open yet, but the site will again be open to the public this summer after being closed for 9 years!! We feel like celebrities having gotten a sneak peak. Open house day in June and opening in July is the plan. Thanks, Morgan, for the mini-tour!! See you this summer!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EX8_old-newgate-mine

Capt. Bob	Found it	11/25/2017	Too bad the renovation is still in progress and all access has been shut down. I took a picture at the map monument and enjoyed reading about the mines. The prison history was interesting too. Before my visit I did a little hiking along the ridge line and the trail reminded me of Mt. Tom. Must be part to the same Akrose outcrop. Attaching a few pics of my visit. Enjoyed my visit. TNLN Thanks!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EX8_old-newgate-mine
Reader Ryn	Found it	10/8/2017	I vaguely remember visiting this place before with my family. It could've been 20 years ago now. I admit I had been putting off this cache, hoping the mine would open back up. I really wanted to check out the different rocks. Oh well. At least, I made sure to walk around and get a good look at the place. I'm not really all that fond of posting photos of me online, so you get my hand, and an assortment of exterior shots.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EX8_old-newgate-mine
Ms.Marbles	Found it	10/8/2017	It was a rainy day but I needed to do this cache today as it is International EarthCache Day 2017.

Spatial Distortion	Found it	10/23/2015	[center][size=3][i][b][green] Welcome to the Adventures of [/i][/b][/green][/size][/center] [center][size=3][i][b][green] Spatial Distortion [/i][/b][/green][/size][/center] In my quest to experience all that life has to offer I headed to Connecticut 2 a few days. I traversed the state from corner to corner. This enabled me to enjoy the beautiful colors of each region. What an outstanding time I had each and every step/mile of the way. The sights and sounds were simply beautiful. The weather was spectacular. Day 1 was 75 degrees and sunny. Day 2 was a true Fall experience. Full of sunshine but a bit cooler at 55 degrees. Had the sun roof open listening to a plethora of music from [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpxsMyoXUZQ]Asia[/Url] to [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vppbdf-qtGU]ZZ Top[/Url]. Picked up a bunch of Puzzles, Virtual's, The Oldest cache in Connecticut and the [i]only[/i] Web Cam cache in the state. Enjoyed fine cuisine from each corner of the state. Met several super nice people and had an all around [u]fantastic[/u] trip. Wish I had my new iPhone 6 with me but it didn't arrive until I returned home. Listened to [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWqLtXXzldk]I'll Be by Edwin McCain[/Url] while the bright yellow and red leaves fell thru my sun roof and caressed the sides of my car. While watching the beautiful sunset over a Connecticut field I listened to [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops]James Blunt - You're Beautiful[/Url]. That song turned into [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBumgq5yVrA]Let Her Go[/Url] by Passenger and the sun slowly disappeared.

Rad Booley	Found it	8/16/2015	Earth science never ceases to fascinate me... it's amazing to think that the beautiful, tree-covered rolling hills to the west of the Old Newgate Prison and copper mine were once a hellish sea of molten rock and flowing lava which went through so many changes over millions and millions of years... mind-blowing! Not to mention the terrific geological forces that altered the shape and structure of the mine and formed the surrounding hills-- forces that are still at work today and which are no doubt responsible in part for the needed repairs of the mine and prison buildings. I last visited the mine in 2008... hope it re-opens soon! Am sending the required pictures and answer to the question in Activity #2. Once again, thank you so much for another excellent EarthCache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EX8_old-newgate-mine

Smilch	Found it	1/6/2020	Made the great hike, for January 6 (2020) I cannot gripe at all about the weather! Mild, relatively dry for the most part, and sunny. A great day for a walk in the woods. I arrived at GZ cave entrance with little problem. Thinking "I hope there are no hibernating bears are inside!" I made find #1779 which was GC2D73E “Silas Doty's Cave” about 11:20 AM on a beautiful Monday. A great day to be outside Geocaching. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

Moonlitzoo	Found it	9/28/2019	Thank you for creating this earth cache,, and bringing us here. It was very cool visiting a cave, gaining knowledge. We trecked it to the near by fizzy cache. I had been looking at these two caches for months, maybe 8 or more, wanting to come visit the cave. Visiting from Kalamazoo. Today we hit :::tri state marker, got a state souvenir, visited a cave, 4:traditional state park caches in GT93, 4:traditional 4:virtual 1:earthcache 1:letterbox ;; 14 in all. Busy day..... People can be so undeserving--- meaning the decapitated tent, all the mess looked as if they left right before storm. Very cool cave, deserves better patrons. gets a fp	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

kzooOtters	Found it	9/2/2019	I had decided on a SE cache run last night. I made a short list of high values target caches for the day. My faithful companion and I left Kalamazoo, and had a great day. We found all our target caches, and attended an event. We had perfect weather too. Not too hot or humid, and mostly sun to make you smile. I even made time to stop and visit a life long friend for a bit. Not a bad way to enjoy Labor Day. Pretty neat spot I would have never visited or learned about. There is an abandoned tent & camp site 25 yards from GZ. Way more than I could hike out with. Might be worthy of a CITO this fall.

Tiger-5	Found it	3/15/2019	Geocaching with my Uncle Starkacher.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
Starkacher	Found it	3/15/2019	#6000 - 1:03 PM - I am from Toledo. I planned a caching trip with my Nephew Billy (aka Tiger-5) to get my 6000 milestone at the Silas Doty Cave Letterbox and pick up other nearby caches and also get some caches around Montpelier Oh. However, the conditions were too hazardous to attempt the Letterbox for the milestone, so I settled for the Earthcache at the namesake cave. It was drizzling with occasional snow all day with a cold wind blowing. I managed to find 20 caches and DNFed 3. The trek down the steep ravine to the cave almost results in several falls as the ground was soft mud with a thin leaf cover and more moisture was coming done. The entrance to the cave was filled with water preventing any close examination. Since I was not able to get to the Letterbox, I will need to return here again after a long dry spell. I will take some time on that trip to explore the cave. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

Merlin1392	Found it	7/29/2018	Wow! I think I made this doubley hard today. My GPSr put me at the "No Trespassing" gate, so I double checked the cache page and saw where I should park. Heading down Skoes road, I thought I found the right parking, but the NCT wasn't as well marked as I was accustomed to. Oh well, there looked to be a trail through the grass, so I took it. The night had been plenty wet with dew, and after about 50' my shoes, socks and pants were soaked! And, I still had plenty to go! Heavy bushwhacking, I finally found a grass mowed area, hmmm. I took that for a bit, and then headed through country again, only to resurface at a trail. Wahoo! A blue mark typical of the NCT. This took me up and around, but eventually came upon the cave where I captured pictures and information. However, I had to return the same way I came in as I had no idea where the NCT would put me on Skoes Road. Thanks for the grand adventure! The answers you seek have been sent.

salz69	Found it	7/28/2018	BASH WEEKEND BABY!!! I headed to my 10th MWGB this weekend and hit LOTS of great caches with Diggin Up Bones!! We teamed up with several variations OHPA, PFM, and GSMM. Got into town Friday, grabbed some, and then did a full day marathon on Saturday- lot's of good times with lots of good people!! On Sunday I was able to team up with my parntner !FIA! in Columbus- we went down and did the Butterfly geo art- a well done series!!! We stamped all the logs with our stampes, and/or signed OHPA (DUB and I couldn't get them to add INTN ) I replaced some soggy logs and a few busted containers, -not to mention a few places where there were 2 containers, but for the most part, most everything was safe and sound and ready to be found! All challenges that cannot be verified by my profile, virtuals and Earthcaches will be addressed as soon as possible Thanks for all your hard work!

PROBOB	Found it	7/25/2018	Unfortunately for me, our annual guys weekend ended up being the same time as MWGB this year. What to do, what to do?!? BOTH! So, I drove 1.5 hours to get down to bash... hit all of the caches on the fairgrounds except the night cache and the mob cache... then cached my way up to Mackinaw City. What would normally be a 4.5 hours drive took me 16.5 hours! LOL. I had a goal of 61 finds today to complete my quest for the hidden creatures Turtle souvenir... I ended up with 81. Woohoo!! I didn't have this earthcache or the nearby letterbox on my original target list for this trip, but when I saw how close I was going to be while doing the HBUSA series in the area - I couldn't resist hitting these. They've been on my to-do list for quite some time. I parked and made the long trek over to here, collected the necessary info that I already sent, took a pic that I'll upload soon, then headed further into the woods. Enjoyed the unique spot, marked as a favorite. Thanks for the educational smiley to add to my adventure!!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

BinderyGuy	Found it	7/14/2018	(#19193) I hooked up with CritterLover today for an Earthcache excursion to Pokagon State Park in Indiana. We're both trying to qualify for an Earthcache Challenge cache, and with 7 Earthcaches in the area, Pokagon State Park seemed like a good place to knock out a bunch of Earthcaches all at once. Once we completed all the Earthcaches inside the boundaries of Pokagon State Park...... by noon...... we exited the park and grabbed another Earthcache that was on our "to do" list not far from the park, and then grabbed some lunch at a local restaurant in the area. While eating our lunch, we discussed other possible Earthcaches we might want to grab, since we were well ahead of our originally predicted timeframe. This Earthcache has been on my "to do" list for a while now, and CritterLover was game for swinging by here on our way back to the Portage, Michigan area. We enjoyed a nice hike out to GZ for this Earthcache.... I'd been out here previously for the nearby "SILAS DOTY CAVE" Letterbox Hybrid cache (GCTZVW), but this Earthcache wasn't published at that time. At any rate, once we arrived at this Earthcache, we spent quite a bit of time exploring the inside of the cave...... VERY COOL!!!!!!! ....... this one is getting a Favorite point from me. We spent some time snapping photos and gathering the required information. Once we were satisfied that we had what we needed to log this Earthcache, we moved on to the next Earthcache on our newly-created list. Thanks to Lwnam91 for developing this Earthcache and giving us the opportunity to visit this location and learn a few things about this cave and this area of Michigan. Photos have been uploaded and an email with my answers to your questions has been sent. Living and Geocaching with the Spirit of anttoady Forever in my heart.

We went into the cave and made our investigation. Very cool spot. I never would have known it was here, so thanks for this listing. It looks like some messy people know about this place.

PamperedParakeet	Found it	2/24/2018	Mrs. Parakeet was gone for the day, so Mr. Parakeet took off north for some solo caching. He had targeted a few caches in southern Michigan in order to complete a challenge and also made a few other stops along the way. I stopped by this one after finding the nearby letterbox. It was enjoyable to read about this! As I was alone, I wasn’t going to go into the cave, but maybe we’ll be back sometime to go in together. Answers have been sent.

Highcountryhikers	Found it	6/17/2017	1:25 pm. Thanks for bringing us back!! Found the Letterbox the last time we were here in 2014, also checked out Silas Doty's Cave and crawled around inside. Exploring it a second time was just as exciting as it was the first. Didn't realize it was an Earthcache at the time, we could have logged it back then ?! Fate played a role in our visit today when Tjslady messaged us that she needed a D/T 4.5/5 for her double fizzy, we suggested she try the Silas Doty Letterbox...Silas Doty wins hands-down we told her!! Plus, it would give us an opportunity to drive back out and log the Earthcache. It was fun exploring the cave again, even though we didn't actually squeeze inside this time...just kinda' peeked in since we're not especially fond of tight, dark closed-in places !? Actually, if truth be told...we didn't feel like getting dirty ...BEEN there, DONE that the last time we were out!! The answers to your questions are on the way. TFTEC...and for bringing us back out to one of our favorite places of all time. Favorite point from us. #3929	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
Swing Dancer	Found it	4/1/2017	Out on a cool early spring day cache run with OCCD as the tour guide with the hopes of knocking out several westward caches, grab a D/T filler for myself, explore a cave in Hillsdale and as an unfortunate side note, see how many DNFs we can manage to acquire. It was way too many. OCCD has already been to this one but said he'd come along for the nice hike back and to make sure I didn't get caught in a cave in. Once on site I did a little research to answer the questions which I will be sending shortly, climbed into the cave for a nap and then headed back out. Thanks for bringing me here, favorite awarded.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
Allenite's Mom	Found it	2/25/2017	This had been on my list for years. Finally a friend we introduced to caching had it tagged for her 100th cache so after a week of beautiful and warm temperatures near 60's, we waited for it to go back to snow and freezing and made our way. Crazy! My son allenite, drove us and watched as we (Grayseelou and myself) armed with our gps made our way. The woods were alive with our shrieks as shoes threatened to come off in the mud and despite coming with hiking poles there were slips to be done. We found ourselves to the site of the legendary Silas Doty Cave! There was no chill of forewarned ghost to be felt in fact it felt warmer than it had earlier. Was this a good sign??? I was a bit apprehensive of going in, that opening looked a bit small but encouraged by Grayseelou and assured me she had her phone should our driver, allenite decide to leave us and after borrowing his coat just in case he did. Hey I didn't want to get mine dirty either, sissy girl that I am. I made it, and to be honest it wasn't as bad as I feared. Grayseelou quickly joined me and I was delighted I could stand up in there, see being short isn't all bad. We did some curious checking out and looked about for the answers we were seeking for this cache. All and all it was pretty cool. And allenite did join us for a bit, maybe he had gotten cold without his coat I suppose. Okay now all we had to do was get back out of here and all would be good and since I am logging this as a find you have no fears that another ghost has joined Silas in his hauntings.! Thanks seriously for the cache, I never would have come here other wise and it is pretty awesome! I have sent the answers.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
Grayseelou	Found it	2/25/2017	I have been looking forward to going out to this cache - saved it for my 100th find - it was a bit of a muddy find and that made it all the more fun. Entered the cave with Allenite's Mom (who could stand in the cave) and Allenite. Definitely worth the wait and worth the mud. Very beautiful area thanks for keeping this one going.

CITOcacher	Found it	11/11/2016	The trip was well worth the final approach. There was a second minor cave just east of the main one that had a lovely set of mini water trickles that sparkled in the sunshine. We had a perfectly mild and sunny day for our travels. The main trail was very well maintained. I have to admit to being mildly claustrophobic so caves aren't my favorite geological formation but this system was intriguing. Thanks For The Earth Cache & For Bringing Us Here.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
Scook	Found it	11/11/2016	After seeing the Facebook posts from friend's visits yesterday, I decided it was well past the time I've been wanting to do this Earthcache and the Letterbox cache across the stream. So we made the trip out from Detroit just for these 2 caches. Nice easy hike in from the North Country Trail except for the last 500 feet down the hillside. Watch out for shoe sucking muddy spots there. Circled the cave overhang from the wriog direction, did much better on the way up and our. Discovered the answers to the questions and explored the cave. Tight squeeze for a big gut like me. Took several photos but forgot to hold up a GPS unit for any of them. Email set to Geocache owner. Thanks For The Adventure and the Geology Lesson! And, of course, it gets a well deserved Favorite point.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
Nurse Nanna	Found it	11/10/2016	Please accept my sincere apology for a very very overdue log. I don't know if there are many other caches I've done that frightened me as much as Silas Doty's cave. I worried myself sick about all the horror stories of injuries, rough terrain, difficult hike, etc, etc, etc. I've had so many health issues and as a result a handful of surgeries and injuries that the thought of having something happen once again was just too scary. But.... when I chatted with Hello Lola and she wanted to come out here, I decided it was time to sweep my concerns under the table and give this a try. Mdeanbbn joined in and a team was formed. And what a time we had! I was so excited once I realized that by taking it slow it was more than possible...and that I had worried needlessly all these years. We parked at the designated area and began the ascent. At one point we had to make a decision whether to go up and over, or around and down. We chose around and down for the approach and it was the right decision. The beauty of this area in the fall colors was absolutely stunning. We were in awe of how isolated this is behind the hills on both sides. The challenge came with the meandering creek and the somewhat steep slopes on both sides and a wet terrain. The trail we followed was at a bit of a slant, so it was easy to slip on the slope and hard to stay straight on the trail, but we took it slow and were successful. Only a couple small creek crossings and we were in sight of our final destination! Once we'd arrived, it was so fun! We chose to enter the cave and though I was nervous, it was far too much to resist. I had to wiggle a bit to enter, but once inside it was like winning the lottery! We posed for some pics and oohed and ahhed over our success and the uniqueness of this place! Thank you so much for the lesson about this place. I had no idea we had caves here in Michigan, but now it makes sense. And I had no idea until now that this is actually part of the NCT. I guess that I did not realize that it passes here. It's on my bucket list to hike some of it, so this makes it much more feasible. Thank you for the chance to get more out of this adventure. Nurse Nanna, better late than never....and who hopes never to give up!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
mdeanbbn	Found it	11/10/2016	Got invited to tag along with HelloLola and NurseNanna to find this cave. We had a glorious fall day - wonderful weather for a hike. We looked at maps and satellite photos and decided to try to take the long way (but less steep) into the area, then attempt to climb back out. Decked out in our blaze orange, we set off. It was a nice hike to the cave. we were all able to climb into the cave, as HelloLola's pictures show. Great opportunity for a break.

rebel10	Found it	7/24/2016	While in the area for the Geobash we were told that the two caches in this area were "must do" before we left so despite the impending rain, desafio and I set out early this morning to come here. Parked near the trailhead and made the hike in. The rain held off for the most part and as we were early we did not see anyone else until we returned to our vehicles. Hiked in, didn't crawl into the cave but did take some pics and gathered the required information. Interesting spot. T4TEC and for bringing us here.

Skyecat	Found it	7/23/2016	This earthcache was on my to do list once I knew I was visiting MWGB and after visiting the tri-state marker, this was my next visit. Had the trail to myself on the way in and it was so hot, you could feel the steam in the air. Once down in the ravine it was a bit cooler so I checked out the cave, took some pictures then headed back up the hill. Stopped part way to collect my breath and in the silence heard some twigs snap. Soon I spotted the first deer, followed by 3 more. They were up along the top of the ridge and took their time walking across the trail. Thanks to the CO for setting up this unique earthcache. This gets a favorite point for the location, and the experience.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

Harley822	Found it	4/24/2016	It seems I start just about every entry with "We were going to go to" and today is no different. We were going to go for the caches on Apple Island in the kayaks but the Misses wanted an easy day umm yay...So I started looking and came across this cave and the neat history of it. So off we went to see Silas. We actually found a small parking spot off the road next to the trail head but we followed the co-ordinates to the parking area. Here is where we made our mistake, instead of walking back to the trail head we followed a trail heading straight for the cave, then it disappeared... There are cool tire No Trespassing signs along the way for the property next to the state land. We literally bushwhacked all the way there and back with the bushes whacking backing and hard. We also picked up several hitchhikers, when we got back to the car I had a bug on my leg and joked about it being a tick. When I looked down at my pant leg however I actually saw one crawling up my leg. So the score was me 7, the misses 4 and the team captain 3. After our tick infestation was cleaned up, we headed out for Hidden Lakes Garden. We found it to be a beautiful area and only discovered a small part of it in the 3 plus hours we were there. We love the "Dude where is my car" and how the clue was integrated into the story. So we gave it a Favorite, well played. We looked around for "Are we there yet" but like many others before us we could not find it. Hope the owner checks on it soon so we can avenge our DNF when we come back to explore some of this little gem of a park. All in all we went 7 for 8 today, not alot but what the day lacked in quantity, it more than made up for in quality. We loved both places and spending a day with the team on an absolutely beautiful day is heaven.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

Thanks for the great cache Someone from the group sent the answers	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
psychovw	Found it	7/25/2015	I'm in the area for Midwest Geobash 2015. I recently gained interest in Caves, and when there is a cave EC I make sure to do it. The preferred parking was filled up with 1 truck, so I found alternative parking. The trailhead was easy to find and I am glad I brought my camelback. The terrain was far more steep once I got closer to the cave. Someone had a mountain dew party at the lower part of the valley(?) and left all the packaging scatted around the fire pit. Maybe Silas Doty stole them from someone and left them near his old hangout. I didn't enter the cave because there was some stinky standing water right in front of it and I did not bring a flashlight. plus, that hole seems rather small. The mosquitoes were attacking me so it was time to leave. TFTEC [url=http://gonil.org]Geocachers of Northeastern Illinois[/url]	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
TheGrundalows	Found it	7/25/2015	Out on a high terrain and variety of types adventure with alona and Gates. Home base for the weekend was Midwest Geobash, but its just not bash without a little mini road trip. This road trip was to Hillsdale, as alona and gates were looking to do a variety of cache types, and we were interested in making dents with some new high terrain caches in the area. Found plenty of variety and had a lot of fun, before it got too hot and miserable! Where else to beat the heat, but in a cave? Gates sent in the info for our group.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
alona-spiegel	Found it	7/25/2015	With Team-Gates and TheGrundalows during Midwest Geobash. We decided to take the day to do some high-terrain caches. This was an Earthcache we really wanted to do because it seemed so interesting. We couldn't see anything as we were walking to GZ but then we realized we were on top of it. What a neat spot with a great backstory!! Mr. Grundalow and I were going to climb in but could only get so far. The bugs were pretty bad. It looks like there's a campsite nearby too but whoever was there last was very inconsiderate - there was trash EVERYWHERE. We didn't have anything to clean it up but it is in one pile.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

tanjuli	Found it	1/31/2015	I wanted to hike and this location was tempting: letterbox and earth cache at one go. I didn't find path (from the hiking path) to the cave so I ended up sliding down the hill. I studied the cave and and was planning to get in after I had logged the letterbox. However, I was not alone anymore at that point and I decided it was safer not to get myself trapped to the cave. Thanks for the fun!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave
itwasmymouse	Found it	12/29/2014	Caching my way to 1,000 finds. My main goal today was to experience and find the 3 geocaches at the Silas Doty Cave. Mission accomplished. I managed to find 9 out of 9 today including 7 traditionals, the Silas Doty Earthcache and the highly rated Silas Doty Letterbox. This Earthcache was absolutely amazing. I managed two squeeze into both sides and it was just an amazing experienced. I never knew this was so close to home. While back here I felt like I was in the mountains in Tennessee. I love photography so naturally I took close to a hundred pictures of the hike, the stream and the cave itself. This goes down as my all time favorite cache so far. It was a great experience and I recommend it to everyone. Email will be prepared and sent shortly.

3bunnies	Found it	10/25/2014	This and the like named letterbox were the reason for the trip to Michigan. The sky had become a brilliant blue as we started our hike and what was left of the fall color was beautiful. Last week would have been stunning back here with the hills and valleys. We kept a close eye on the trees looking for bow hunters and chatting more than usual to let anyone know we were coming. We had a nice hike with only a couple changes of direction looking for an easy way in. There is none by the way. Managed to find a new cave formation in a spring above Doty and sank to knee in it. Beautiful area. Thanks for the earth cache here. Good one.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

Kershaw Family	Found it	7/1/2014	The kids thought it was just their size, it is beautiful out there. Definately is too bad it was caved in.

superjosh92	Found it	6/30/2014	Day 26 and final day of my solo trip to Colorado! Started in Fort Wayne, IN and ended at home in Imlay City, MI. I knew I wouldn't be disappointed by Nicholas' Cave. I was dripping with anticipation as I strode forward towards the hole. Soon enough, my eager eyes were met by the gaping crevice that stood before me. I couldn't just stare, I had to get in. It was a bit of a tight fit, but that was perfect for me, I love the challenge. Took a little bit of loosening up the entrance, but before I knew it I was inside and I didn't leave until I was satisfied. 10/10 would do again.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

bluelamb03	Found it	6/6/2014	Found it with Model12 and Mr. Packrat during our Power Island road trip. We were passing by for the letterbox cache but still had some daylight as we returned so we explored a bit. Not too inviting a shelter, but an intersting formation never the less...

Team MEMILA	Found it	4/19/2014	Had a great time hiking the North Country Trail and doing a little caching. I tried to do this one in the winter, but there was WAY too much snow to even find the openings. Gathered the information and sent to the cache owner. As shown in a photo, there was still ice inside the cave. Thanks for the Earthcache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

Team MEMILA	Didn't find it	2/17/2014	Came here to find the Silas Doty letterbox and this Earthcache. Unfortunately there was simply too much snow to log either as a find. The cave entrance(s) were almost totally buried. So, I guess I'll be making a return trip when spring arrives and things dry out. Looking forward to it.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2D73E_silas-dotys-cave

Newyorkhikers	Found it	8/16/2019	Hiked this trail many times in the past. Never actually climbed up to explore this mine. Since the cache got me up here I decided to follow the mine shaft for a while. Very interesting area	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache
GeoStinkWeed	Found it	5/24/2019	This is very cool area with various mining holes and pits. Be sure to take care! I as usual went too far up the hill and had to backtrack to make the find. This seems to be a re-occurring theme I assume on account of my lack of patience. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache
bneiman	Found it	5/24/2019	I was strolling along the Dunning Trail, lost in inner contemplation, when I realized I had overshot the cache and had to turn back.

BashleyK	Found it	10/30/2018	Found the cache in good condition on this gorgeous autumn day. I feel so blessed to be out here today! I’ve been to this part of Harriman often, but not for a while so it’s great to be back! I love this style hide in this type of container, and I’m always up for a nice hike in the woods. Went exploring around the mines and ruins of the miner’s little village, then followed the stream up towards the upper mine cut and ate lunch. What a perfect afternoon! I signed the log and took nothing, but I left a skeleton warrior to guard the swag. (Happy Halloween!) Thanks for the cache!!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache

kcmcacher	Found it	11/4/2017	I followed the yellow trail from the Bald Rocks Shelter cache but somehow lost it and ended up bushwhacking to GZ, where I got lucky and found the cache quickly, mostly thanks to the awesome coordinates. Took some pictures on the way, will upload them. Thanks for highlighting this mine site with a really nice cache. It's always great to find an ammo can (was in great shape)!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache
GoodSamNurse	Found it	10/5/2017	Thank you to joek and maddog for this find. Everything is in great shape. I came in from the Lake Skannatati parking lot and took the Long Path to the yellow blazed trail. I looked at the hint before attempting to find this, so I sort of knew what to look for. I scanned the area around the given coordinates (which were great), and had my eyes on a particular spot, but for some reason I did not go to that immediately. I stayed below and searched a spot or two, then I climbed up, still ignoring my original thought (for some unknown reason), and went to some more wrong spots. I decided to make my way down towards the first spot I looked at, and of course I found it immediately....duh. I could have had this within 15 seconds of putting my backpack down, but I chose to prolong my agony and turned the find in to about a 7 minute search. The ammo can is in great shape and the logs are nice and dry. I took my time signing in as my dog re-hydrated. After completing my stay here, I made my way over to "Mine is yours". Thanks for the cache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache

We did notice that the "container" of this cache has developed a tiny pinhole in the bottom. Sooner or later it's going to need to be replaced or it might start to take on water.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache

kekachekev	Found it	11/29/2015	Came here with a few friends. Mistakenly approached from the top of the high ridge. What a descent.. tore a hole in my jeans and rolled my ankle slightly. Not bad enough that I wasn't able to hike the 2 miles back to the car though. Luckily the cache was hidden in a cool spot, and was an ammo can with some interesting swag. I have to come back sometime to check out the old mining town that I missed, along with another cache in the area that we didn't have time to visit.

BriGuyNY	Found it	10/26/2014	This was fun! After Surebridge Mine, I brought Lizrdh over towards the Lemon Squeezer, because we routed ourselves back over here to Hogencamp. As we approached there was the cutest green tree all by its lonesome that was saying, "Hello! Look at me! " and just up the hill from him, the cache awaited. A short scramble and a quick find, though I was real hesitant to touch it... the finder before us posted a picture... it looks like an animal has been using the container as a latrine . Inside, everything was perfect of course, as we signed the log and replaced the same before waiting out some hikers and going back down. Incredible how many of these things are scattered all around Harriman and the surrounding area. Thanks so much for bringing us here, and TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache
Lizrdh	Found it	10/26/2014	After leaving the [url=http://coord.info/GC23PFV]lemon squeeze[/url] cache, BriGuy and I hiked the Long Path/A-SB trail to Times Square! Such a cool place but without the hustle and bustle of NYC. From here, we continued on the Long Path to the yellow-blazed Dunning Trail. It was a small climb and we were grateful for the hint While we were up away from the trail we saw some hikers and trail runners below, but we tried staying still so as to go unnoticed. Until we weren't, haha. The real cheery smiley guy in the cache was begging to be let out. Great hide, and a cool place. Thank you for picking some great spots in Harriman to take us to today!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache

ZeeWire	Found it	10/26/2013	We found the cache, but we decided to climb up over the mine when we heard a group of muggles getting close and we did not want to risk exposing the cache. After having lunch at the summet, we signed the log on our way down and realized that was team Bacman & LabRat. Took a shell, left some coins.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache
LabRat101	Found it	10/26/2013	From Bald Rock shelter to here its 0.6 miles, but that is in a straight line. It was probably double that to get here. Today was a great day for a walk in the woods though, so it was a great trek. We even met a hiker walking bearfoot. On at ground zero, we had an odd encounter. There were a group of folks standing right there. They had to be geocachers right? As we approached though, they moved higher up the hill and didn't say anything to us. They didn't sign the log, so now we were not sure. If by any chance anyone logs a find for this today, it was still nice meeting you. Thanks for the cache, always cool to find the old ones.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache
Team Bacmac	Found it	10/26/2013	Fourth of six today found with LabRat and Arprodeo on a excellent hike in Harriman. There was a group of apparent geocachers hanging around GZ when we arrived. We could see that they had GPSrs in their hands and we heard at least one of them say "geocache" among words of a foreign language that we could not identify. After a few minutes they moved off and we made the quick find. However the other group hadn't signed the log. It would be surprising if they hadn't found the cache given where they had been standing. Thank you for the cache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache

After finding the Greenwood Mine cache we headed south along the woods road to where it intersected with the yellow trail and from there, we got to GZ quickly and found the cache quickly. There are no TBS in the cache and they should be ataken out of the cache's inventory. Just signed in. Thanks for the fun cache hunt.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache

2blindsquirrels	Found it	9/18/2010	(#136) First find of the day on an 8 mile circuit hike in Harriman today. Perfect day to be outdoors, we hiked from Lake Skannatati to the Lemon Squeezer via the LP, Dunning, R-D, Lichen and A-SB trails, and then back via the Bottle Cap, Surebridge Mine Road, A=SB, Dunning and LP. Checked out 3 mines along the way, with Hogencamp being the first. I've walked past this mine probably a dozen times but only today, with doing this cache, did we really see it. Fascinating site and so much more extensive than we ever thought. Experienced a little signal bounce but with a little help from the hint, we made the quick find. Signed the log and took the Dolphin Trackable, Left a fuzzy frog and a digital pedometer. We saw the log was getting pretty full so we left a spare logbook as well. (The 2 other trackables showing in this cache were MIA unfortunately). Thanks for the cache and bringing us to this very interesting and historic spot.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJ9EY_hogencamp-mine-cache

Team Smokey	Found it	12/30/2013	Oh my. I can't believe it's been over 5 years that this one has been on my radar. It's just that one time we were back here the mosquitoes were just absolutely horrible I wasn't in a hurry to get back. Finally, a brisk December day got me out here. It was a nice hike out here and I found the cache and the mine entrance pretty quickly. I was wary of entering because I just wasn't sure if there would be any bears in there hibernating for the year or not. I shown my flashlight in and didn't see any, but since I was solo today, I didn't dare venture into the mine lest something happen to me. I'll have to bring some friends next time, and maybe a canary just in case.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1CM6Z_hyde-park-gold-mine

SmileyPanda	Found it	12/29/2019	Cache Name – The Student Park Cave Earthcache Location – Collegedale, TN Condition of container/ host - cave is in good condition, and I remained as such after I left. Geomobile used – rode a bicycle Roughly how long has this cache been lonely - about three weeks If there was an animal nearby me, watching me as I was pulling this cache, and that animal could talk, what animal would it be and what would it say? A deer. It would talk everyone about the meaning of life Thank you to each and everyone one of the excellent CO who take the time to place these caches. If you didn’t lay them, I would have ran out of caches long ago and would have to do something responsible on the weekend instead of spending all my spare time pulling Geocaches!

Ambrosia	Found it	2/3/2019	As a Graduate Student in Outdoor Education, all41 is on a rotation where he helps out when the cave is open once a month. He also will help when they take students through the cave. I had been by this spot at other times, while walking around the campus. But I wanted to wait and log it until I was able to actually go inside the cave. I took a day that all41 was helping with the cave. It was pretty quiet, so he was able to take me on a personal tour. I was happy to be able to wander around for a bit. We didn't go in very far, because it was slippery for me, but I had a good time. It was drizzly out, and the poor student helpers were huddled around a fire, trying to keep warm.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1554H_the-student-park-cave-earthcache
Ditto and Pooh Bear	Found it	11/18/2018	(#3309) Second of four finds for the day. Our church did not have an evening service today, so we came to town to meet up with our geofriends – 3-happy-campers – for some hiking and caching. They had not arrived yet, so they texted to suggest that we find this cache while we waited. We had heard of this cave before, but since this is our first visit to this part of the campus (and only our second visit overall), we are seeing it for the first time today. Neat location! I am not the crawl-on-my-hands-and-knees-through-the-mud type, but if I could walk in and stay on my feet, I'd love to go in and see the cave. I recently saw the 3-happy-campers' video of their trip into the cave, so that will suffice. And I didn't even have to crawl on my hands and knees! E-mail has been sent.

caverdon	Found it	2/3/2018	My wife and I were in Cleveland visiting our daughter. After lunch my wife and daughter wanted some mother-daughter time for shopping and other activities, and so I decided to spend the afternoon catching up on caches. I noticed this EC on the campus, and since it's a cave, I gotta do it since I love caves. I parked at a nearby lot and hiked the trail to the cave. It was about 15 minutes before sunset and getting cold again, so the number of people around was very small. In fact, I only saw one other person as I walked the trail. I arrived at the cave entrance and studied it for the answers needed. I really wanted to go instead as it was the 1st Saturday of the month, but I guess I missed the earlier trip. After a few pictures, I was back on my way. Thanks for the EC! Sending answers after this log.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1554H_the-student-park-cave-earthcache

MythicLionMan	Found it	10/25/2016	We were making our way slowly along the trail from the last cache while taking pictures and exploring the many crevices and cracks. I found a fun chimney, descended to the bottom and spotted a great looking cave. I was about 4 - 6m below the surface and I thought what a great spot for a cache, too bad there isn't one here. I travelled back until the fissure I was in opened out, then climbed back up out of the ground through another spot. I was so enthralled with the spot I'd just found I decided to check my GPSr to see if it was within hiding distance of the next cache. I was shocked to realize that the next cache was only 12m away! For a minute I wondered if I'd actually been looking at the hide location, but it turns out that was a bit further away on the face of the cliff instead of inside where I'd been. I got closer to GZ, went down another chimney and popped out the face to begin searching. I wasn't exactly sure where to look even after reading the description and I finally read the hint to narrow things down. The hint helped a lot and I soon had the cache in hand. Then I climbed back up another chimney before discovering the 'easy' way down where the trail to the kiln goes down the ladders. I guess I didn't have Dakota with me the last time I was here because I don't remember carrying him down the ladder to the trail below (he's not a small dog). Thanks for hiding a cache in a really fun place to explore. I had a blast going up and down the rocks. TNLN	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3JEQA_daniels-limehouse-cave-cache

Zavod	Write note	2/28/2016	FlowerSnake, OccasionallyIFindThings, and I, were driving up to pickup Zavod Junior from Scout camp. We had some time to kill before pickup, so we stopped at Limehouse Conservation Area to explore, see the ruins, and pick up a few caches. We ended up cutting our hike short, so we'll have to return to get the rest of the caches. OIFT is normally a pretty solid person, but today her claustrophobia started acting up, so she quickly left the crevasses. I wanted to keep searching but everything was covered by a think layer of ice, and I had two people waiting for me. Given our time constraints I figured I'd have to return anyway, so I didn't end up looking for this one. But I LOVED the area, and would really like to give it a favourite point. I'll have to come back just to do that!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3JEQA_daniels-limehouse-cave-cache

mustangok1	Found it	1/4/2020	Out and about getting caches to begin filling my calendar again and try to keep a streak up. I love earth caches and this one was on the radar so I had to give it a visit. I love the information in this cache. I have become interested in the lesser-known (to me anyway) forms of mining and this one really piqued my interest. I never realized how phosphate was produced and had assumed it was made in a lab or came from manurer. Boy was I wrong! So this turned into a real delight for a lesson. Thank you for that! Thank you so much for this earth cache! Thank you for the smiles on our map and the smiles on our faces! Happy Caching!

caverdon	Found it	10/12/2019	It's the weekend for the 2019 EC souvenir, so I headed out before sunrise to get an EC or two. Also to get any additional caches that may be on my route. I had passed by this EC on previous trips but it was always dark at the time. This EC can't be done properly in the dark, so I waited until I had time during daylight hours. When I arrived in the early morning hours the sun had been up maybe a half-hour. It was a chilly fall morning (low 50s), beautiful woodlands and crystal-clear from a cold front that passed through last night. I was the only one on the Trace from what I could see. I walked the short trail and got all the needed answers. Very interesting history of the area. Will send answers shortly, thanks for the EC on the Trace!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3QDAW_natr-phosphate-mine

Ran into some rain in spots but nothing bad, and took a nice long ride down the Trace. Thanks to all the cache owners for placing and maintaining these caches for our enjoyment.

libbie5	Found it	4/1/2019	Vic has been wanting to go back to New Orleans, so we figured for our 42nd wedding anniversary would be a perfect time! Headed south on Sunday afternoon, taking our time down the Natchez Trace Parkways hiking and caching along the way! Stopping in Nashville first to give a few virtuals! Hard to believe it has been 42 years, lots of trials but mostly great times! Thinking back it is hard to believe all the things we have done, been lots of place and did lots of things! Rising 5 children was a challenge, but great, since we did everything with them. They where our life and energy!! Then to have 8 Grandsons which have kept us young!! Over all we have been really blessed and thankful for all the years!! When we started this 10 years ago this summer, we never dreamed that we would hit the 21 thousand mark, but we have had lots of fun, hiking and hitting the water, doing them!! Just wish we could still do those long hikes and paddle trails, but time moves on, we have been blessed to have such good friends in this game!! Too many to name, but hear is a shout to some that we have done lots of caching and trips with, Team Conway, Bunrun, Fit to be Tied, thanks for all the support and fun along the trials!! Our first stop was at Cheekwood in Nashville to pick up 3 virtuals!! First time here, beautiful place, to bad some of the trails where closed and the statues where crated up, so hope we have the right answers on one of them!! Finished Creekwood and now for a quick stop at the part next door! Finished the quick hike and now on to the Parkway! After spending the night at the Inn, we made the quick grab this morning, now back to the Parkway!! First time stopping at this stop!

If you can get it back up and running in the next week or so contact me to get it re-listed. Otherwise plan to move it slightly and set up a new cache page. [B][green]Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published.

Mongo	Temporarily Disable Listing	11/13/2012	[b][u][red]OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED[/b][/u][/red] Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last several logs on this cache it appears that this cache is in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the [red][b]”NEEDS MAINTENANCE”[/b][/red] attribute is showing you will need to do the following. http://tinyurl.com/y8n7vuy Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and will be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. Thanks for your understanding, Many thanks, Mongo Groundspeak Reviewer	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

kbh3rd	Write note	5/9/2010	I wasn't planning on going to Potosi today, so I didn't look up this cache before leaving. But when I found myself there I recalled your wonderful short history of Potosi & Moses Austin, which I greatly enjoyed. So I kept my eye out and spotted what I thought must be the tomb while driving along Highway 8 in the middle of town. So we circled around and found it. Not just the Austins' tomb but the whole cemetery & adjoining 178-y.o. church are a treat for history buffs. I didn't look for the cache, but thanks for sending me that way. I put a picture of the tomb in Moses Austin's article on Wikipedia.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

Gmalibby	Found it	8/16/2009	Like so many other loggers, I was out to conquer Washington County, my last of the day and my last of a four day journey. I arrived after dark but decided to try it anyway. Had my own little battle here as I managed to fall on my head. I do it pretty often but had managed the whole trip without falling once. I was squatting down on the cement trying to peer under a rose bush holding the flashlight and the GPS when I got top heavy and tumbled over on my forehead. My thought was..what a perfect place to konk out. Save time and money getting me to the cemetery. Actually I can't even find a bruise. But it makes it memorable for me. Then I discovered when I got back on the road that I had left my Garmin there. So back I went. I was surprised I had not roused the neighbors, but no porch lights came on, no dogs barked, no cop cars cruised by. Thanks for a great adventure and good cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

The sigh of relief when we located the container was enormous. We even took a moment to look around -- the history is so interesting. We also noticed that there seem to be an amazing number of churches in Potosi -- and beautiful structures at that. We'd be interested in knowing just how many there are!

zeroremorse	Found it	12/31/2008	Visited this site a couple of times before I started GC'ing. This is a micro cache consisting of a black film canister with a scroll for a log. The weather was beautiful for my visit, and I was able to find the cache very easily. Log was wet, so I was not able to sign it. It is very interesting to walk among some of the very old graves adjacent to Moses Austin's tomb. I was able to take several interesting photos while visiting this area. I would like to revisit in the future to sign the log once it dries out a bit. Fun, and educational experience. TNLN TFTC. P.S. I did straighten some of the flags around the tomb.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb
twilight rabbit	Found it	10/29/2008	Grabbed this nice cache after leaving Columbia early this morning on a trip to Florida. Taking the lesser traveled roads when we can, so this leg brought us to this great cache. Thanks for placing it. The log was SOAKED, I think because the container was on it's side, so I left a new sheet that should hold it for a while. I think it will be better if finders will leave the container upright.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCHDZ7_mine-au-breton-moses-austin-tomb

I knew I was coming to the area to look for the cache and a couple of days later I found a biography of Moses Austin signed by the author. How cool is that ? I have yet read it, but it is on my list.

HBmamaG	Found it	10/1/2008	Wish I would have read the last log and fixed this cache. Owner now lives far away, can the next person please take a baggie, some paper, and maybe even a new film cannister to fix this? It's too interesting of a history to let it go.

nan-d1955	Found it	11/27/2017	On another adventurous road trip with Spiritwolf922. This trip is all about getting MINGO, 2 webcams, challenge, virtual, and Earthcaches, and other caches of opportunity along the way. In total, we drove almost 2200 miles in 4 days! I've passed this Earthcache many times, but since this trip was about grabbing more of those cache types, this was the time to stop and check out the cave. It didn't disappoint! All necessary answers have been submitted for both of us by Spiritwolf. Thanks to all the COs for placing and maintaining their caches and THANKS to my awesome navigator who gets us where we want to go. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
spiritwolf922	Found it	11/27/2017	Out caching with Nan-D1955 on a road trip that began the day after Thanksgiving and ended when we got back home late the following Monday afternoon. In all, we drove (well, she drove; I navigated) nearly 2200 miles from Missouri to Wyoming, picking up counties, virtuals, traditionals, earthcaches, a pair of webcams and challenges along the way. Though we started in the late morning of Friday, we made great time, and for the other days, we were up before the sun and didn't make it to our hotel until well after dark. We saw some amazing sights, visited some historic places, and had a blast! Thanks to my geopal, Nan, without whom I couldn't have experienced all these caches. Thanks to all the COs who placed and maintain the physical caches, and the COs who researched and developed the virtual, webcam and earthcaches. Without you, we never would have stopped there and discovered what you already knew was there. All answers to virtual and earthcaches have been submitted to the COs, on behalf of myself and Nan-D1955.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave

I met up with friends and off we went to Missouri before I had to travel back to KY for the Christmas holiday. As always, I had a blast hanging out with my favorite peeps!

City Slicker	Found it	12/26/2014	Our intrepid team was passing through this area today. We were on our way home from Sedalia, Missouri, back to the Cincinnati, Ohio area. We loaded caches near our route, although I was the only one that brought my GPS. Luckily, I had loaded them on my in-car GPS as well and could see them coming up. I spotted this one on the radar and headed for it. We like earthcaches and will go out of our way for them. We made the trek to GZ and garnered the information we needed. I was the only one with a GPS, so my picture will have to suffice. As it was rainy, we spent minimal time at GZ and the others were back in the cachemobile as I was taking the pic. I sent the needed info to the CO to validate our visit. Thanks for the nice leg stretch and the earthcache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave

TerriBikes+	Found it	8/16/2014	Sooooo glad that Stacey (TFC) and I decided on our cache day trip even with the rains today. We drove from St Louis to finally get our "IconChallenge" cache and to try to complete our August souvenir challenge. Obviously we needed an EarthCache to accomplish that and this EC proved to be an awesome choice! As an ole geologist and spelunkers, this cache was right down my alley. I love all kinds of caves. The history related to this one makes it even more interesting. I'll email answers from a computer soon as I'm logging this on IPhone (rainy condition had the elevation readings varying so we took an average at ground level at GZ). Thanks for bringing us to this amazing and majestic natural wonder !! You get my favorite of the day!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave

We are on day 5 of our Cross-North America Journey. So far we have covered Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in Canada. Then we did Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Several of these states were first-time visits for us. We enjoyed beautiful sunshine for most of the trip but encountered 3 MAJOR thunderstorms. Wow! I've not experienced anything like that before.

North Coast Cacher	Found it	6/3/2014	Found/completed earthcache. Been wanting to accomplish this earthcache for a very long time now but, whenever I would be in the area, it would be dark. Finally arrived today in early morning just for this earthcache and to do some hiking. Mosquitoes convince me that hiking is out of the question. Made it to the cave, gathered required information, and run to vehicle because of the mosquitoes (must have been feeding time). Great area, will have to return another day just for the trails. E-mailed owner answers to questions.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
The Fat Cats	Found it	5/25/2014	Wow, what a great cave and area surrounding it! We really enjoyed the walk, even though we did keep picking up little hitchhikers...tiny caterpillars, we think, that were hanging off the trees and bushes. When we finished our hike and checked each other, I had over a dozen on me! We carefully got them off and placed them on nearby bushes. As for the cave, we loved it! We don't have the same geology in Southern California, so we don't have caves quite like these there. It's really amazing how many caves there are in this part of the US. I sent our answers (about 4 months late due to misplacing my notes) and I'll post a pic or two soon. Thanks so much for bringing us here!

fearlessknits	Found it	3/22/2014	Well, if I got the Mailbox, there's no way I'd miss the Earth Cache! One of my favorite icons to earn. The walk to it was beautiful. There were a couple families enjoying the picnic area and reading the informational signs.Tony Banks and I did the proper research then set to the more fun task of taking pictures and climbing to the top! He stated that it looked like a leprechaun got sick up there, the mosses were so bright green all over the place. I might have tried to put it more eloquently, but now leprechaun puke is the mental image that sticks in my head. Thanks for the EC. I will send the answers by email soon!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
Tony Banks	Found it	3/22/2014	OCW fearlessknits. We walked to this one all the way from the mailbox. It nearly killed me. I turned around and walked backwards for a while as to use the other less sore muscles in my legs, when she told me to turn around and look. Very cool. We walked in as far as the fence would allow us, and noticed all of the names written high above on the cave ceiling. It was one thing to have our pictures taken in front of the cave, but I wanted to be on top of it! I'm afraid of heights, and once when my back was turned to the precipice I had a momentary feeling of panic, even though I was nowhere near the edge. Thanks for bringing us to this spot!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave
Rock Chalk	Found it	12/20/2013	We hadn't planned on going after this one. Rather, we were just going to get one of the traditional caches in the park as we made our way east from KC to St Louis. But this one was so close that we couldn't resist. And it was so cool to see the cave! No one else at the park today, so we had the place to ourselves, which was also cool. Spent some time exploring the area, took our pic, and off we went. Email has been sent with answers to CO. Thanks for a great Earthcache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC28VWC_graham-cave

City Slicker	Found it	11/19/2011	I joined up with Visiting Vet Tech and Thurston House for a day touring the Louisville area, on both sides of the river. Our goal was to get as many of the virtual caches in the area as we could, all the while collecting other caches that were between us and our goal. We made a challenge to each other before setting out, so it was a race to each cache to identify the information we needed, or to locate the cache. We are unable to send the information to the CO, but we are including pictures in our logs. Thanks!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1CEHK_cave-hill-spring

I ended up with getting 4 earth caches, 1 virtual cache and my very first webcam cache that day along with a number of traditional caches.

calethix	Found it	7/30/2006	That cave was awesome. I'd say I'm mildly claustrophobic and I made it through ok. I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to get out the exit but seeing daylight shine through gave me the incentive I needed. I forgot my good flashlight at home but luckily had a small one I threw in my goodie bag of things to leave at caches. I couldn't believe how cool (literally) it was in the cave. I think it was over 90 and very humid today. I sure missed the cool air of the cave when I got back outside. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave
wrchili	Found it	7/30/2006	I went geocaching today with calethix. He decided to walk through the cave and I walked the trail. We found this cache without much difficulty. The hard part was actually getting to it, because it was a little slick, but I let him do that. We left a firefox t-shirt and took an alien. TFTC! It's in a beautiful park. We heard some people talking about other caves in the area, so we'll be back soon to explore those as well.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave

Red Poison Ivy	Found it	6/21/2006	Found it, but the slope was very slippery and almost down right dangerous. The cashe was a mess, but we were able to find a few items to trade.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave
Car54	Didn't find it	6/17/2006	Add us to the list of folks who couldn't find this cache. We looked all over the place and used the hint to help narrow down the location. Mrs. Car54 played mountain goat while Mr. Car54 looked in lower areas. There are so many good hiding places in the area that it's possible the cache is still there, but we couldn't find it.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave
famO4	Didn't find it	5/21/2006	We didn't find this one today. I tried while Mr. Famo4 and the two little ones waited on the path by the cave. I think they were ready to press on, so I wasn't able to search very long. Hope to come back and find it later, though.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave
CelticFC	Didn't find it	5/13/2006	OMG! What the heck was I thinkin'? I am sooooo glad that Strohem was there pushing me...no literally, pushing me through that cave! Definitely give it a try! Very disappointing not being able to find the cache :(	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave
Strohem	Didn't find it	5/13/2006	We were really excited about this cache and decided to brave the cave. It had been raining for a few days and we knew we were going to get wet and MAN did we get wet. It was a really cool experience to go through the cave. The only disappointment was that we didn't find the cache. We looked EVERYWHERE! We hope it is still there and if not, that it gets replaced. We'll go back and try again another day. Thanks Strohem	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave

Team Shydog	Found it	11/26/2005	I was getting my cache trip together and noticed the last few logs said the cache was in need of attention. Since this is one of the older caches around I decided to help. I put together a new cache container with swag and replaced the old one. Great location. Found the spot and was very happy the new container fit perfectly. The container is a snap and lock so I hope this keeps the water out. I am glad I could help keep this cache alive for others to enjoy. I live to far away to adopt, I am sure someone local could do a better job. Thanks for showing us this spot. Chris-Team Shydog Monticello, IN 47960 Grr.. I be logging this as part of the coin quest, no scurvy dogs in this cave. GRRR......	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave
CarlC	Write note	11/26/2005	I also would hate to see this cache that I placed so long ago in such an interesting location go to waste. However, It's impossible for me to maintain this from here in Brazil (the country, not the Indy city) where I live now. That said, if anybody could help this classic Wolf Cave cache, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't know if it is even possible, but I would also give up ownership rights to any responsible cacher who could take this one over. Please post your thoughts here. Thanks, CarlC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave

Whitaker5	Found it	10/8/2005	Part of our crew decided to go through the cave to get to this one. The cave was nice and dry...but it is either getting smaller, or I'm getting bigger. Had a little difficulty finding this as it has moved from it's original location...nice location...great photo opportunity.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave
IndyDogCachers	Found it	10/1/2005	TNLNSL The Dogs had a great time and were well behaved along the Wolf Trail. We took the trail in "reverse" for the first time (we've hiked it several times before) making it easier traversing the rocky path to the front side of the cave with the dogs. The creek the trail crosses and outside the cave exit was welcome refershment for the dogs, they had a great time playing! contry to popular belief, Beagles do love the water.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B04_wolf-cave

Old Bet	Found it	8/5/2018	If I maintained a list of all the great “discoveries” I made through geocaching, I am pretty certain Widow Jane would be close to the top of the list.

I signed the log as per geocaching custom and replaced everything as found. Whew! Now perhaps I could finally set sights on returning home to Columbia.

Flamingo4ever	Found it	9/21/2015	It took me a couple of minutes. My GPS kept on putting in about 20 feet away. I finally looked where I thought it should be and it was. I'm not really good at ammo boxes. I got it shut but I don't think I got it locked. I almost never got it open. I dropped off a travel bug so hopefully it will head on down the highway.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1WMDM_experimental-mine-cache

*gln	Post Reviewer Note	7/3/2014	[b][red]VERY LITTLE TIME LEFT[/red][/b] Greetings, I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs. I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived on my next check of disabled caches which could be shortly. If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. From the guidelines... (visit link) "... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time, normally a few weeks , in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing." Thanks for your understanding. When you have made all repairs, please remember to post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute! Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published. Glenn "Seek quality, not quantity". Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is Glenn (*gln), Mongo & Banjo-Boy [b]If you plan on repairing this cache, please log a note to the cache (not email) within the next few days so I don't archive the listing for non-communication.[/b][/red] [size=1][beige]#f59d747f7e2efaeb6e13b7b75dd75d3a[/beige][/size]	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1WMDM_experimental-mine-cache

When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. I'm temporarily disabling it, to give you an opportunity to check on the cache Hope things get fixed up soon.

fearlessknits	Found it	10/13/2013	I've been wanting to find this one for some time. When I realized there was no way I'd get to Columbia before dark, I decided to just give in to fate, drive in the dark and get a couple of Rolla caches before the sun failed me. Like eravau, GZ found me in a grassy spot. I put away the Garmin and just started looking in a Likely Spot. That paid off quickly! I had the cache in hand and just had to be a bit stealthy as traffic nearby picked up. After signing the log and returning the cache to its proper place (cool thing, whatever it may be), I sat in my cache-car eating a sandwich and debating going after Just One More. You can guess the outcome of that mental conversation!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1WMDM_experimental-mine-cache

eravau	Found it	9/7/2013	(#1,924) I attended the nearby event today and as I was heading out from there to some place I needed to be elsewhere in town... I saw I was going to pass within just a few feet of this cache. How could I possibly resist stopping? I looked down at my GPS and followed the arrow to where it took me... the middle of the grassy shoulder along the road. There obviously wasn't anywhere to hide a regular-sized cache here in the middle of nothing. I gave up following the GPS and just went with my geosense. In short order... the cache was in hand... a little over 40 feet from where the GPS said it should be. I took nothing... but left my signature and one of my signature items. Thanks for this cache in a cool location, Chungaz!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1WMDM_experimental-mine-cache

tanatko	Found it	11/4/2018	after letting our eyes feast on the beauty and silence of fall lake welch, it was time to get back on trail and search for another green box to turn to smiley... up we went to this one... the phones were pretty much useless when close to the mine, so we left our backpacks at chosen "picnic" log and went down to search... there was a nice little pond in the mine, and we truly hoped the cache was not there fortunately, it wasn't as we came back up, and started on our lunch, 4 different law enforcement officers showed up: 3 from @wesi's side and 1 from mine... obviously, they made a calculated risk-based decision on who is the bigger threat to their operation hmmm, good to know for the future in any case, they came, look around, asked us if we were hikers and one of them suggested that we were not within 20ft of trail... well, we could have said that we had been following a deer trail (we did follow some kind of trail but I guess that it is not a good idea to challenge an officer in full armor supported by 3 colleagues from other agencies the cache container was sitting right where we sat, fortunately without getting noticed the officers left and we were quite puzzled about what they were searching for, but didn't come up with any credible explanation, so went on with other topics... only until about 30mins later, when the big 4 showed up again, this time from a different side (cache was already nicely back in place)... at that time we decided to pack our stuff and leave who would have thought that such a small abandoned mine will bring such a story along with it the container likely needs replacement.. the content was completely swamped and molded... thanks for the smiley	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMDG7_barnes-mine-cache
wesi	Found it	11/4/2018	This was ... interesting. Approaching GZ together with @tanatko, we tried to guess which end of which ditch we had to be on, and managed to get it wrong twice. The hint didn't help, because what it seems to suggest is pretty much a big deep puddle right now... but then we spotted something over yonder that indeed turned out to be the cache. Yay! Contents were totally ruined though, soggy messy soaked thru-and-thru. There were two log books, but both of them were moldy bricks of goo where the pages could no longer be separated. We cleaned out the cache the best we could, carried out the trash, and left a fresh log in an intact little ziploc. Lets see how long it holds up. Then, we proceeded uphill of the site, to sit down on a log, and munch some lunch. And while we were there, chatting and eating, @tanatko says "There is a cop over there approaching from behind you" pretty much at the same moment where I said "There is someone coming up from behind you, looks like a cop". Yes, they approached us from two sides. Once they got close, we asked what was up ... but they didn't tell. One was a park ranger, one was local police, one was a state trooper, and there was another dude off in the woodworks. Very odd. You just don't normally encounter cops from four agencies walking the off-trail woods together. You encounter them even less far away from squad cars and donuts. But here they were! The State Trooper was nicely polite enough to say "Sorry that we spooked you", but the park ranger dude kinda ruined that good intention by saying that we were not supposed to be there, since we were more than 20ft away from a marked trail. I apologized and said that we just came here to check out the mine (true!), and would go back to the trail (true!). But I guess if that 20ft rule is really the rule, I have been "not supposed to be there" on pretty much every Harriman hike that I ever did in my life >:O. But we acquiesced, and - after finishing our lunch - left. Which was quite pretty much at the time when LEOs (who had left us alone) started circling back to the mine. Something was up. I have no idea what. I hope they got whatever perp or nuke or gangsta or squirrel or drug stash or "buy-2-get-4-free" donut shop that they were chasing.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMDG7_barnes-mine-cache

GoodSamNurse	Found it	10/4/2017	Thank you to Joek and maddog. I found it this time, but it is so sad that somebody left it out for an easier find. The crevice was protecting it from the rain, and now the old logs are saturated and barely legible. I found legal parking right next to St. John's Church of the Wilderness in the hiker's parking lot. I was able to cut across through a narrow clearing from the parking lot and into the woods here. I found the area again quickly, and as I approached the mine, I looked up and to the side to where I thought it would be, and it looked like a tambourine was just sitting there on the rocks. As I got closer, I realized it was the Tupperware geocache; just left completely out in the open. I opened it up to a disgusting mess, mold spores all over, but my fingers wanted to touch everything anyway for some reason. I didn't deny myself the usual fun I have with the contents and my camera. Although it wasn't as enjoyable an experience, it's always nice to find a log that is over a decade old. The little blue Warriors were in the container and I just happened to have a Wounded Warrior pin on me, so I left that in the cache. Pictures to follow.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMDG7_barnes-mine-cache

Glad I had looked at past logs and the terrain rating, as the hint would probably led one to believe they might actually need to swim.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMDG7_barnes-mine-cache

GoodSamNurse	Needs Maintenance	6/27/2016	Hello, I looked in several areas around this heavily flooded mine. I was even witness to the "water monster" that was previously mentioned. Wondering what the heck it could have been; maybe a turtle. It was afloat, and I heard it go into the water, bubbling away. I did not have my above knee rubber boots with me, and I doubt I would have entered, regardless. Although disappointed, how can one be angry when finding an interesting place, and getting much needed exercise. I tried to take the needs maintenance action out, after reading more logs and realizing that it was never in the flooded area. I looked in other places, but didn't come across it, so for now it is just a DNF...sorry.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMDG7_barnes-mine-cache

BriGuyNY	Found it	11/8/2014	Very cool mine. Hiked here from the Pole Cat Farm Cache that's referenced in the description. Thought I would follow the mine access road as seen on the trail maps, but couldn't find a single trace of it, so I just bushwhacked from the Long Path instead. Upon arrival, I noticed a great deal of water in the flooded mine, so I stood back hoping I wouldn't have to wade. Looking around, I spotted something unusual at a more appropriate location, and that was it! A bit challenging to navigate around a fallen tree (from some time earlier this year) though in no way did it compromise anything with regards to the hide. I love how this container is original and still in great shape! As I left, I did notice the mine access road, so I took it towards an open field, where I quickly lost it once again. If it was still visible, I could have taken it as a shortcut back to the church where I had parked, but it wasn't, so I ended up making a long loop around. Unfortunately for me, this bushwhack is what planted just an unbelievable amount of ticks on my boots and pants. It's late in the season, and I hadn't seen a single one since June, yet for the rest of the day I was picking them off, as I noticed them crawling without showing mercy. All in all, this was a lot of fun. Everyone loves old mines (and blue pens), so thanks for bringing me here, and TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCMDG7_barnes-mine-cache

Woods road? Deer path at best. It was an unusual hike but eventually found the mine. Cache is in a perfect spot. My map showed we took the woods road back to the Long Path, but we never felt like we were doing anything but bushwhacking the whole way.

Memfis Mafia	Found it	12/27/2014	[center][b]Mafia Tour 2014[/b][/center] [b]Thanks for the Earthcache.[/b] NotBrisitsh and Memfis set out on a three day road trip to start our Xmas vacation. We started in Colorado and drove through New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee and Mississippi. We drove many, many miles and NotBritish logged many of them. She got her permit just two days before we left. She was excited and daddy was nervous but she did a good job. We tried our best to stop at strategic spots and grab the caches that stood out. Most were older, non-traditional, Wherigos(of course), or in cool places. I’m sure when all is said and done we will have forgotten to log a few but this trip was not about numbers it was about experiences. Thanks to all the cachers for providing the opportunities for us to share. I won’t soon forget the fun we had on this trip nor the new friends we made. We were lucky enough to meet many new cachers on this trip during a few well timed events. It was enough to make us want to do a return trip to many of the places. We are adding a log that sums up some of our experiences and have added favorite points along the way as well. I believe we have sent in the required emails for all the Virtuals and Earthcaches but in case we didn’t we saved our photos. We found that we took too many pictures to log on each individual cache so we are going to upload them to our family blog. I was surprised to find this beautiful place so close to the highway. There is no way I would have known to stop and take a walk here without geocaching. Thanks for all of the work that goes into publishing an Earthcache.

Came back to this one and searched the only to spots (again) that made sense. I love hiking this time of year. The down side is the leaves make excellent camouflage. The cache hide area was hidden by the fall defoliation. Happy to make the find and explore the tunnel. Not a whole lot to see now. I wonder how far it goes back. SL.

goalie95	Found it	10/28/2019	This was so cool. I had looked for another mine cache over in Pyramid Mountain, but it was nowhere near as intact as this. If it weren't for the fence I would have been that guy to go in a little. After getting some cool pictures we made quick work of the cache and was the 1st container of this type that I had seen though, apparently, this is a common scene with this cacher.

scubakirbaquacacher	Found it	10/22/2018	Wow, what a cool spot! I think it would be soo cool to go exploring inside of the old mine. Probably dangerous though I guess. 🤦🏻‍♂️ I’ve never seen a cache container like this before. We were trying to figure out what it was originally used for. At first we thought it was an old mining tool or something. Whatever it was, it definitely was waterproof and we were impressed that the original logbook was still in there, dry as a bone since 2007!! TFTC and the fun!😁👍🏼🐠	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC11AZ2_high-ledge-mine
Dale n Barb	Found it	10/21/2018	Out caching today with scubakirbaquacacher and this was our final cache of the day. We arrived at gz and checked out the mine entrance. Would love to explore the inside of this mine but I bet it would be pretty creepy. We spotted the cache but was not 100% sure it was the cache until we saw the writing on the side. After signing the log and replacing we went up the hill a bit more and saw the other entrance to the cave...YIKES. That is one heck of a drop. Good to see they have it fenced off even though someone has already cut the fencing to get a closer look. One slip and you are gonner if you decide to go through the hole. We stayed back.

HappilyEverAfter0818	Found it	3/18/2018	We needed one for the calendar but weren’t up for a P&G. This one was great, took us out into the woods a bit, but more importantly, took us to a place we didn’t know was here (the mine) and we learned the history. Thank you!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC11AZ2_high-ledge-mine
KanoeBillder	Found it	1/27/2018	Continuing along the trails, I followed my GPS cursor until this very obvious cave entrance appeared. This is a very neat location. It is nice to see a mine where the opening hasn't been filled in. I would have liked to have had a look inside but it was well fenced in and I didn't want to violate anything to get in there. After taking a few snaps I began the very short search which was helped by the very good hint. The interesting custom crafted treequest container was very sturdy and the cache and log are in good shape. Thanks for bringing me to this interesting and historic mine entrance.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC11AZ2_high-ledge-mine

Blister173	Found it	1/12/2017	Found with Lego Maniacs while trying to knock off Morris Canal Park caches. To be honest, the cache container looked a little suspicious when I first saw it because only part of it was visible. I have not seen a CC with a handle that looks like that, I almost didn't want to touch it. But of course I knew that it had to be the cache and continued on. The contents were nice and dry, the container is doing a good job that way. Interesting location! TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC11AZ2_high-ledge-mine

StrattonRob	Found it	9/23/2015	#2434 - This was one of my first DNF's early on.....in fact, I came here three times and was clueless, looking all over the place. I needed a calendar day and instead of traveling a long distance to get a few (there are some easier P&G's near me that I am saving for when I really need them), I thought I'd revisit this one again....put on my hiking shoes and headed down that oh-too-familiar trail. I've learned a lot since the last time I looked, but I started getting deja vu......but carefully examining the hint, I checked out a couple of place, and hit paydirt!!!! Nicely camo'd container (which is probably why I couldn't find it before). First of three at this park this afternoon. SL, TFTC.

Joekirr	Found it	5/23/2015	This was really cool. I love spots like this. At first I scratched my head thinking the cache was closer to the mine and the fence was preventing me from getting to it but knowing the CO wouldn't do something like that I expanded my search a bit and lucked out when I literally stepped on it. I didn't think it belonged where I found it so I put it a little more where the hint said it should be and gave it a little more natural cover. Great location for a cache. It's in really good shape, a little weathered but otherwise well hidden. Thanks for bringing me here.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC11AZ2_high-ledge-mine

scooter1130	Found it	4/4/2015	Great area for a cache. I had never been on these trails before, even though I drive right past the park entrance a few times a week. For some reason< missed the cache the first time I looked right at it, so after a little more searching and rechecking some places, I came up with the find. Left a travel bug whose mission to complete a race ended in 2013, so I guess now the Gonil Travel Racer is just on a sight seeing tour, and the mine here looked like a good place to explore.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC11AZ2_high-ledge-mine

brewsterjuice	Found it	9/3/2019	Today I tried to fulfill some challenge caches that I had signed in Napanee a couple of weeks back. They required that I do caches of different types with different cache series in the GC code e.g. GCX, GC1, GC2, GC3 etc. So today I ran around (and drove a lot) around the capital area doing different cache types. The toughest part was finding enough caches of the right age and type that I had not signed before. I hadn't ever walked around Pink Lake before today. Hey! Its not pink. But it is lovely and an easy hike. I'll be back! Thanks for the EC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2EFHM_mica-mine-at-gatineau-park

It's funny that I ended up visiting Gros Morne Nat'l Park before Gatineau Park, and I live here... ...well, I moved here 2.5 years ago. I tend to geocache more when I travel. But this time, my friends Red Ketchup and his girlfriend MJ were the traveling ones, spending the weekend here at our place. They wanted to go hike and see the leaves turning colours, so I decided to take them here. It was my first time too (but not my last). There was a lot of people, but the temperature was perfect.

cd.cuts	Found it	9/9/2017	We were sad to miss out on a different Earthcache at Pink Lake because we saved it for so long for a perfect occasion that it got archived before we had a chance to come look for it. So, we were happy that this one was still patiently waiting for us today - a gorgeous sunny Fall day which gave us the opportunity to show this meromictic lake to our parents omega57. The views from all angles were gorgeous today. We stopped a lot to take beautiful pictures. Eventually, we arrived at the Mica mine. I must admit that I was expecting a trail littered with large, bright shiny chips of Mica like we experienced at GC1355, but in the end, it looked like a regular mine pit on a regular trail. We read the plaque, took the measurements, then continued the beautiful hike around the lake. E-mail sent to CO. Thank you for placing this Earthcache.

wesi	Found it	8/18/2016	I knew what Mica was, of course, Geology101 had taken care of that, and more. But I had never seen a mica mine. Alas, GZ in this case was quite steep and fenced off, and only with full zoom of my camera or with help of my binoculars could I actually look at what mining-worthy mica looks like. One day later, I visited GC3760Z, which really offers a chance to get up close and personal with mica, and is another Earthcache that I highly recommend. This one didn't disappoint either, after all, the two Earthcache icons are what made me hike around Pink Lake in the first place. I would not have gone on this hike without the Earthcaches.

Water was coming out of both little caves so couldn’t sit there. That time of year I guess. My friend had rubber boots on it was to deep. Sent pic of myself to Red Witch. Will add one of the caves.

OhioRider	Found it	9/7/2018	After a long drive I arrived in Sussex Thursday night and was able to put my name on a list for the morning flight. I was lucky and at 6:30am we were off to the sky. It was amazing.. Since I finished earlier than what I expected, I was able to spend the day exploring and geocaching. I ended up in St. Martins. Wow, such natural beauty.SL TFTC Heading back to Sussex I noticed this one and debated but the path was clear so off I went!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave

gnome#4	Found it	5/16/2018	Day 20 I am out here on a two month Eastern Canada trip. I started off from Toronto and slowly made my way to the Maritimes. I caught the boat to Newfoundland. Cabot Trail and then PEI. My Dad flew into Montreal in mid June. My son into Hamilton a week later. From there, us three generations did a roadtrip back to BC, visiting family all along the way. I planned my entire trip by mapping out a route following earthcaches, virtuals and webcams. In two months, I visited about 400 of them. Currently, I have found nine of the ten provinces oldest or active caches. I only need to find Saskatchewan. I also have seven capital cities in the Great White North Geotour and hope to have all ten by the end of the summer. This has been an awesome trip and thanks to all the CO's who have created and maintained all the caches I have found and visited. After staying five days at a coworker's of mine whom we work together in other areas of the country, I loaded up the car and carried on with my trip. My next destination is going to be Moncton and Amherst. tftv	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave
7TNT	Found it	10/6/2017	Been wanting to get this one-off our “To Do List” and today we decided to take a break for work around the house and go for it. Easily our way in the path, carefully descended down the bank and found the caverns. This one gets a FAVORITE and THANKS for adopting this cache so others will find it.

cogsweba	Found it	8/21/2017	Taking a drive down to the Fundy Parkway today with Mom, to see some of the new sights and to watch the solar eclipse. Our new glasses came in handy at Long Beach, where we ended up viewing the event in the end. Very fun day overall! Never would have known this was here if not for the virtual. Recent roadside cutting made it fairly easy to reach the path into the caves, and the descent was no biggy, but edging over the water towards the cave was a bit difficult. Finally managed to get there, but wasn`t able to explore due to the lack of a flashlight. TFTC!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave
Kirok	Found it	8/7/2017	Lotusfire and I are in the east enjoying a short vacation from Ottawa, Ontario. After going to the Maritime Mega on Saturday, we enjoyed a visit with my sister, and then are now heading west via Saint John. This was one of our primary targets for the day. After a quick push through the initial roadside brush, the trail quickly revealed itself. A bit of a steep decent to the water, but then we spotted the cool caves. Thanks for bringing us to this beautiful little spot.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave

outsiders2	Found it	8/2/2017	BQ and I stopped on our way through to the Mega event to get this virtual. We kinda found the correct parking suggestion. While doing so, the owner of the adjacent property asked if we needed some help. We said that we were looking for the caves nearby. "Oh! Park here, and I will take you to it!" he said. WOW, Awesome! He guided us to the cave, with a little bushwhacking. We exchanged stories about ourselves while climbing down to the caves. He was in great shape for an elderly fellow. BQ got the picture of us as the Caverns. It was really nice to chat with a local and get the guided tour of the cave.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave
The Blue Quasar	Found it	8/2/2017	As we pulled up to parking we met up with the homeowner across the street who was quite happy to lead us right to the caverns. That made things a lot easier for us and we got some personal history as well. We didn't go right inside because our guide had intimated that we were ill equipped to do so :( so we took a few pictures instead.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave
Pokertime!	Found it	7/18/2017	Très heureux d'avoir trouvé cette belle Virtual! En camping à Cap-Pelé, j'ai laissé ma petite famille la bas ce matin pour aller signer la Webcam à Saint-John et quelques autres qui boucheront un trou dans mon tableau Jasmer. Je ne pouvais donc pas passer à côté de celle-ci sans aller voir ces caves! Je n'ai pas de GPS puisque je fonctionne avec l'application sur mon téléphone cellulaire, c'est donc avec ce dernier que j'ai pris la photo. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de Virtual au Québec, voyager nous donne l'opportunité d'en visiter d'autres et pour cela, c'est fantastique! Merci pour cette cache qui se vaut un FP!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave
CocaColaCacher	Found it	7/14/2017	In from Ottawa for a geocaching vacation. I was staying at a cottage in Prospect Bay and caching in the area. I made a few stops after heading off PEI on my way home. I couldn't really find a path from the road so I just bushwacked over to the maintained trail. I didn't venture too far down as I was caching solo today and I didn't have any cell signal. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave
londonwesty	Found it	7/4/2017	This was one of our target caches of our area trip from Ontario. Parked at the designated pole and bushwacked in up from the little driveway opposite. Found the mown path then the path to the cave. Made the descent and explored the cave opening. Very cool! Found the mown path exits to the west side of the wooded lot which is about 100m from the designated parking spot. Thanks for this Virtual. Fave point.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave
lyriclass	Found it	7/3/2017	A great adventure finding this cache. There is some challenging terrain: steep trails, a rock climb, and wading, so be careful. It is definitely worth the trek.

Dead Chuffed	Found it	9/8/2015	I found this cache on the fourth day of my six day New Brunswick road trip. Travelling from Ontario, through southern Quebec to New Brunswick, I managed to put over 4000km on my trusty car while earning a new souvenir (New Brunswick), qualifying for various challenge caches, finding one rare webcam cache, a lot of wonderful earth and virtual caches and just generally enjoying being by the seaside! I'm really surprised, given the rarity and therefore popularity of virtual caches, that I am the first person in fifteen months to find this virtual! I had no problem finding the mentioned telephone pole, but had a bit of trouble finding the trailhead, so I ended up bushwhacking the short distance till I reached the trail, which I was able to follow the rest of the way. For some reason, I had imagined that the trail would bring me out opposite the caves, so I was surprised when I actually found myself on top of them and had to get down to their level. I ended up hanging onto a tree trunk and very ungracefully dropping myself down the rock face to ground level - I had misjudged how far down it was by almost 2 foot, which had me worrying if I was going to be able to get back up there or not! But I'm stubborn and determined, so after taking the required pictures, I managed to scramble/haul myself back up the rock face to the trail. Phew, that wasn't too hard after all (just don't tell my parents I did that on my own ). TFTV!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC8CAE_the-amazing-caverns-of-kitts-cave

caverdon	Found it	10/12/2019	It's the weekend for the 2019 EC souvenir, so I headed out before sunrise to get an EC or two. Also to get any additional caches that may be on my route. I had passed by this EC on previous trips but it was always dark at the time. This EC can't be done properly in the dark, so I waited until I had time during daylight hours. When I arrived in the early morning hours the sun had been up maybe a half-hour. It was a chilly fall morning (low 50s), beautiful woodlands and crystal-clear from a cold front that passed through last night. The parking lot was empty and I never saw anyone while I was there. I read the signs at the shelter and made my observations from the pit overlook. The vegetation and angle makes it challenging to get the full perspective. I noticed part of the fence had fallen to the left of the overlook, and there is a visible trail where people are walking up to get a different view. I don't think that's advisable judging from the deterioration around the sides of the pit. Many thanks for the EC! Sending my answers soon after this log.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC42XKK_natr-napier-mine

Edited 8-12 - I am now home in the Chicago suburbs, so I am adding notes/comments/all that good stuff to my logs from my trip. Driving back from Lawrenceburg by way of Alabama along the Natchez Trace Parkway. I was just bopping along, and saw an EC RIGHT THERE, so I made a hard turn and stopped. Message sent with the answers. It was all I could do not to go down the hill and see what was down there, but there was so much green, I was pretty sure I would slide to the bottom and not be found for at least a few months. True story - the town next to mine here in Illinois is Naperville. So that is kind of like Napier. But not the same. So there you go, and thanks for another EC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC42XKK_natr-napier-mine

Headed south on Sunday afternoon, taking our time down the Natchez Trace Parkways hiking and caching along the way! Stopping in Nashville first to give a few virtuals! Hard to believe it has been 42 years, lots of trials but mostly great times! Thinking back it is hard to believe all the things we have done, been lots of place and did lots of things! Rising 5 children was a challenge, but great, since we did everything with them. They where our life and energy!! Then to have 8 Grandsons which have kept us young!! Over all we have been really blessed and thankful for all the years!! When we started this 10 years ago this summer, we never dreamed that we would hit the 21 thousand mark, but we have had lots of fun, hiking and hitting the water, doing them!! Just wish we could still do those long hikes and paddle trails, but time moves on, we have been blessed to have such good friends in this game!! Too many to name, but hear is a shout to some that we have done lots of caching and trips with, Team Conway, Bunrun, Fit to be Tied, thanks for all the support and fun along the trials!! Our first stop was at Cheekwood in Nashville to pick up 3 virtuals!! First time here, beautiful place, to bad some of the trails where closed and the statues where crated up, so hope we have the right answers on one of them!! Finished Creekwood and now for a quick stop at the part next door! Finished the quick hike and now on to the Parkway! After spending the night at the Inn, we made the quick grab this morning, now back to the Parkway!! First time stopping at this stop! TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC42XKK_natr-napier-mine

BriGuyNY	Found it	12/27/2017	Fun stop here along the Natchez-Trace with Lizrdh. We had it all to ourselves, due to the off-season and how it was pretty cold outside this time of year. We made some observations here, which Liz sent along for us both via email to the CO. Nice lookout from the platform too. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC42XKK_natr-napier-mine
Lizrdh	Found it	12/27/2017	This was a fun stop off the Natchez Trace with BriGuy. Although the temps are frigid cold, it was a pretty sight to look out over the railing at the mine down below. It's always so impressive to think of workers back then using so much hard, manual labor to dig and carry out the iron ore. We read all the signs, and tried our best to collect the info we needed before heading towards Nashville. On a side note, we passed the death and burial site for Meriweather Lewis nearby on the Natchez Trace Pkwy! We're always fascinated with stories related to Janie & Clark, and the journeys they all went on together. Thank you for bringing us to another cool spot!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC42XKK_natr-napier-mine

A_No1	Found it	4/6/2019	Today I went to the park to do a trail study on the Green River Bluffs trail for my Outdoor Recreation Class -- That means I hiked the trail and took pictures of various people doing what they do outside. The warm temperatures and budding flowers (red buds especially) made it a very enjoyable hike. Doing the hike gave me an opportunity to do this earth cache. I really enjoyed this walk, not too much elevation change and some pretty incredible scenery. Trees will be leafed out soon as they have fat buds and are ready for spring. Squirrels and people were out in full force and lots of little tiny wildflowers - saw some trillium. I also like the big sycamore trees as the trail got closer to the bottom of the valley down by the green river.

KevinM12345	Found it	8/8/2015	This was a nice morning hike our camping group took before our afternoon cave tour, although it did start to get pretty warm towards the end of the hike. I didn't have my GPS with me but I knew there was a cache on the trail and found the sign. The warning in the cache description about insect encounters being likely was spot on as I was stung by a yellow jacket further down the trail. Thanks for the cache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1X4DP_maca-green-river-at-mammoth-cave
iPajero	Found it	7/21/2015	It certainly was hot and humid today walking through the forest to ground zero and back collecting the information required to complete this earth cache. A lovely view of Green River from the listed coordinates. Thanks for the development of this earth cache for us to do and enjoy. Our Travel Companion TB31M47 and Cache Mobile TB59EG4 came along for the ride. [b]Greetings from South Africa![/b] A bit on our background: At the outset of our holiday we had found 11656 caches (all done in southern Africa) and this is this first time we are caching on another continent. The logo on our 'all terrain' caching mobile reads "I would rather be lost in the woods than found in the city" and our travel companion TB has traveled over 195 000 kilometers achieving this milestone as we have explored the wide open and untamed expanses of southern Africa. It is, therefore, with some trepidation that we set out caching in the vast expanse of USA with its enormous cities and massive network of freeways in a first world country. Having overcome encounters with dangerous wild animals (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, hyenas and hippopotamus) in game parks, this does give us a degree of confidence that we will be up to any challenge the USA may have for us. A quote that we hold dear reads "Every morning you are handed 24 golden hours. They are one of the few things in this world that you get free of charge. If you had all the money in the world, you couldn't buy an extra hour. What will you do with this priceless treasure?". While in the USA we will endeavor to use the hours we have to discover as much of the country as possible and find some caches along the way.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1X4DP_maca-green-river-at-mammoth-cave

JMVonFange	Found it	7/5/2019	The Von Fanges were in Louisville, Kentucky for the 101st Optimist International Convention that was held just blocks away from where the Tyler Hotel, site of the first annual convention of Optimist Clubs was held in 1919, once stood when JM convinced me that we should take a different route home and stop at some of the Mark Twain sites in Hannibal, Missouri and then take a driving tour of my high school stomping grounds in Chillicothe—I agreed since there we so many Mark Twain related and other older geocaches. While we should have gotten an early start today and visited all of the caches in Hannibal on our list before the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum opened this morning, we didn’t and then decided to make a slight detour back into Illinois to add smileys in two more new counties, since GC3ANDJ: Memories of the Green Parrot. helps us to move one step closer to completing GC43JXH: Angry [*$!@`?\ Birds Challenge – OCCT and we couldn’t just skip finding a cache in Pike County. We enjoy stopping at older virtual caches and Earthcaches, like this one, since they often provide us with the opportunity to learn something new and take us to places we ordinarily wouldn’t visit while traveling. With the holiday weekend and National Tom Huck Days festivities, in addition to the Hannibal Bicentennial activities, it was very busy at the cave today and although it has been several years since we have done a cave tour we could not justify waiting until nearly the last tour of the day with more than 300 miles to drive yet today so we gathered the information needed to answer the questions and took a picture to post with our log even though I typically avoid having my picture taken or posting it online; however, since I am using my phone as my GPSr today it is absent from the photo. The answers have been submitted via the geocaching messenger and I am backdating the log to the day that we actually visited this location rather than the day the answers were submitted.

CRVonFange	Found it	7/5/2019	#1892 – The Von Fanges were in Louisville, Kentucky for the 101st Optimist International Convention that was held just blocks away from where the Tyler Hotel, site of the first annual convention of Optimist Clubs was held in 1919, once stood when JM convinced me that we should take a different route home and stop at some of the Mark Twain sites in Hannibal, Missouri and then take a driving tour of my high school stomping grounds in Chillicothe—I agreed since there we so many Mark Twain related and other older geocaches. While we should have gotten an early start today and visited all of the caches in Hannibal on our list before the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum opened this morning, we didn’t and then decided to make a slight detour back into Illinois to add smileys in two more new counties, since GC3ANDJ: Memories of the Green Parrot. helps us to move one step closer to completing GC43JXH: Angry [*$!@`?\ Birds Challenge – OCCT and we couldn’t just skip finding a cache in Pike County.

Sequoia	Found it	4/7/2019	Found with Kimpossible on our journey to MOGA and beyond. We heard about this place thru local literature and thought it would be a fun stop and it was. We met the gals working here, but instead of free loading information, I traded them tree care advice after inquiring about the large Quercus macrocarpa out front. I asked if it was a state champion tree. They said no but our Sycamore is a state champion. That was cool finding that tree. Mahalo for the cachew!.

We were able to get our photo taken outside the entrance, then came back into the shop to visit and ask the questions to help us complete the cache. Really wished we could take the tour. Mrs. iowaPete has always had a strong interest in caving, going back to her college days. I guess we'll just have to come back again. That's okay with me. Soooo much to see in Hannibal.

lostinthegarden	Found it	8/25/2017	Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals. At this point we were in the home stretch, having re-entered Missouri and heading back to St. Louis. After an overnight stay in Macon, we spent most of the morning in and around Hannibal. We expected it to be busy with lots of tourists, but it was remarkably quiet today. Although we didn't take a tour, we enjoyed our visit to the cave area and learning more about the geology of the area - thanks for the earthcache! Answers sent to the CO.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

memomls	Found it	7/31/2017	Love these places. Favorite point from this cacher!! Another (probably my last, darn health issues) crazy, jammed packed caching trip with InxtricablFate, magtfplanner, and Skeletor10. The goal this time--connect all the counties! After this trip IXF and mag will have all their counties connected. Me? I still have some work to do. But this trip puts me over 33% of the US counties. As usual we're targeting counties, Delorme pages, virtuals, earth caches, and the ever shrinking webcams. The trip may be tough, the stats are great at the end. I apologize for the cut and paste log but I do appreciate the co's placement and maintaining if these caches.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

InxtricablFate	Found it	7/15/2017	County: Marion Delorme Page: MO-025 Found with magtfplanner, skeletor10, and memomls Thanks to all the cache owners who placed these caches for us to find. Logging these now many months late. Sorry to the COs for not giving a great log where deserved.. Time to catch up on well over 1000 caches backlogged for various reasons. If there is an ALR, the answers were sent long ago by my teammates (will resend if deemed necessary). Pics posted where required. Adventure Log: Over our travels of the past few years, magtfplanner and I have laid waste to nearly half of the US Counties . A challenge cache found last year required that we connect the Lower 48 with a solid county-to-county line. Upon examining our maps, we decided what one of our major goals for 2017 would be.; a week-long Midwest trip could connect 4 sections, thereby connecting everything. Another major draw for this trip was claiming 2 more Cache Across America caches [KY and MS], which would put my total to 47, and 3 more State's Oldest [KY, TN, and AR], putting that total to 31. As has become typical, and expected, on this sort of trip, we averaged over 50 caches and over 400 miles per day. memomls and Skeletor10, when they were able to keep up, would send in our Virtual and Earthcache answers almost as soon as we had them, leaving us less to worry about when we got home with 100s of caches to log. magtfplanner and I kept things moving at a good pace and we accomplished all of our goals., despite a major time setback in Lexington. In our 6 days, we claimed 340 total caches!! (225 Traditional, 55 Virtual, 26 Mystery, 26 Earthcache, 4 Multi, 2 Letterbox, 1 Wherigo, 1 Webcam, and 46 Benchmarks) Summer 2017: This year magtfplanner and I orchestrated a most ambitious and exhausting summer with little rest time between trips. This made some of the last-minute trip modifications a bit more difficult but we managed to slog our way through all of our goals. Of course, this left no time for logging so they are all being logged weeks after the fact, hopefully before the finale trip. June 10: New RM challenges, Dollar Puzzle-Art, and Video Game series around Vero Beach, FL. June 11: A very short "local" caching run June 15-20: West Virginia County and Delorme Challenge completion June 24: Numbers Run in Ocala, FL - June 25: Some local caching in NW Jacksonville June 29-July 4: Louisiana Parish and Delorme Challenges July 8-9: Another Numbers weekend around Ocala.

skeletor10	Found it	7/15/2017	Found while on a week long caching trip across America with memomls, magtfplanner and InxtricablFate. The goal is counties, counties, and more counties! Our trip starts in Nashville, and we will meander our way through TN, KY, IN, IL, MO, AR, MS, and AL, collecting counties and Delorme pages along the way. We also targeted other caches of interest including virtuals, earthcaches, challenges, and others with high favorite points. The answers to the earthcaches and virtuals were submitted by memomls on behalf of the group. Unless otherwise noted, all caches were found in good shape, log was signed, and cache returned to its hiding spot. Please read magtfplanner's log for more details about our visit. Thank you for contributing to this awesome adventure!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
magtfplanner	Found it	7/15/2017	Cache Log: The dude running the entrance to the cave site was fine for us swinging over to the front door for a photo. His resemblance to the namesake of this cave was uncanny and, I suspect, a little more than intentional . Memomls was on top of sending all answers for the team. Pic included. TFTEC! Day 3 Log: We started at sunrise from our hotel in Mt Vernon, IL . We are still behind schedule from our day 1 miscalculation, but had every expectation of catching up to ourselves by the end of the day . We rode the I-64 into St. Louis where we took a little extra time to make sure we at least found the high priority targets we wanted there . Once done in the city we routed North / East through IL up to a fun ferry crossing in Kampsville and then onward into Hannibal for a tour of “Mark Twain Village” . We shot directly east in MO until we reached Macon and then directly south all the way to the state capitol building in Jefferson City . We finally made it just a couple hours shy of sunrise so we stopped directly in front of the towering spire and napped until the sun shone down on the start of our day 4. When the clock struck 12 AM we took a tally of our finds for the day at 61 total, including 48 Traditionals, 6 Virtuals, 6 Earthcaches, 1 Mystery, and 7 Benchmarks . Adventure Log: Found with inxtricablfate (IXF), skeletor10 (SK10), and memomls on a 6 day road trip through TN, KY, IN, IL, MO, AR, and MS . And what a road trip it was ! Our goal for the trip was to take 4 separate sections of counties on our map and run the finds between them from county to county until we had successfully connected all 48 contiguous states . Our route started off in Nashville, TN; meandered north toward Louisville, KY; cut west to St. Louis, MO; took a round-about way into Jefferson City, MO; shot south to Searcy, AR (just north of Little Rock); and finally back east into Nashville through Memphis, TN and Tishomingo, MS . In 5 days we covered more than 2200 miles, averaging about 440 miles per day with 50-70 finds each day . Despite staying around the Nashville area the last (half) day, we still tacked on an additional 200 miles, rounding us out at 2400 miles in just 6 days time ! Since this is the only road trip we took this year that was not focused on completing a specific state (i.e. WV and LA) we had some flexibility to play with our route to make it bring us right where we wanted to go . This enabled us to finally track down the Cache Across America (CAA) finals in KY and MS; visit the state capitol buildings in KY and MO; and locate the oldest in KY, TN, and AR. Not only that, but we were able to spend quite a bit of time on the freeways / highways, rather than the winding country backroads, so for the most part we made great time enroute from stop to stop . Thanks to the combined efforts and specialties of our caching crew for this trip, we executed a relatively flawless trip (minus the day 1 timing hiccup ) and maximized our time . I glued myself to the driver seat and got us to each find quickly and safely . IXF took the co-pilots chair to manage the navigation and overall trip timing, working through the frustration whenever I ignored his directions . SK10 kept his phone at the ready to provide supplemental satellite imagery whenever we needed a bird’s eye view of a GZ . Memomls took on the mantle as our scribe, keeping our social media accounts actively tagged and sending answers to COs whenever we completed an earthcache or virtual. Because of this awesome team dynamic we managed to secure a whopping 340 Total finds for the trip, including 225 Traditionals, 54 Virtuals, 27 Mysteries, 26 earthcaches, 4 Multis, 2 Letterboxes, 1 WherIGo, 1 Webcam, and 46 Benchmarks . A big thanks to each of the COs who hid the many caches we found on this extended weekend adventure . We couldn’t do what we do with you . Happy Caching !	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
nan-d1955	Found it	7/10/2017	Spiritwolf922 and I were headed up to Hannibal and Quincy to pick up some virtuals, Earthcaches, and a cache in Quincy because I needed one there to qualify for an alphabet challenge. We picked up other caches-of-opportunity along our route. Spiritwolf and I are working on a challenge cache that requires us to have 50 Earthcaches, so when we saw that there were 5 in Hannibal, we thought we'd hit the jackpot! We worked through all of them and Spiritwolf submitted the answers for us. My first teaching position was at Mark Twain School in Hannibal many years ago and have been to Mark Twain Cave multiple times. This retired school teacher thanks you for adding to her Science knowledge. That was never my strong subject. The teacher hopes we got an 'A' on our homework. Thanks to all the COs for maintaining their caches and adding to our fun today. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
spiritwolf922	Found it	7/9/2017	Today, we were on another mission: Nan-D1955 needed a cache in Quincy for a challenge cache, I needed to add to my virtual count and we both need more earthcaches. We headed north and soon found ourselves finding some opportunistic caches along the highway. We easily added 300 miles on the Nan-Dmobile during this one-day trip. After a fortifying lunch at 'the Maid-Rite place' (not the actual name of the establishment, but it's apparently what the locals call it), we walked around Hannibal to work on the surrounding virtual and earth caches. Back in the car now for this one, though. Standing at the cave mouth on such a hot summer's day... it was like standing in front of a blast freezer door. Cold air just poured from the opening and we soaked it in for a minute before shivering and heading back to get some more caches before we had to head home. All answers and/or required photos have been submitted to the COs via Geocaching.com's messages. Thanks for being a part of our caching adventure!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

MaxB on the River	Found it	5/11/2017	Caching with Saintvi and working our way back home after a 10 day road trip caching counties of KS, OK and TX. I was interested in the traditional cache here to drop a TB for Iowa, SaintVi found the earthcache. What a nice place, no room to join a tour, but next time through the area will remember and return. Saintvi emailed the answers and the staff was really nice and friendly. Thanks for the cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
saintvi	Found it	5/11/2017	On the way home to Michigan after a ten day county caching run with MaxB On the River through southern Kansas, northern Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle. Last night Max said we would stop at the Mark Twain Cave on our way home, so I pulled up the list of Hannibal caches, found one named Mark Twain Cave and thought, "Cool! An Earth Cache!" I didn't have my GPSr with me in the hotel room, so I jotted down the coordinates and the questions before packing away my laptop and going to bed. Today as we neared Hannibal, I said something about the Earth Cache and Max said, "What Earth Cache?" "The one at the cave." "There's an Earth Cache at the cave?" Turns out she was looking for a traditional cache to drop a TB in before we crossed the river. I had no idea there was a traditional here, as it was late and I was sleepy and didn't look at the map. So we were happy to have a "twofer" here. The staff was friendly and helpful. One was curious about geocaching and came out to help us look for the traditional cache and take our picture outside the cave entrance. The tours were fully booked with school children, so we browsed the gift shop, got our answers, found the cache outside, posed for pictures and hit the road. It was a nice stop and someday I hope to make it back to tour the cave. Answers are on the way. Thank you for bringing us here.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

Bulldog	Found it	7/9/2015	My Mom is 79 years old and is going blind from Macular degeneration and Glaucoma. She has cardiac problems so her stamina is not so great. She has always enjoyed traveling but cannot drive anymore so I take whenever and where ever I can. We are on a 5 week trip to our original tribal lands (we are Potawatomi). So I planned this trip to get her to see as much as we can cram in. Of course we had to check out all things Mark Twain while in Hannibal. We were lucky enough to go to the cave on a weekday and we were the only 2 people in the group and the guide was so sweet to let my Mom take her time. I have been in many caves but never one that was mostly limestone. It was a great tour.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

kaiwarrior	Found it	5/25/2014	I had a great time on a road trip with Joe Friday and SWAG Dragon. We left Thursday morning at 4:15 from Colorado and arrived at the hotel in St. Lewis MO 20 hours later. Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip. We only found 100 caches total including all the events. Every one of the caches was special for some reason. I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches. Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history. I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away. The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix. Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going. I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
FWIA	Found it	5/25/2014	What a weekend this has been! My first Geowoodstock and a memorable visit to the area where I used to live here. Met many new cachers from all over the country and, of course, got to hang out wit KUMI (Kansas, Utah, Missouri, Iowa) That's the team name for ,yself, bucknuts, louinliberty, hockabee & baa daata. It's always a guaranteed good flippin' time when this group gets together. This weekend was no different. We spent Sunday cleaning up a few more caches, WIGS, etc we had on our radar. Hannibal was a needed stop for me on the way home because I wanted to get some of the Virtuals & E/C's in the area. I came here many. many years ago as a child on family vacation. That's when we toured this cave and I still remember that tour. I was scared to death the cave was going to cave in on us. Had great memories coming back here. Thanks for that! Blue ribbon awarded.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
24hawki	Found it	5/25/2014	Heading home from Geowoodstock XII in St. Charles, MO with cneumann98. The plan of the day was to concentrate on some special caches in Hannibal and find at least one cache in each county we passed through on the way. On-board 21st century technology sure helps with this kind of plan!! We followed the instructions on the cache page and were extremely pleased the person behind the counter knew exactly what we were asking for. She assigned a guide who took us to the cave entrance and was well versed with the questions we asked. Even though we didn't have time for the tour, this one has earned a favorite point since it is extremely apparent the CO has worked with the personnel at this site to ensure all cachers visiting this location can claim their smiley. Well done!!! Email with the required answers to follow!! TFTEC!! 24hawki Clinton, Iowa	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave
cneumann98	Found it	5/25/2014	24hawki and I were headed north towards home after the festivities of Geowoodstock XII. Her suggestion was to hit Hannibal on the way, so we got ourselves ready for a whirlwind afternoon in Mark Twain's city. I visited this cave YEARS ago when I was little, but it was 24hawki's first visit. I think I'm going to have to take my entire family back here and go camping and spelunking! The folks at the counter were very helpful and quickly had us getting the information (and picture) that we needed. A very well-done earthcache, indeed!

bucknuts	Found it	5/25/2014	[blue]It was GeoWoodstock weekend. This was my first ever GeoWoodstock event, kinda still kick myself for not going when it was in Seattle. Met up with the normal cast of characters TEAM KUMI...Louinliberty, Hockabee, Baad Daata, FWIA, Busterbabes and me. Of course Busterbabes did have her daughter and sweet looking 2 month old grandchild along. Just a crazy weekend...some foreshadowing happened early Friday night at the Flash Mob when several hundred people convene for the 15 minutes. Then one of the tenants comes screaming out and yelling that the group was on private property. I threw my nerf football at Monrose and got the heck out of there before the popo came. Speaking of screaming, then on Saturday a non-cacher was yelling at a cacher in the parking lot for taking pictures of cars. I thought to myself, lady you better get ready not only are people taking pictures of TB's on the back of cars, but just wait. When you cross that bridge people will be taking pictures of t-shirts, badges, tattoo's and all kinds of number combinations. Team KUMI ate two nights at the Texas Road House in St. Charles. The first night we celebrated FWIA birthday. She got up in the saddle and I was glad she didn't have a whip or she might have smacked me. But timing is everything as she was eating her ice cream and I cautioned her about what might happen if she ate too much of it. First night Hock's meat wasn't to her desire, second night she ordered it in size instead of ounces. Second night half the table missed their sweet potato. Saturday morning did the northern bike trail. Go figure I have about 4 miles to make it to St. Charles and I have a flat tire. So I had to walk the bike the rest of the way. Hit two events then went to the local bike shop to get it fixed. The guy said "Can you leave it for 2 hours", I replied "Not Today". Got it fixed so we could do the southern bike section later in the day. While doing that one, I somehow got myself inside a gated golf community and couldn't get out. They had gates to get out. Eventually, I asked a guy mowing his yard how do I get out of this place. He gave me the directions and off I went. Whew...that was 20 minutes that I'm not sure how I did that. Met the fine folks of Determined2 on the southern portion of the trail and got to talk some Buckeye talk...sweet. Make sure to wear long pants and shirt for this trail as the poison ivy is thick. I did pick up two hitchhiker ticks while bike riding today. FWIA says she DNF'd a couple of caches and needs some help. Well after going back and discovering the first one was a coffee can. Huh??? You DNF'd a coffee can? Then the next one where she spent 15 minutes leaving with a frown we had in our hands in about 30 seconds. Later in the weekend, she spent 20 minutes on a bridge wheelchair accessible with a DNF...yep I found that one too. So the score just after this weekend is bucknuts 3, FWIA 0. Poor Louinliberty received some paperwork from Missouri finest at the event. Speaking of Missouri finest...wow they sure were out in force this weekend keeping the area safe. Thanks to all the people which hide the caches and hosted events for my first ever GeoWoodstock. It was awesome. Signed logs either bucknuts or Team KUMI.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

swr rat	Found it	5/22/2014	Found with the wife "the mouse" as we toured the area before heading down to St. Charles for GWXII. We came out to see the cave but decided to ship the tour as the wife doesn't do well on long distances (two total hip replacements on one side make it a bit tough for her, but she has survived cancer). Checked out the shop took some pictures and headed on down the road. It is no wonder that geothermal cooling is so effective after feeling the breeze coming out of the cave door. Will get email answers out soon. TFTC SL	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1B2F4_mark-twain-cave

Unitzoid	Found it	11/30/2013	Thirty on the Thirtieth #9 (12:25 PM) Walking up to the cave's entrance, I couldn't help but smile. This certainly seemed like an awesome place to explore! Alas, time would prevent a thorough examination of this cave and its passages. I'd have to settle for making observations of the exterior. Some questions remained unanswered, though, so I sought the help of an employee. Answers were cheerfully given as was aid in taking a photograph at the entrance. A few of the artifacts inside the gift shop were looked over before it was obvious Atomic Goat's Breath and I needed to continue on our way. Thank you for highlighting this geographic feature!

She was not allowed to answer tourists questions. But she did allow me to go out the door to the cave area so that I could look around and perhaps find a couple of my answers (I did).

Foundinnj	Found it	1/26/2019	I had a rare day where my Geocaching buddy was not able to cache with me. At that point, I go for something with lots of hiking. I looked around and spotted the Sussex branch trail and the bike trail. I left South Jersey around 5 am and got to the parking spot around 7:30 am. It was 18 degrees when I started and warmed up to 30 by the time I ended my hike. I parked and headed north then did the loop around the lake on the bike trail. After that I ended up on the rail trail and headed north to the end and worked my way back to the car. I ended up hiking over 9 miles in about 5 hours. It was very enjoyable being here. Great views and a nice river to walk along. I left around 12:30. I ended up finding everything except one cache, bummer. A couple of them gave me a hard time. Glad there were hints for most of them. My GPS is always off in this area. Not used to looking through rocks and leaves for caches. Thanks for placing this cache for all to find.

KanoeBillder	Found it	8/28/2018	I waited til I reached the side trail before turning towards GZ. The trail did lead very close to GZ. There was a bit of poison ivy nearby and once there after a short search I had the cache in hand. The container was in good shape and I signed in on the dry log. Thanks for placing this one by the nearby mine openings.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6P49Z_the-ogden-mine-railroad
DFP1	Found it	7/30/2018	Sad to say this was our last cache on the trail for the day but only because this was the last one I had loaded into my GPSr. Didn't know how far my partner would want to hike so I just loaded the first few caches on the trail. We would have done at least a few more. Next time I'll load everything! Headed to Byram to try a few caches along Jefferson lake.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6P49Z_the-ogden-mine-railroad
klizich	Found it	7/26/2018	Out doing the trail today and catching a mile stone. Took a side trail to get to this one and had to dodge downed trees. I think the recent rain may have toppled a few.

BriGuyNY	Found it	10/28/2017	With LabRat, cdparker1 (and mom), and DeathlyHallows, we had been discussing that some locations really don't live up to their title or description. This one has a cool title and description, but the location? Eh... just don't expect anything too extravagant... LOL. It was still a good side-trek from the main trail though, and with me in the lead, I actually grabbed this one! That felt really great. Signed and replaced, we then returned to the trail just a few minutes later. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6P49Z_the-ogden-mine-railroad

cdparker1	Found it	10/28/2017	Received a text from BriguyNY asking if we wanted to meet him for doing this series of caches before the event. We met him and Labrat at the other end and hitched a ride back to here to start the day. While in the parking lot we were first approached by gworol then found his wife Kathy and then The Deathly Hallows pulled in. We added TDH to the mix and after finding this one, we all headed out on the Sussex Branch Railroad! I love the descriptions and history that is detailed on the cache pages. We had a nice slow pace with BriguyNY still on the mend from back surgery. It is great to see him out and about. The pace allowed many photos to be taken from our gang. Labrat was our retriever for Mile Post #51. I gave him a hand getting back up. We hit this one after MP51 and after a couple of non-starts, we zeroed in on the correct spot. The funny think was that TDH, from up on the trail, directed us right to it as his eagle eyes could see it. I replaced better than found and asked for confirmation from TDH that he could no longer see it. We continued our trek to the Sussex Mine RR and were hoping to see some mining action near the cache. No mines here but another smiley to add to the collection. I have forgotten which one this was but overall was a fun trek. The Jimmies was easy to remember as I pondered where I would put it vs. where it was as I can be quite devious and demanding of my searchers. You were much nicer than me! We had joked that we were hoping for another good location to match the description, ie, some sort of mine....again we did not see it but enjoyed the walk out here.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6P49Z_the-ogden-mine-railroad

So many caches around to make this milestone, but today we choose and old school hike, spelunking and signing. What a beautiful area on this cold morning, what an awesome place for to grab some caches. Starting to see more and more signs of life around, but still nobody on the trails. Not sure that anyone makes it out of this alive, be we will see. As we continue on we start hearing something fast moving to our left. What is this new noise, two beasts to deal with. And it starts a small climb here.... TFTC ACT	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC23ZT4_on-the-way-to-the-cave
Quarter-Master	Found it	1/23/2017	We came out this weekend, a caravan of cachers to conquer the newest TN Geocaching attraction, the SCTTA Geotour. We cached from Friday afternoon through Sunday night to complete this tour, granted with lots of detours along the way, but we got it done, and with only one DNF. I must say, I have enjoyed both this and the Jack Geotour immensely, in fact they are some of my favorite or should I say most enjoyed Geocaching experiences. MillasMommies12, Diggin' Up Bones, Puzzled Lady, Black•dot and myself had a blast touring the history and culture of Middle Tennessee, as it is so different than even Knoxville and Oak Ridge from which we hail.

EagleHeart7	Found it	9/4/2016	Clarksville Tn was full of anticipation this morning as 8 of us in a group headed toward Alabama looking forward to riding the rail. We planned this trip 2 weeks ago but after looking at the weather we postponed our trip until today. All logs were signed either with our names or as KTAG CREW. We replaced logs as needed and some containers were broken so we replaced those also. Thank you for placing hints as some were needed to make the find. Thank you for placing and maintaining these caches for us to find today it was an adventure we are likely not forget to soon. (Lots of Caching over the last couple of months has delayed my logging. Sorry for the delay.)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC23ZT4_on-the-way-to-the-cave

Beekeeper99	Found it	9/4/2016	After completing the Richard Martin Trail with a group of cachers from Tennessee as we drove down to Northern Alabama. Our group of 8 tackled the 10.2-mile RMT by bicycle. This was a great series of caches that were well maintained. There were a few along the way that our group replaced logs for or for the caches that were obviously missing, we placed new containers. The coordinates and hints for this series of caches were spot on and caused us very little difficulty. Granted, it helps when you have 8 sets of eyes checking for containers. After finishing up the RMT, we still had some time available to grab some caches in in Athens and in Tennessee, so to help another cacher out with a challenge we went to find a MTCBSA cache to complete the MTCBSA Challenge Cache (GC2F5DA). This was the goal for this next stage in our journey. There were few more caches in the vicinity so we went for it. TFTC #5103	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC23ZT4_on-the-way-to-the-cave
JT3Halls	Found it	9/4/2016	I have been pondering how to tackle this trail for three years now because there are two geocaches with specific words in the names that I needed to find to complete a challenge cache I had already found the final and signed the log book. Now was the time to tackle the Richard Martin Trail with a group of diehard cachers from Tennessee as we drove down to Northern Alabama. Our group of 8 tackled the 10.2-mile RMT by bicycle. This was a great series of caches that were well maintained. There were a few along the way that our group replaced logs for or for the caches that were obviously missing, we placed new containers. The coordinates and hints for this series of caches were spot on and caused us very little difficulty. Granted, it helps when you have 8 sets of eyes checking for containers. After finishing up the RMT, we still had some time available to grab some caches in Tennessee, so I talked the KTAG Crew into finding a required MTCBSA cache to complete the MTCBSA Challenge Cache (GC2F5DA). They all agreed and off we went for an adventure of a different kind. It turns out that finding this cache prompted us to continue our journey and become heroes.

Also my first time exploring this part of the park since the new trail construction. Last time I was here these were all earthen trails.

DelicateFlower & Tim	Found it	5/5/2019	This is our first EC in Missouri. We walked up the path and then off the path to the cave. It was muddy in places but we made it without slip sliding away. A young mom and her son followed us. We explained about geocaching and she was very interested. She tried to put the app on her phone but the internet was found. We pointed to where Tim placed the thermometer. The 10 minutes went by fast talking to her. Tim went back to pick up thermometer and told me degrees. We then went back down to our car which was parked by the answers we needed to complete your EC. I collected the data and then we went to find a cache nearby. Thanks "bennet" for creating this interesting EC! Favorite!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
ROAD KILL!	Found it	12/8/2018	I love visiting big caves such as Cliff Cave.

The Weasel	Found it	10/15/2016	Out with Croling, C4!, and L7! aka "Team Freal" for a fun filled weekend at Geocoinfest. The weather was perfect for grabbing all sorts of smileys. We prepared well in advance solving puzzles and picking out caches we wanted to grab for this weekend. We completed a few geoarts, several puzzles, some WIG's, some multis, some letterboxes, and of course some tradtionals. In the end, we rounded up around 250 caches and some great stories along the way. Geocoinfest was a blast. I'm glad I left my wallet in the car otherwise I would have gone braoke buying coins. For the eartcaches and virtuals that were found that needed to have answers sent to the CO's, those have been sent by another member of our group. TFTC!!!

Smokey48	Found it	10/10/2016	OCW 1Sammy to celebrate Earthcache Day. This is the closest earthcache to by house and I had been saving it for when I needed a close by cache. Today was a nice cool day and I wanted to take a chunk more out of the park and introduce CC to !Sammy. Heading to the cache, we met Detering coming down with a friend and several kids. He told us his digital thermometer was acting up and he couldn't get reading so he joined us back to the cave. While waiting for the ten minutes, he regaled us with several interesting caching stories. TFTC, and all the cave background bennet. It's nice to know stuff but it still won't get me into any cave (bad Boy Scout caving experience). Answers sent and picture is with 1Sammy's log. I'm on the left side.

Reetaville	Found it	10/9/2016	Given this whole park is named after the cave, I expected signage leading to it to be prominent. Such is not the case. I did eventually find a trail and Had a pleasant walk out to the cave on a sunny crisp morning. There was not a perceptible temp difference because it was a cool morning. I'm in from Illinois visiting an old friend for the weekend. Lucky thing to have such a cool EC nearby as I was heading out of town.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
Detering	Found it	10/9/2016	OCW Nail, his kids and 3/4 of my kids. Our thermometer died on us on the way up to the cave. Luckily we ran into another group of cachers on the way back down to the parking lot, so we headed back to get our required temperature readings. Without an actual container to find the kids lost interest quickly and headed back to the parking lot with Nail. I stayed behind and swapped caching stories while we waited for the thermometer to settle. After taking all of the required measurements, photos and locating the proper information, we thankfully headed into the park to find "real" geocaches according to the kids.

PibAndPog	Found it	10/1/2016	Thanks found it with G and Geodoge. This was Geodoge's first visit to this park and my first visit to the cave portion of the park. Had rained the days previous so everything was slippery and a bit muddy so I was quite glad i had worn my hiking boots for the trek. We waded through some small creeks, walked over rocks and climbed up to see the cave entrance. Geodoge gave everything a good sniff. I took some pics. GEOffreyCACHE's scientific readings revealed that there was only a 2 degree difference between the ambient temperature and the cave temperature. 70° outside and 68° at the mouth of the cave. Thanks for the cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
GEOffreyCACHE	Found it	10/1/2016	In looking for somewhere pet-friendly to get some exercise this Saturday morning, I suggested Cliff Cave park because we visited it once years ago, but didn't see the cave, sticking instead to the river trail to the south and scoring our highest day of geocache finds ever. Today, I just wanted to make sure we got to the cave and since I had scouted the area beforehand, I knew I needed to bring a thermometer for the temperature reading as well. Unfortunately, the thermometer I had needed a new battery, so we made a special stop on the way go get that. It was pretty easy to find the answers for the questions, and it was a not-to-strenuous hike to the mouth of the cave. My scientific readings revealed that there was only a 2 degree difference between the ambient temperature and the cave temperature. 70° outside and 68° at the mouth of the cave. We had fun, took some pictures, and were glad as we crossed the slippery-stoned stream that we didn't wear flip-flops, like some others we saw did. It was a fun morning. My selfies didn't come out so well, but I'll post the best one. TFTFEC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

JanS03	Found it	6/15/2016	Doing some local caching with IBEW Ret. This was our first cache of the day. Just about the time we were ready to head for the cave the skies opened up and the rains came down. Rather than just wait for the rain to let up we placed the thermometer on the grass in front of the truck for the required amount of time. Soon after that the rain let up and we headed to the cave. There was just enough rain to make the mud slick. We made it OK tho, and took pictures while waiting for the thermometer to get a reading of the air temp coming from the cave. Then we continued to the interpretive display and got the required info from it. Thanks, Bennet, for a fun and interesting earthcache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

eravau	Found it	10/12/2014	(#2,700) Even though I love earthcaches… as can be seen by my 50+ finds… I had been putting off this one for a day where it would help meet some other requirement besides just a smiley. With today's souvenir available… I decided today was that day. On top of that… I wanted to make my 2,700th find something besides a typical find… so that made this an even better candidate for today's outing. So I drove almost an hour to the trailhead and then made the short hike through the shallow stream that was flowing today… in the light, misty rain. I gathered the requested info and took a few pictures before making the drive back. I got back [b]almost[/b] in time… but missed half of the first song of my daughter's choir concert. But I'm happy that I had time to spend a little while in the woods today… rain or no rain. Thanks for maintaining this cache, bennet!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

WadeLori	Found it	9/12/2014	Working on a 7 day challenge and needed a non traditional. I live nearby and I've just never gotten around to doing this earthcache. Day seemed to fit the bill. Meatball ( my dog and hiking partner) had a good time exploring the hills and the creek while I waited for the thermometer to do its thing. Thanks for a reason to visit this local treasure again.

BeaverRetrievers	Found it	8/31/2014	So cool (pun intended). Gets a favorite point from us. Beautiful day - just a little hot. Out caching with parents (moosefinders). Needed to get a cache for the august souvenir (yes, we procrastinate). What a lovely park and it was nice to take a break from work and remodeling the house to do this. Email will be sent with answers. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
Capn Sea Bert	Found it	8/24/2014	Nickel01 needed an earth cache for her 7 souvenirs of August and I have been wanting to get this one too so we decided to brave the almost 100 degree weather to get this cache. It felt so good at the cave entrance that I wanted to stay there. After giving our thermometer plenty of time to register the temperature we headed off to get the rest of the clues. I hiked in this cave as a kid back in 1992 before it was closed, it is sad that it is not open to the public anymore but still very cool. Thanks for setting this one up :)	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

Drunk Cacher	Found it	8/13/2014	Hi there !!!! Im not new to caching, I'm just new at logging them. I have been a tag-along(muggle) with a friend for about a year and she finally talked me into getting my own account. We got this one along with many others while on a run in the Cahokia/Dupo/Columbia area on a beautiful summer day. We needed to hit wally's for some wine so we figured we would grab a few in JB park. We have been here a couple times caching in the past year, I think we got most of them between all the trips here. She sent in the answers last time when she logged it. Thanks for taking the time to set this up for folks like us, it's a nice way to spend the day with a great friend. Peace..... DC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

Robcyn	Found it	7/2/2014	OCW Korriaan and Magpie27 in Cliff Cave today. We had been here before, but didn't bring a thermometer to take measurements, so we weren't able to complete it. This is a neat place to visit, and kind of "cool" that there is such a significant temperature drop outside the cave. If it wasn't for caching we would have never found this place. Posted a picture of Rob at the cave, and Cyn is in Mapie's picture. Thanks for the fun Earthcache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

korriaan	Found it	7/2/2014	Had a great day caching in Cliff Cave park with RobCyn and magpie27 (even if I did get some chigger bites from bushwacking). Finished off the day with a visit to the cave for this earthcache. We had fun looking at the cave and taking pictures around the area. We decided to have my little TB Marty the Minion get in on things too. He's such a great little helper...	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave

David	Found it	5/25/2014	11:27am #31604. Eggsilent4 and I took a 5 day, 8 state tour with a visit to GeoWoodstock XII in St. Charles, Missouri right in the middle. We stamped most logs as Team LaB! ([b]L[/b]ike [b]a[/b] [b]B[/b]oss[b]![/b]), while some were signed individually. The posted coords for the EC were on the way to the oldie traditional, and preparations have been made just in case. Caves are awesome. Didn’t see any bodies dumped here by the mafia. My answers have been emailed. Thank you for placing caches for us to find and enjoy.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
EggSilent4	Found it	5/25/2014	I joined with David for a 2000 mile circular trip to GWXII and back. We had a great time and enjoyed many cache finds. Already looking forward to next year! We walked past the cave on the way to the oldie up the hill. Then we made the short drive to get the rest of the needed information to put a bow on this one. Email and photo. TFTEC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
Nicooole	Found it	5/23/2014	Love a good Earthcache and this did not disappoint. We made the trek up to the cave entrance and spent sometime just checking this out. The walk up was fun to kind of follow the creek up. After doing what we needed to do here we made the climb up the hill there probably was an easier way but I don't do that apparently and when I got back there were people in the cave cleaning up the graffiti in the area. Thanks for the EarthCache. Email has been sent.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1QMQ6_cliff-cave
royalsfan	Found it	5/23/2014	We were in the area for another cache and of course we couldn't pass up an EC. There were some kind souls getting rid of the graffiti at gz. Nicooole loves her EC's.

WadeH	Found it	1/14/2020	Running errands nearby this morning, so decided to try these two earthcaches while I was here. On a side note - I was very happy the restrooms were open, clean, and working this time of year! I made my way to the cave and decided not to try to navigate into it even though I had a very bright flashlight with me. Will send answers to CO ASAP. Thanks for bringing me here!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4R0KT_charleston-cave

Road tripped to Ohio to spend some time with my cousins, who humor me and earn smiles with me. Beyond thankful for a gorgeous sunny summer day to be out and about after all the hours spent indoors with my nose in books. Successfully returned all of the jewels and cracked the vault code as a Detective in Mystery at the Museum—now it is back to caching! 6 bugs are swimming with me into this cool cave.

fuzziebear3	Found it	10/13/2018	Had a fun day at Charleston Falls Preserve, and learned a little geology while I was there. How neat that one can crawl back into this cave as desired. It was quickly dark in the cave, but I had brought a flashlight so that I could check out the area. But I found that crawling or duck walking was a bit uncomfortable, so I didn't explore all the way back, but it was very interesting. It was also fun because I had met up with spider1158 and his daughter, and we had a fun day exploring the park together. Thanks for setting up this earthcache here!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4R0KT_charleston-cave

But before dropping him off at the airport, we determined to spend the time before he left together having fun, and so we explored this new-to-us park. We enjoyed our visit, & what a cool little cave! Mrs. boxen-hunters was the one to venture in, and wished she'd brought a headlamp so she could have explored even farther back than she did.

TwizTAR	Found it	7/17/2017	I had planned on doing this EC with my son and wanted to get it done for a few reasons. The first reason is because this is a beautiful area and the work Arby Gee put into this. The second was to try to log this before it got archived because of the recent passing of the CO. "RIP"! I know sending answers is pointless at this point and I'm not logging the find here for the numbers but I'd like it to be here in my stats to better find and look back on. I may just copy this write up and try to continue on with this earthcache. Thanks again Arby Gee for creating this.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15P0N_deer-lick-cave

eyewise	Found it	11/26/2015	Kbull and I came out today to enjoy the beautiful weather hiking and caching. Neither of us have ever been to this area to do either so we were pretty excited to spend our Thanksgiving Day here. We found several caches and would have completed the entire loop if I hadn't fallen and broken my leg about mid day. Luckily we were close to the road by this time and the first car stopped to give us a ride back to our vehicle so we could go to the ER. The break was certainly inconvenient, but it is not bad and is healing nicely. I look forward to redeeming my fall as soon as I can and finish off this park. It's beautiful here. Thanks for the cache. Answers on the way!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15P0N_deer-lick-cave

Dove78	Found it	9/5/2015	Out on a two day caching trip with Tprints and MommyTP. This was one of 24 earth caches we did this weekend. I found this very interesting how the salt becomes available for the deer to lick off the stone walls. On leaving the cave we noticed on the boulder to the left that the sun was reflecting off the water making a ripple pattern on the boulder - that was very cool as well. Thanks for developing this one - I really enjoyed it. Answers have been sent for our group.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15P0N_deer-lick-cave

North Coast Cacher	Found it	8/30/2012	Found earthcache. In Ohio for a vacation over the weekend from Kansas - am originally from MAdison, OH. Anyway, after finding some earthcache along the towpath trail in Cuyahoga Valley NAtional Park and riding my bicycle, discovered that I had just enough daylight left to find/finish this particular earthcache. Must say, it took longer to find the parking area that it did the cache. So, finally make it to the parking lot and I commence the short hike to GZ. Noticed a sign warning people about coyotes - thought that that was ammusing for in Kansas we don't even pay attention to coyotes, they are treated worse than roadkill. Eventually made it to the cave just as my bad knee decides to give out just a bit - gimping along for a while. Neat cave and trails!!!! Enjoyed this earthcache. E-mailed owner answers to questions. Favorites bound.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15P0N_deer-lick-cave

Most visitors took the shortcut that went directly from the overlook to the cave. My kids were afraid of coyotes, so they were better behaved than usual. Sending the answers soon.

FLtravelers	Found it	10/9/2019	After finishing up the nearby Boone Pond Series #42 cache, our intrepid little group headed over here to stretch our legs. My initial plan was to just go for the earthcache. I was easily convinced to get em all. The dirt trails were clearly set up for some serious biking. Without a map they were difficult to figure which one would take us to the cache. We soon found it most expeditious to bushwack between them at times. Last but not least as they say. After finding all the traditionals, we made it to the cave. While some were encouraging a deeper exploration, nobody did. We had a great time exploring the park and getting em all. Great spot.

arklucher	Found it	12/25/2018	Going back through a lot of drafts saved over the last year to finish posting finds. Found this on Christmas day when family was visiting from Florida. Took my nephew out to this park and thought he would enjoy this earthcache. He is unfortunately not used to being out in nature so this was a fun hike out in the woods and he was a little nervous about going into the cave(he is 9 yrs) but he did peak his head in!

NeverSeenGene	Found it	10/15/2018	Big fun with this one! Maybe more than the CO intended, and certainly a lot more than I expected! In the first place, I never really intended to do this geocache. After messing around this morning with a mostly-missing mini-power run a bit to the southeast of this great park, I came over here from some quick woods-caching therapy. I parked at a (the?) trailhead, picked out the nearest hide that meets my desired difficulty/terrain minimums and took off through the woods. Like I say, I never intended to do this one because it hurts the cumulative average of my finds but, once that other one was done, I started paging down on my GPS and by mistake I clicked this one as found. No biggie, I thought, but I'd better walk over there and sign the log in it. Ha, ha! I got to the GZ without any trouble and, with no flashlight, crawled all around and up and down in the cave trying to find a container. Finally I came back out to daylight and read the cache description. Duh! Earthcache! So I took a couple of selfies and got one that is halfway decent, and I "made up" the answers to the questions for the geocache. I've already messaged those--don't ask about badly I managed to send the message in about five parts--and so, thanks for the fun!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1WVZP_winged-deer-park-small-cave
PayMeCache	Found it	5/25/2018	Catching up on my logs from earlier this year. Found this while on six day sabbatical. Flew in to Nashville, Tennessee from Denver, Colorado to start my journey. I headed north to Indiana to grab two (2) year 2000 caches before heading east to the U.S.'s first Giga event in Ohio. From there I rounded out a total of 13 states, 12 of which were new to me before making it back to catch my return flight home from Nashville, TN. I ended up over 3,400 miles driven in six days, fixed a flat tire myself on the rental care in the middle of West Virginia on a Sunday, Memorial Day weekend when no place was open to help. Pushed ahead of a Tropical Storm Alberto that I started to play games with me in NC south to Mississippi. I missed my companionship of a couple regular geocachers on my epic trips like this but can proudly state I ended up with the following: 12 new states obtaining a geocache 9 webcams Completed 4 geoarts Found over 20 Earth Caches Grabbed worlds OLDEST mystery cache Grabbed worlds OLDEST multicache Attended USA's FIRST Giga event Signed my John Hancock on nine (9) year 2000 caches Grabbed many 2001, 20002, 2003 and 2004 caches to bring me that much closer to a 4x Jasmer. Found GC38AFZ - Tunnel of Love on May 27, 2018 using Cachly for iOS. Some may call me seriously mentally ill. Some may state that I am in a state of mind that prevents social interaction. Some may say I am in a state of mind that prevents normal perception and or behavior. I prefer to say that I tend to do the same thing over and over again, but I expect different results. That being said, I believe we only live one life and I am trying to make the best of it. I thank you, Wendy for placing a fun geocache to fuel my "insanity" or addiction as I call it. I appreciate you bringing me here so that I can try and sign my alias on a piece of paper that you have hidden. I look forward to finding more of your geocaches. I also look forward to potentially finding geocaches with you one day and sharing stories of our insanity... I mean hobby or addiction? Cheers! Some may call me seriously mentally ill.

Nicht jeder Cache kann allen gefallen, oder nicht jeder findet die Gegend toll, oder den Behälter super etc. Ich vergebe auch keine Favoritenpunkte nur weil ein Cache schon sooooo viele hat, das Punkte vergeben bleibt mir überlassen und nur wenn ich dem entsprechend empfinde für diesen Cache, der bekommt einen. Wenn ich eine Cachserie mache, ich kann nun mal nicht bei jedem Cache: juhu tolle Filmdose, jähh geiler Petling, oh toller Ast, wau imposanter Sein, gigantischer Ausblick, schönes Gewässer und bla bla bla schreiben, gibt es einen Einheitslog...

JungleJanie	Found it	4/2/2018	Today the Monday caching Crew consisting of Firefighter Skippy, Marbleguy, Bgunnells and myself, traveled to western CT and NY thru a snow storm. It snowed for the first 6 hours of the day and we ended up with 5 to 6 inches of fresh snow in some places. The sun came out for about 30 minutes in the afternoon and it got warm enough to loose the coat and much of the snow melted! We started in the dark and ended in the dark and cached much longer because of the increased daylight. Most caches we a quick find and there were a few that eluded us today but we still managed to find around 64. We signed the logs as MCC. I was very beat by the end of the day from the cold and slept well! Thank you so very much for hiding this fun cache!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1PYQQ_old-mine
Marbleguy	Found it	4/2/2018	The snow was falling and at 05:45 I get a phone call asking about how I feel about heading out into the storm and caching. The forcast was for the snow to continue until around noon time and then clearing skies. What to do? Go Caching of course. The plan for this Monday Caching Crew (Myself, BGunnells, JungleJanie, and Firefighter Skippy) as put forth over the weekend was still a go and off we went. This week week had the area around Danbury Ct and west into the NY area around I-84. Even though the snow was several inches at times, we still managed to find most of the caches that we set out to get. A few DNFs along the way but a decent 64 finds by all made for another great day. I would like to take the time here to thank all of the cache owners that take time out of their caching time to place the cache that I found today.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1PYQQ_old-mine
BGunnells	Found it	4/2/2018	I was out with the MCC (Monday Caching Crew) again today. Today's crew consisted of me, JungleJanie, Marbleguy and Firefighter Skippy. I left Massachusetts at 5 am for a meet up with the group, our goal was a day of caching from Newtown CT west into NY along the I-84 corridor. Before I was out of Massachusetts it had begun to snow but after a quick conference call we decided to continue with our plan. Although we did experience some heavy snowfall during the morning with significant accumulation it had pretty much stopped by mid-day. The new snow did cause some problems on a few caches and generally slowed us down but it was still a fun day and we were able to find 60 plus caches, with a few DNF's and a few we didn't attempt. Thanks to all the CO's for placing and maintaining these caches for us to find.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1PYQQ_old-mine
Firefighter Skippy	Found it	4/2/2018	My name is Firefighter Skippy and I am a cacheaholic. If caches are out there, I will try to find them. The MCC hit's the road once again. Myself, bgunnells, JungleJanie and Marbleguy had an early morning conference call when we woke up and saw the snow and decided that we wouldn't let that stop us. Along our drive to our starting area of Newtown we encountered some moderate snow fall conditions and 2 to 6 inches of wet snow until @noon time when it stopped. By evening most of the snow was next to nothing to @2 inches. We did manage to find @65 caches though DNF'd another 6 before heading home in the evening. Some of our finds we quick while a few took us several minutes and review of past logs to find something to help us along. We also replaced some logs when needed. I would like to take the time here to thank all of the cache owners that take time out of their caching time to place the cache that I found today.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1PYQQ_old-mine

wesi	Found it	4/5/2015	I had hoped to be able to get a closer look at the rocks that had been mined here, but no, the sinkhole is easily 20m deep, and there is no (safe and legal) way of getting anywhere near.

Tundra Wolf	Found it	6/9/2013	As the Southern Tier of NY Wolf Pack (including the Awesome Aussie Shepherds Jewel & Luna) was heading for <b>another milestone</b>, this time it was #5600 , I began looking for a dog or wolf themed cache to do to celebrate and make that milestone cache. My buddy Mrmacman2U did the driving today, and had his lovely geodog Meeka along too! I found this one in the area called <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=ad63e1d7-c844-4094-9644-7a911e8f079e">"Who Let The Dogs Out? Woof, WOOF!"</a> Now granted, Carmel is a bit of a drive from wolf country, but that one is part of an entire line of caches along a very nice level rails-to-trail pathway. It would mean about a 5 to 6 mile RT walk, but after the last few weekends of mountain hiking for our smileys, I thought the "<i>little wolves</i>" and I could use a break from the higher terrain and do some nice easy ones......Riiight ! Some of those were not only trickier than average to find and of clever construction, but the terrain was right on up there as well because few were right along the pavement ! Oh well, caches like these keep my D/T averages up at least ! We got a late start, but ended up at about 10:30PM with another <b>FORTY-THREE</b> caches all told !<p><p>We took a short detour up the side street from the rail-trail to grab this one. Thanks for the history lesson on the old mine! I'm not a fan of LGH type caches (of course, I "cache 'em all" though ).....but this type of guard rail cache is cool because it showed me this old mine infrastructure! Thanks for the history lesson on this place! I was saying to my buddy that I bet it was DEEP because the color of the water.....600' .....wow! TFTH!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1PYQQ_old-mine

burgo78	Found it	12/30/2019	On a 8 week tour from North Queensland, Australia 🇦🇺 and looking to pick up interesting, old or highly favourited caches each day. There were plenty of briars at GZ but I was able to skirt around the edge and collect a sample. Sadly no gold today but I like earthcaches that don’t hurt my brain so that’s worth as much.

skeletor10	Found it	5/28/2017	Found while out on a long weekend cache run across North Carolina with RAHNNERGOTHUC. Our primary goal was to attend GeoWoodstock and to get North Carolina's oldest cache. Our trip started in Charlotte, and we made our way to Asheville and then to Murphy, before heading back to Charlotte. Along the way, we targeted a few interesting caches in each county, as well as virtuals and oldies. The answers to the earthcaches and virtuals were submitted for the both of us by RAHNNERGOTHUC. Unless otherwise noted, all caches were found in good shape, log was signed, and cache returned to its hiding spot. Thank you for contributing to this awesome adventure! Mining for gold?! I am definitely in for that! My enthusiasm quickly waned after a few minutes of finding nothing. RAHNNERGOTHUC helped me find what I needed to qualify for the earthcache, although gold in the area turned out to be a rumor!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC191NH_boylston-gold-mine

I wanted something special; had been wanting to visit this site for awhile, so am glad there are some caches here--especially an earthcache or two. Today (along with tomorrow) is International Earthcache Day, so this was the perfect trifecta: museum visit, earthcache visit with souvenir, and a milestone. Thank you so much for setting up this earthcache. My daughter, laurav16, has sent the answers for both of us. I am giving a favorite point. I will eventually add a photo or two. #2000	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14DFZ_ancient-mine-site

We took two of the trails and toured the museum. A note to all cachers - the museum now closes the second weekend of October so tomorrow is their last day open until the first weekend in May. The park itself is open year round and caches are accessible. Saw several large flint specimens in the park and along the trails. Also nice place for a picnic - when it is not 45 degrees. We will definitely be back!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14DFZ_ancient-mine-site

schwandt	Found it	5/24/2018	My GeoWoodstock Giga roadtrip included seven days on the road, traveling through and caching in six states (Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Virginia) that included 270+ cache finds in 60+ counties, with the most popular type being Earthcaches, followed by virtuals, unknowns, and lab caches. In addition to the Giga, I attended another event in Newark, Ohio. Day 2 took me west and north through West Virginia into eastern Ohio and then across to the Columbus area. My focus was on expanding my counties cached in both states while making it to visit with a longtime friend in the evening. I was able to achieve both objectives while visiting a high number of the Earthcaches and virtual caches. I really like this area and am quite pleased that the Earthcaches brought me here.

Ericles	Found it	11/17/2019	#4338. I'm inadvertently picking on your caches today ON! I had been by this one before but it had a sting of DNFs so I gave it a pass. Seeing fresh maintenance I made sure to stop by this time and I'm glad I got a closer look at the mine. The find was pretty quick too and I signed in as "FTF" on the new log. :smile: All is well naturally. TNLNSL and replaced as found.

Laurel Tree	Found it	10/23/2017	Found while exploring the Watchung Reservation with KathieTravels on an unseasonably warm October day. This one caused us a bit of confusion.

The last one for us after hiking from the nature center to Feltville and back again. We hoofed 8 miles grabbing 21 caches. Fantastic day for us since we are not numbers cachers.

I said to HowerPower how bad do you want a smiley as we were getting tired and that last 60 or 70 feet was looking like more than that at this point in the day.

OReviewer	Post Reviewer Note	5/6/2016	I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled for a period of time well in excess of the period of "a few weeks" as contemplated by the cache guidelines published on Geocaching.com. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it (using the archive listing link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

Ginmar	Found it	5/31/2015	Out for some hiking and caching on a warm Spring morning. I must have found the easiest was down into the ravine and was greated by a nice rock cliffside. Searching at the coordinates didn't yield the cache and the hint didn't mean anything to me. But previous logs convinced me to press on. I expanded my search radius. [Is it really a "radius" if the path in the ravine is linear?] The cache appeared. Nice hide. Worth a favorite point. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13W41_old-copper-mine

EnjoyLife2	Found it	4/15/2015	Found it twice. Well coming from the Cape, I had a little extra time before going to work for an all nighter. I need a cache that was large enough for a TB. Also one that would be fun finding. For sure this one was it. The cache was actually about 40+ feet using my GPS and my cell GPS. I was ready to call it a day and look for another spot to drop the TB, but after reading other logs and seeing what the container looked like, I tried again and expended my search area. Well I got excited finding it, that I logged the cache, took pictures and left as it was getting dark. Guess what ! I forgot to put the TB in. I didn't realize it until I got to the car. It was too dark to go back. So before leaving back to the Cape, I made a quick stop to drop of my TB. TFTC. One of my favorites too.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13W41_old-copper-mine

ZaLiGa	Found it	11/9/2014	This one was a little more difficult to find. Didn't find it on our first try about a week ago, but then again it was getting dark and we gave up.

Merlin-K	Found it	11/8/2014	The coordinates for this one left me a little way off initially. After a bit of a search I felt that it just didn't seem right. Check of the hint and I thought I knew the answer. But the GPS didn't agree. So a quick internet search to make sure I wasn't getting mixed up with Billy the Kid. My recollection was correct (the number of times I have watched the film then it certainly should be). So that meant a bit of a scramble as we were too high up. At this point the large number of leaves on the ground, while beautiful, were also a hindrance, and there may have been more sliding on my backside than I would really like to admit to. once in the ravine then more searching. And at first i went the wrong way for the cache but the right way for an impressive rock face. Then back down. And growing frustration at struggling to find the cache. Constantly thinking of the hint I kept on looking. And then, suddenly, there it was. Always good to find an ammo can. Then had to find my way back UP. Which was almost as interesting as finding a way down. Left a sigitem. Logging through the rest of the world coin and the world geocacher US coin.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13W41_old-copper-mine
skibumz	Found it	10/26/2014	A lovely and colorful Fall day spent caching in and around the Watchung Reservation with friends Spatial Distortion and Zooming Boomers. The weather was just perfect and the foliage was all kinds of red's, yellow's and brown's. We hiked, we laughed, we listened to a marching band in the background, we battled thorns, we found caches and most of all we had fun ! On top of that SD reached a couple of milestones A not so fast find. Had to use the hint and then had to forget the GPS and use geosense to get to the cache. A neat spot. Thanks Old Navy for the hide and smiley.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13W41_old-copper-mine
Zooming Boomers	Found it	10/26/2014	Spent a spectacular fall Sunday caching in the Watchung Reservation with our favorite caching buddies, Spatial Distortion and skibumz. We walked a BUNCH of miles, enjoying the camaraderie and fall foliage. Lots of fun and lots of memories including walking through a horseshow, listening to a marching band, dealing with missing and broken cellphones, brambles beyond belief, donut trees and watching 4 plates of wings appear and disappear. Celebrated with SD on his double milestone. Good times with good friends. We enjoyed finding this cache. TFTH!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13W41_old-copper-mine

The weather was perfect. The sun was bright and brilliant and the breeze was blowing. Headed to Watchung Reservation to do some caching. There are puzzles here that I have had solved since 2007. Back then I was a newbie puzzle solver and I learned many things from the incredible puzzle masters here in NJ.

WickedLobstah	Found it	6/27/2014	Today was probably the most epic day of Geocaching I have had to date. Foundinnj picked me up around 6am to head upstate to do a cache run of a bunch of old and highly favorited caches. On the day we stopped at 3 different locations and found all 27 caches of the 27 that we looked for. We found 17 Traditional, 1 Multi, 3 Puzzle (2 field & 1 challenge), 3 Letterbox, 1 Virtual, 1 Earthcache, and 1 Whereigo! 4 of the caches were from 2001, and 6 had over 40 Favorite points! This was truly an unforgettable day that will be hard to top in the future. Had a blast and want to thank all the cache owners for maintaining their caches (for the most part)! This one was very tough to find. GPS got a bit crazy down here which made it even tougher. We were seriously scratching our heads wondering how we couldn't find an ammo can. Ended up reading through all the logs until we had an idea of where to look. Also, the boy scouts who last found this cache didn't close it and resulted in the contents getting pretty wet. We closed it properly and replaced, but this might need some attention.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC13W41_old-copper-mine
Foundinnj	Found it	6/27/2014	Out on a cache run with Wickedlobstah to Central and Northern New Jersey. (I really needed to take time to clear my head and this was the perfect way to do it.) We were after some old caches, caches with lots of favorite points, and to see different parts of the state. The weather was great today. We got lots of exercise walking to all these cool places. Thank you for placing all these caches. This one took a while. My GPS is having a bad day, but it finally directed us to the cache.

Ex1414	Found it	9/29/2019	My wife and I are in Clarksville for the weekend on the motorcycle and it is unseasonably hot today. It is supposed to be fall and our temperature gauge says that it is 104 degrees. We are both sunburnt and needed a cool place to get out of the sun before we ride back to Evansville closer to sunset. What better place to cool off than a 55 degree cave. And even better bonus is to get an earthcache as well. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

caverdon	Found it	7/15/2018	I had a free afternoon and evening for the first time in a long time, so I took advantage of it to get caches in a different area. For my mission I focused on several cache types and completing some challenges. It was a crazy weather type of day... sometimes it was raining hard, and other times it stopped for a while. I had to deal with water and slippery conditions in almost every place I visited. I arrived in the mid-afternoon to an empty parking lot except for one car. The rain had started again, and I guess that was keeping people away on a Sunday afternoon. I walked to the cave and passed one very wet family on their way back. They didn't have any rain gear, so they were completely soaked. I soon arrived at the cave entrance, and I was the only one there. Very impressive! I enjoyed wandering around, reading the signs and learning the history of this fascinating place. While I've been a caver for decades, I've never visited it before. So it was extra special to examine the entrance carefully for how it developed. I stayed around for about 15 minutes. The combination of the rain and the cold air from the cave made it a chilly place and slightly foggy. I got a few pictures, and made sure I had the answers needed for the EC. On my way back I met no one. Visitor center was closed, so I couldn't check it out. Maybe on a future visit! Thanks for this EC. Sending the answers after this log.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

Today, my sister and I spent some time (again) in Clarksville, experiencing more government incompetence. So, I decided to take her to check out an Earthcache, which she had not done yet. We somehow missed the visitor's center entirely, but enjoyed our walk to the cave entrance. The lake looked really strange, and now I see it is because some soil testing is being done to the lake bed.

We wonder into Missouri and Illinois to cherry pick a few earthcaches as well. Finished up with an earthcache in my own back yard here in Clarksville to get four earth's in four sates in a day ("WOW"). It certainly wasn't a numbers day but we go to see some pretty country. We also picked up a multi and a mystery along the way. Even got to avenge a DNF. Dished out a few favorite points, cause there were some great caches out there. Ran into some other members of the KTAG Crew who late in the afternoon who were also caching in the area. Took a pic and had a few laughs then headed our separate ways. Some of the log sheets were either stamped "KTAG Crew", signed our names or used initials depending on the size of the log. Thanks to all of the cache owners who hid geocaches for us to find. All of the geocaches were in good shape, unless otherwise noted and if it needed maintenance of any kind, we took care of it.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

Good caching friend Floaten called and asked if I wanted to make a quick run up to Clarksville Tenn to hit the Purple Heart trail and a few other PT in the area. ...and what answer was he expecting. . We loaded up and then thought up, a cool name for the trip. Floaten (F) And (A) KnKinCabot (K), yep FAK. We are by no means FAKE as our phones kept spelling! This appeared to be one happening place back in it's hay day! Thanks to all the COs who work hard at putting out caches and the maintaining them for people like us to come and find! .

flowten	Found it	4/6/2015	I planned a trip to Clarksville a few months back. I was stationed here from 1999 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq with the 101st. I loved this area but the army choose to move me away. I came up with a good caching friend KNKINCABOT. My user is Floaten so we decided to take the first letter of each our names with A (AND) to create FAK. When I spoke this user to my phone it translated FAKE. I assure you we are REAL geocachers. I have been to this site many times while I lived in the area. Brought my friend here to show him. I had never seen the water this low. I assume they drained the small lake/pond. This was one of many caches we hit this weekend. Thanks for placing and maintaining this cache. Answers have been sent.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

I'm retired from the U.S. army with a 100% disability, so there are many Earthcaches I'm unable to get to due to the terrain they are located in.

Papa Bear 204	Found it	5/6/2014	My dad and I did a little caching together in Tennessee. We had 5 different Icons for the day and came to Clarksville for this Earthcache. We read the signs about the snakes in park an then saw a small ringneck snake as we walked on the path. We were careful not to step on the little guy. We read the history of the cave, but were disappointed to find it had been sealed up. Still the history of the cave was very interesting. Thanks for the fun earthcache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

Bloodyprints	Found it	4/20/2014	First day of geocaching in a long time for the Bloodyprints due to deployments, work, and studies. Finally got some time to get out and wanted to visit Dunbar Caves for the first time. It's really too bad that the caves are blocked off for tours now, we've been in many underground caches and would have loved to crawl around in there. We took a nice walk around the lake and then to the museum and watched the movies. Noticed that the answers to the questions were in the first minute of the first movie, we'll email later. We were shocked to see that Dunbar Caves used to be such a happening place due to the cool temps. It's really sad that it's now just a shell of what it used to be. It's almost like the place is a cemetery now, so very very sad. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

CincinnatiSteve	Found it	2/16/2014	I wanted to go out caching in the nice weather, but for some reason I wasn't feeling too committed to it this day. Maybe I should have gone with my gut, because just outside Dover I fell into a speed trap. Yikes! First ever speeding ticket, and it's all thanks to geocaching. Oh well. You win some you lose some! :b I decided not to let it mar my day, and specifically went to this location, since Earth caches are my favorite cache type. I got to the park and made the short hike to the cave. It was closed, but I still got to enjoy the informative signs detailing the cave's history and formation, as well as view the video about its history in the visitor center. While here, I learned about White Nose Syndrome, a devastating disease afflicting bats in the area. As a result, I will construct bat-houses in the near future to hopefully aid our flying friends. Thanks for taking me to this neat cave! :)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache
HistDrew	Found it	1/5/2014	A great earthcache! I stopped by this one on the way out of town after a day of caching [see below]. I love cave-caches, and have a few of them myself. So this was a natural for me to stop at. So, for Xmas I asked for a day of caching—the same thing I ask for for my birthday. Basically it’s a day away from home, with my wife watching the little cachemonkeys while I go out and make a run somewhere. Today the run was to Clarksville to pick up some caches. I’ve made the New Year’s caching resolution to get to 100 each of Earthcaches, Virtuals, Mystery caches, and Multi caches. As of today I’m pretty close on the Virtuals, and today was the day to get a bunch of Mystery caches. I came to town, then, for the Purple Heart series, as well as a few other Virtuals, Mysterys, and Earthcaches. And a few traditionals. It was a very, very early start headed out from Bowling Green at 5am. This got me to the area before first light, unfortunately. But I got myself started and worked my way through both Purple Heart series’, and some others. I saw more police on this run than I’ve ever seen, and not one of them stopped to talk to me. That was nice. By mid-day it had started to rain, and it was cold. So I gave up on the last few caches, packed it up, and headed back to Bowling Green. A great day. Thanks to everyone in Clarksville for maintaining such great caches. This was earthcache number 39! TFTC!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

There was a trail around the lake and the unused concession stand was too. The bars over then entrance is what I remembered the most.

Hares Ear	Found it	6/22/2013	I really enjoyed this Earthcache. It was a short enjoyable walk with the shading canopy. The extra bonus was the welcomed air conditioning at the mouth of the cave. It would be fun to take the tour. Thanks for all the great information and for pointing out this location. Email has been sent.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

Rich & Lola	Found it	5/27/2013	This was an awesome earthcache, as we are big fans of caves. We were in town from Houston to visit family. I noticed this earthcache while on our way to get lunch. I had Rich take a detour so we could see the area and get the needed answers. The area is still worth the visit even though the cave is closed due to White Nose Syndrome that is effecting the bats. Thanks for the fun and thanks for bringing us here.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache
Night*Cacher	Found it	5/22/2013	Thanks for the cache. Too bad the cave isn't open for tours anymore. Maybe it will be when i return to Clarksville for my Daughters graduation in 2 years.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

illinitrekker	Found it	11/8/2012	Wow, what a cool place! I cannot believe this gem is tucked away in the middle of Clarksville. The history of this place, including the recreational aspects of it, is fascinating. I had to call my father and tell him about the Roy Acuff connection. He believes he heard about this on a television program. I was surprised to find turtles out on logs in the cool. They were not getting any sun at this point. The only regret I have is not being able to slip at least a little bit into the cave. I hope the bat disease problem clears up so tours can be restarted. I would love to take one. Required information e-mailed to CO.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

Rd King	Found it	3/30/2012	Accompanied my wife who attended a 1-day conference at APSU. That left me free for the day to do a little caching - darn the bad luck!!!!!!! This was my second stop on the Clarksville caching tour. After walking to GZ and taking a less than flattering picture, I headed to the Visitors Center. Arrived at about 0820 and even though the sign said their hours started at 0800, the door was locked. After 10 minutes or so a park ranger finally unlocked the door. Watched a video that provided much of the info I needed. Wanted to take a quick look at the museum but the ranger closed and locked the door before I could enter. Never did see the ranger again although I waited about 10 minutes for him to return. Think I have the anwers and will e-mail them shortly. I really enjoyed this EC and wish I was around when it was visited by the stars of the Grand Ol' Opry.

I'd visited here late last year close to sunset looking for other caches, but always wanted to come back again but was reluctant because the cave's been shut down. Hopefully it opens again soon. My family loved the area, I hunted around a little bit to find the answers to this cache, and found a nice new place for hikes and runs later.

We were hoping to catch a glimpse of some bats... but none were to be seen. It's unfortunate that they have closed to caves to public access/tours. This whole park is a beautiful place. We encountered numerous muggles walking 4-foots, lots of ducks, a goose, fish, and a chipmonk. What impressed me the most was just how cold that air was coming from the mouth of the cave. We really enjoyed our visit here. Along with visiting our Granddaughter, this cave made for a most memorable weekend.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

jadefalcon	Found it	7/14/2010	This Earthcache was definitely an enjoyable experience. I had been eyeballing it since I got into town, and just now had the opportunity to go over to it. It's a shame that we humans cause so much trouble with the poor bats that we can't enter the cave any more. I guess that's just the way it is. Email is en route.

mrpaseo	Found it	6/12/2010	Well, I thought I had this one already but when I looked on my iPhone it said I did not have it. I found out that the old one was retired, and this one was started. Looking at the requirements I found the three questions and went to find the answers... I could not locate them on any information posted within the building or on the sign outside. There are no longer tours due to the White Nose Syndrome that is killing the bats. That said, there are plenty of reasons to visit this site of which I provided many pictures for your enjoyment. What I did not read, was to earn credit, I would need a picture with me and my GPS... one problem with that... My GPS was my iPhone which was also my camera... and I went alone. Oh well, this is why I am posting a note rather than a smiley. If the owner of this cache says I can claim it, I will follow on with a smiley ;) On to the photos. Spoke with the owner, smiley approved ! This entry was edited by mrpaseo on Tuesday, 15 June 2010 at 15:42:28.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC10DYD_dunbar-cave-earthcache

cottage crew	Found it	7/24/2012	I found this today on my way home from Ottawa. As I was nonchalantly looking around for the cache, almost no one around but 2 ladies. They seemed concerned that I was looking for something (obviously I wasn not as casual as I thought). I told them I was looking for a cache and they knew what I was talking about and they really wanted to help me. So they joined the search. Hubby happily found it after about 20 minutes of searching. I can't believe I missed it as I looked in that very spot myself a few times. Anyway I really liked the mine tour and history. Thanks for the fun!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1GMB4_marmora-mine-lookout

-allenite-	Archive	10/25/2015	As there's been no cache to find for months, I'm archiving it to keep it from continually showing up in search lists, and to prevent it from blocking other cache placements. If you wish to repair/replace the cache sometime in the future (within 60 days), just contact us (by email), and assuming it meets the guidelines, we'll be happy to unarchive it.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCW6E0_mansfield-mine-disaster
-allenite-	Post Reviewer Note	9/18/2015	I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled for a period of time well in excess of the period of "a few weeks" as contemplated by the cache guidelines published on Geocaching.com. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it (using the [i]archive listing[/i] link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location. If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b]log a note to the cache[/b] (not email) within the next 30 days so I don't archive the listing for non-communication.

Triple_P	Found it	12/26/2019	Day 1 of a road trip covering Horse Cave, Nashville, Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, Alexandria, LA, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Tallahassee and other places. I am all for hiking caches. When you make them easy finds and ammo boxes, you have won me over. This place is great! I hiked all over the trails, taking in the beauty that nature has here. All of these will be getting favorite points from me. Across the bridge and into the trail system. Following the trails and picking these off one at a time. Did stage 3 first, then stage 2 and finally the posted coordinates. Neat educational info at all stops. The third and first were my favorite. Answers are in. Photo taken and uploaded.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2E3FB_lost-river-cave-and-valley-earthcache

caverdon	Write note	12/29/2018	Today I had the free time for one last geocaching road trip in 2018. I decided to focus on the area of KY around Bowling Green as it has been on my list for a while. Of course I picked up caches while traveling to/from the area. I left home around 6am and arrived back home at 11pm after 17 hours of caching. I picked up a variety of caches and saw many new places... it was a great caching road trip! I arrived at Lost River in the late morning and planned to spend a while here enjoying the area and picking up some caches. I last visited Lost River in the early 1990s and I have wanted to return for a while. I didn't have time for the cave tour today, but spent my time walking the trails. After registering at the office, I spend an hour or so exploring this really nice park. It was a little muddy from rains the previous day, but I had my hiking boots so that didn't matter. I plan to come back with my wife in the near future so she can enjoy this too! I love ECs, and cave ECs even more so as you can tell from my name. So I was definitely going to get this one. I made my observations, took pictures and gathered my data for the EC during my visit to the park. For now I am recording the visit on this day, and after I write up my answers I will send them and log a find. Maybe thanks for this fantastic EC at a place that has so much to see and learn! This one's getting a fav point!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2E3FB_lost-river-cave-and-valley-earthcache

Ground Fox	Found it	9/3/2018	We are in the area finding ECs this long weekend and this was one of our stops along the way. We really enjoyed this one. They were very kind to us when we told them that we were geocachers and let us go ahead of the tour group. The trails were nicely groomed and the caches along the way were fabulous. Also enjoyed the nice gift shop here. Answers headed your way along with this favorite point. TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2E3FB_lost-river-cave-and-valley-earthcache
GR8CACHERS	Found it	6/30/2018	Visited the area with Sir Cache-alot. It was a hot humid day reaching into the high 90's. The last time we visited we were non caches. We took the boat tour then. Not enough time for that today unfortunately. Appreciate the caches and a reason to return. We were through here about a year ago and noticed the earth cache. We had been wanting to return because of the EC. So glad we did. This is an interesting and beautiful area. One of these days I'm going to try that zip line thing. Anyway we checked into the office and headed out. There were lots of people most likely because of the holiday weekend. Looks like someone is getting married soon as well. We made the trek to the end of the trail to see the beginning of the river. We are so glad we made it. Answers have been submitted for us and Sir Cache-alot. Thank you for supporting geocaching.

Clifton	Found it	3/10/2018	With some time but not much time on my hands, while being in Bowling Green for an afternoon, I decided to have a look only for earth caches and virtuals. So, I filtered the (boring?) traditionals out, and found a nice master plan. The earth cache seems to be a nice walk, and I started out on that. Problem one: where it that visitor center. After having driven all around (as far as I could see) without such a center becoming apparent, I just put the car on a parking spot in the vicinity of the first waypoint and started walking. There were plenty other people around here, and I wasn't afraid of getting lost here or something. At the first waypoint I gathered the required info, and moved on. Then to the butterfly greenhouse: barren, cold and no butterfly in there anymore. From here on into the valley along the several geological stone and water formations, every now and then writing down another answer for the CO. At the end, a tumultuous water drop (where did ALL this water come from so suddenly) into a void forms a nice closure to this geocache. All the answers have been sent to the CO, and I had a long walk (mistakenly I took to the road (and the verge), but that is apparently not what you should do in the USA). #3212, earth cache #170, now that I'm writing this log I notice that I had forgotten to turn the traditionals on again on my smart phone app. Darn it: I've missed some nine pick-my-up traditionals while walking this park valley!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2E3FB_lost-river-cave-and-valley-earthcache

I will have to admit, that having completed a Mammoth Cave tour earlier in the morning and part of the Caching in the Cave series I was pretty tired by the time I finished the stages for this EC. But it was well worth the effort. Many thanks to the 6Lindseys for creating this EC. It gets a favorite point from me. I will e-mail my answers shortly.

Tattoo Tom	Found it	3/23/2016	I've hiked this trail a couple dozen times at least. Abe the Geodog and I decided to revisit it today since it's perfect hiking/geocaching weather. I was pretty sure I knew where each location was without having to plug in the coordinates, but did anyways to double check. It took us a little while to get to each stage because Abe was in a sniffing mood today. Luckily we didn't see any squirrels or I don't think we would have ever been able to leave.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2E3FB_lost-river-cave-and-valley-earthcache

Message sent to the CO Freakycat and I are on holidays from Ireland. Today we visited Bowling Green from Gallatin TN, the first time we have been in Kentucky. We copied our photos, and log file onto the laptop that evening but when we went to log them the following morning it was as dead as a doornail and all attempts to resuscitate it have failed.

Jaty5	Found it	2/7/2015	With my mom and dad (AstroD) on our yearly trek to the Florida Keys. I think we did this one in the reverse order as we started at the cave first and worked our way to the far end of the park. This was cool park to explore despite the muddy trails. We sat and debated a few of the questions, but eventually came to a consensus on the answers. Thanks for showcasing this cool park. Definitely worth the stop - caches or not. Hope to com back here next year. Mom sent in the answers. Thanks!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2E3FB_lost-river-cave-and-valley-earthcache
Astro_D	Found it	2/7/2015	Spent the night in Bowling Green after a long drive from the Frozen Tundra. Our son wanted to visit the Corvette Museum this morning. Afterwards, I told the family about this cool park and cave that might be worth seeing. So after the museum, we drove over here to check it out. We were not disappointed! This is a cool park!! I quickly wrote down what info we needed to investigate to do this Earthcache and off we were to explore the park via the numerous and muddy trails. Besides learning a bit of the history of the place, we got some geology lessons and, we were able to see and photo two life birds as well!! Thanks for the Earthcache. It was well done - especially in highlighting many of the best geological features this park has to offer. We have added this park to our list of birding spots as well. Hopefully, when we get by this way again, we'll be able to stop and see what other birds we'll be able to spot. Thanks!

AR RStanton	Found it	10/2/2014	My wife and I took off for a few days to head over to the Mammoth Cave area for a few days. We cached both ways and while we were there. I managed to pick up 11 virtuals, 7 Earthcaches, my first and only webcam, a D5 puzzle and many other caches at interesting spots in 4 different states, including 2 that I had not cached in before. We enjoyed seeing all the places that we went, and appreciate all the COs that placed these caches, we had a great trip and geocaching was a big part of that. Thanks again to everyone, I have lots of fav points to give out.

KanoeBillder	Didn't find it	5/23/2019	When I arrived at GZ, I first focused on the hint area. Without dismantling the wall as instructed I poked and prodded and lifted and replaced but could find nothing in the way of a container there. Next I tossed the hint and focused on the coordinates a short distance away. I lifted and rolled a lot of rocks in an area I certainly would not consider a wall and still found nothing. I tried walking along both the upper and lower trails to see if something container like was visible, but nothing jumped out at me. If it is still there, it is well hidden.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC37348_the-hibernia-mine-underground-railway
JKolpa	Found it	5/4/2019	Hmmm... I think there is a fine line between what is a wall and what is a collection of stones. Lots in this area could be considered any of the above.

stellarscapes	Found it	4/3/2019	Geocaching today with Eyeball&Chain. This cache was one of 43 finds today on this nice warm Spring day. I traded shifts with someone at work today so I could get the entire day off to go geocaching. We headed to Franklin, New Jersey, then down Route 23, then cached southward along Berkshire Valley Road to the Wharton area where we found a few caches. We then headed to the Rockaway area, then north up Green Pond Road and back to Route 23 North to our meeting spot. We spotted this one as we approached, it was easily visible from the trail. Signed the log and replaced the cache, concealing it a little better than we found it. We then continued up the trail to the mine opening. We felt the cold air coming out of the mine as we approached. Took a bunch of pictures, then headed back to the parking lot. TNLNSL.

First, "wow" it is really cool (both in the temperature sense and the interesting and unusual sense). Second, "wow" that is a lot of hornets nesting in there and buzzing around and maybe we should have brought the epi-pen. We also enjoyed learning the history of this one, and how it differs from the other mines in the area.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1XQRB_gold-hill-anatomy-of-a-gold-mine

drharrison	Found it	3/5/2018	As Crescent Trekkers and gbmcache have already stated, we did a few Earth Caches today. Since they both appended our photo, I will forego adding yet another copy of the same photo. We spent quite a while here examining the rocks and discussing them. Will send answers to questions via email.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1XQRB_gold-hill-anatomy-of-a-gold-mine
gbmcache	Found it	3/5/2018	I had hoped that we might actually go deep into a mine, but such was not the case. Crescent Trekkers, drharrison, and I spent a good bit of time discussing the rocks and the answers. In that none of us are geologists even the interpretation of the cache description is a reach. Would that we had Michael Jordan with us.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1XQRB_gold-hill-anatomy-of-a-gold-mine
Crescent Trekkers	Found it	3/5/2018	I joined drharrison and gbmcache for a pleasant day of caching in the area.

GeoCrater	Temporarily Disable Listing	11/19/2019	Good Day, This geocache was brought to my attention as being in need of an owner maintenance visit. The cache owner needs to check on this cache ASAP and either replace it or archive it, after picking up any geo-litter. See the maintenance section of the Geocache Listing Requirements/Guidelines. I've added this cache to my watchlist, and I will check back in four weeks to be sure that the maintenance has been done. In the meantime, I have temporarily disabled this listing.

Whatever your intentions, please post a note here on the cache page (not email) to let us know that you are still active and maintaining the cache. If a month passes without seeing a response, then I'll assume that this listing should be archived.

yogacrone	Found it	8/23/2016	I wanted to do some hiking and get some smileys. Saw this trail system on the map and it seemed perfect. Turned out, it is. Loved hiking here! I logged 4.1 miles, but it felt like a lot more. I had optimistically expected to romp through all the caches here and still have time for the Wherigo and maybe a few other Bennington caches. Ha, Ha! I actually have to come back and finish the 4 I didn't have time - or, energy, for. All the hides I looked for I found, and mostly all in great shape. I parked at the Athletic building and walked up hill past the fields. Went in the direction of the closest cache and kept going to this one. Took me quite a bit of searching before I decided that "near" can be interpreted in different ways. Got to an alternate perspective and saw a likely hiding spot. Yup! Cache is in fine shape. Thanks to those who have kept it going. I enjoyed the climb and the little bit of the cave I was brave enough to explore. TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1CFX7_svc-cave

Followed the uphill trail to get to GZ, but had to expand our search quite a bit after reading some previous logs... and C5Z made the find in a well-hidden location near the cave entrance !

Pen4	Found it	5/14/2016	I found the trail off of Sandy Point Rd. no problem with a good pull off spot to park the car. The trail is well marked and it was called Rockpile trail. As soon as I got to the cave I met up with two runners and we wish each other well. I forgot to bring a garbage bag to pick up the litter but I will the next time I am in. There is no way I was going into that cave, I will enjoy it from up on the path. Cache was found, thanks to the good hint. While here, music started playing from the Old Peacock property. This put me in a happy mood as I skipped and hopped my way to the next cache. Thank you for adding fun to my day and if I had realized that this cache was so accessible, I would have been here sooner.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC7FE1_happy-spelunking-at-howes-cave

A hard search for the cache and we came up with nothing. A PAF convinced us the cache might be gone so we went down the trail. We found a suitable container though that we later brought back and replaced the missingone. I hope that is ok. Thank you chuckswaggin, a favorite point for this location!

wanderfish	Found it	4/30/2018	On our last full (non-travel) day in the area we decided to try to clear out the rest of the geocaches we had left in this park. The last time we were here ....we kind of found ourselves with our pants caught around our ankles and weren't really prepared for the kind of strenuous hiking a jab at most of these caches might cost us. Though we had our hiking sticks and proper footwear, we had only brought a couple of water bottles. We didn't realize after finding a different cache that the famous 'Soldier Cave' cache was so close by. When we were last here we made a go for it and sadly, it was M.I.A. Today we avenged our previous DNF and finally we were able to log this notorious cache. I wish I could tell you We cleaned up all the rest of caches in the park. We got all but one.... the very last one on our way out of the park. We had to DNF, 'Tipped Over.' It made our stomach's turn to walk away without a smile face here but we spent a good 40 minutes on the hunt and came up empty handed. We know when its time to cry uncle.... Maybe next time? This was our first find of the day and our 5848th find overall. Thank you for adding to our 'Ernie-versary' weekend memories.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

I put both in a new 35 mm film canister I had with me, then rehid it among the roots. I went inside the cave to warmup, it felt much warmer in there, since the outside temp was about 16 degrees this morning. I came down the trail that runs by "Tipped Over" instead of the stairs, but I went backup using the stairs, a real good workout! tftc 1Mech	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Ms Sunshine	Found it	11/14/2017	I was here on a bus trip with the seniors, and this was the only day I could sneak away to do some hiking. I had been to this park 4 years ago and loved it, so even though it was a little damp, I ubered over. My goal was to avenge my DNF from years ago. I took the "short" way down, though my boots were soon caked in mud, so I doubt it was quicker. (I did take the stairway back up!) I thought this was going to be another DNF, when finally I found it. I wrestled with it for a good 5 minutes before was finally able to retrieve it and sign the log! I really enjoyed coming back to this area, and am happy to cross this one off mt list. Thanks!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	10/10/2017	STATUS UPDATE NEEDED OR POSSIBLY OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last few logs on this cache it appears that this cache may be in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... CACHE MAINTENANCE "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the ”NEEDS MAINTENANCE” attribute is showing you will need to do the following. CACHES THAT NEED MAINTENANCE Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and may be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I will be looking forward to hearing back from you soon. In the meantime your cache has been disabled.

wanderfish	Didn't find it	9/16/2017	We were camping at Cape Fair C.O.E. campground for the weekend for an RV show in Springfield on Sunday. The weather forecast for Saturday was clear and sunny and rainy for Sunday so we flipped flopped our plans and decided to use this day for geocaching. Boy are we glad we did. We had a wonderful time geocaching, flying by the seat of our pants - picking which cache to go to next as we went along, rather than having a planned out map of the day like we usually do. Val is finally starting to settle in and enjoy the journey as much as the destination.... must be the old age thing ;) The Sunday RV show turned out to be a huge disappointment. We left the show after only an hour then decided to take in a movie after that since it was raining. The movie was just as floppy as the RV show. So glad we paid attention to the weather and made the most of the one good weather day we had to save our long weekend mini-vacation. Originally we weren't planning on going for this cache. We had come to the area searching for an easier cache when Matt pulled up several others that were in the same park. Imagine our surprise when we discovered the legendary Soldier's Cave was one of them. We have known about this cache for years, and never felt prepared enough for it, physically anyway. We aren't in the best shape we have been in but we are in good enough shape we decided to go for it today. We discovered we are in better shape than we thought, but still want to be in better shape lol. It probably wasn't the smartest idea to go for this one with only a couple of water bottles between the two of us but we made it anyway ;) We were super disappointed to not find the cache here. As always it doesn't necessarily mean the cache isn't there. We have been bested by many a 1/1 - so we could have just been off. Sometimes you just can't see what is there. At any rate, after a seriously extensive search - we came up empty handed as many other previous cachers have as well. At least we can say we've been there and we will be back someday as we loved our camping spot in Cape Fair, and we left more than one cache un-found in the area that we want to come back for someday. We are putting this one on the watch list to see what happens... (and hopefully save our pride - to find it really was missing)... It is worth noting a very large pile of critter poo was at the base of said tree where gz was - we've had more than one cache get swiped by a critter or two.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

djustice	Found it	1/28/2017	What a trip! We took the wrong trail to get here. Missed the steps altogether on the way down but don't worry we took them back up. :-( The views we saw were awesome! However, we did quite a bit of back and forth trying to figure out how to get down where we knew we needed to be. Which is why you should take the right path. (sigh) Met a sweet young couple newly married and new to the area. Decided they needed to know about geocaching and introduced them to the sport!

Rathergohiking	Found it	11/24/2016	We are in Branson for Thanksgiving. My wife and son from The Woodlands Texas, my Mon from Tulsa, and my daughter from Traverse City, Michigan. We had Cracker Barrel cater our Thanksgiving meal, which was surprisingly good. While everyone was lounging around stuffed and putting on extra pounds, my daughter and I decided to take a hike and go geocaching in an effort to mitigate the gazillion calories we had just inhaled. We sure were glad we did! This is a great nature area. We found six of the seven caches we went after and had a great time doing it. The "steps" were easy on the way down but a lot more difficult on the way up! Thanks for placing this cache. Very well deserving of a faforite point!!

kiecker	Found it	7/3/2016	We rolled in town on Friday tonight for a couple days of exploring a new town for us. Not quite sure what all we'll do but I'm sure we'll find some adventure, sites, and oddities. Today was our last day in Branson and there were still a section of caches that I wanted to attempt before heading back. I had been keeping an eye on the weather as it looked like there was only a small window of dry opportunity early in the morning before the rain was set to arrive. With that being said, Kai and I started our day with the sunrise to attempt all the caches at Lakeside Forest Wilderness Area. This area is ripe with juicy DTs, 3 ECs, and what appears to be an excellent trail system. We were both excited. We started with heading down the stairs and heading north, then back tracked and made a loop of the area. We picked up our pace a bit as we knew it was only time until the sky let completely loose and we'd be soaked. I hadn't read this cache prior to arriving so when I got there I had a different idea of where I was going to have to go to obtain. Luckily I didn't have to on this wet host. Thanks for placing!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

The Blue Heron	Found it	2/18/2016	Mrs. Heron had a training class in Branson for the next two days, so the rest of the Herons decided to do some geocaching. The classes were perfectly timed with beautiful weather. We hit the Lakeside Forest Trails first. I love hiking and this trail system had more than a few caches we could find in a short amount of time. Wow there are caves on this trail too!?! Such a cool place! The morning sun was enough to light our way. Once inside, we were sad to see graffiti on the walls. It seems nowhere is safe from the selfish hands of hooligans. It was still a sight to see. Thanks for bringing us here!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
JoyfulNomad	Found it	2/1/2016	We are visiting from North California and today we wanted to go for a hike to pick some highly favored caches along the Lakeside Forest Trails by the lake. For two relatively old cachers we did pretty well. Walked about 5 miles and down and up those 338 steps! We ran into two muggles also enjoying the trail. They took to geocaching very quickly and we believe they will continue on when they return home to Springfield. The weather was absolutely wonderful. We had a great time!

flowerchild60	Found it	11/7/2015	This was such a great weekend. I brought my Mother to Branson this weekend to meet up with my brother and sister-n-law to celebrate our Mother's 90th birthday. I had mentioned this cache and that one day I wanted to get the smiley. After I read the description to the family my brother said that he would like to go see this area. So after breakfast on Saturday we headed off for the adventure. Now neither one of us is in the best of shape but we had the confidence to get this done. The morning was a little cool so we had our jackets on. That didn't last long. After going down several sections of stairs we came to a landing that had a nice flat rock to the side. That is where we left our jackets for the rest of the trip down. We decided if they were gone oh well. On and on we went. The day was gorgeous!!! We reached a point where he saw one of the caves and he made the comment he wished he had a flashlight, he didn't so we continued on. After a while I got my phone out and realized we had gone past GZ. I commented that it would be really funny if the cave he looked at was GZ. We turned around and started the trek back. Yep, the cave he had looked at was GZ!!! And to make the adventure even better he was the one that spotted the cache. The morning was just wonderful!!! (And our jackets were still there). We passed a young lady that told us she walks those steps 3 time a day and sometimes 6 days a week! I'm just glad I made it down those steps and back up one time. Thanks so much for the adventure! Oh, and we did explore the cave which is my kind of cave.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

MMaru	Found it	9/13/2015	Whoo-whee! This cache has been on my radar for a long time. When I moved to Springfield a little over a year ago, I started asking cachers at events what some of their favorite caches were - this is one that kept coming up over and over! I was warned several times that it was one was not a cache to be taken lightly - don't do it right after it rains, it's not one recommended for someone who is overweight or out of shape, etc. Well, as I am a pretty heavy girl, I'd initially told myself that when I lose 50lbs, going for this cache would be my personal reward. Well... I still have those pounds, but I was in the area for the first time in a while. I was really hoping to make this one find #500 by collecting other caches along the way, but as I got to the park, I knew I'd have time to EITHER get to 500 finds, OR find this cache - I chose the latter! Getting though the grotto was really an incredible experience. There was no water, so I liked seeing the picture of the waterfall that is there when there's been heavy rains. I get why I was warned not to do this cache if I was out of shape - as soon as I started down those steps, I knew I'd hate myself in a little while. But I really wanted to collect this smiley, so I persevered! When I got to the cave, I'd misread the clue and thought that it said that the cache was right -inside- the cave. I set down my geobag and unzipped it to retrieve my flashlight... only to find that I had apparently never returned it to my bag after my one and only night caching excursion! ARGH! Knowing I was NOT going to climb back up and down those steps to get it from my car, nor was I going to just shrug it off and pass on this find, I grabbed my camera and proceeded to use the flash to search every crevice and bump in this cave! I probably spent a good half hour doing this, at least, and told myself half a dozen times that I was just going to have to give up and come back. On a hunch, I checked outside the cave, and voila! Nice, easy find which, as usual, I made much harder than it needed to be! But no regrets - I would have had a blast exploring this cave even without me mixing up the hint! I even made two little froggie friends in there. :) As I predicted, I sort of hated myself when it came time to go back up those steps - I've had knee problems since I was a kid and I knew it would kill my knees. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I did not plead for death rather than climb another step - extra bonus of this cache was realizing that even though I haven't been dropping any pants sizes, geocaching adventures like this have really been helping to improve my health and fitness! So happy I had the opportunity to go after this one! I can definitely tell why so many people recommended it! TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
Wanderlustatitsbest	Found it	9/13/2015	We stayed outside of Springfield then explored Branson a little before driving on to Tennessee today.

chuck80196	Found it	8/15/2015	This trail has been on my radar for a while now. Today I decided to take a hike and do some caching. I took the bluff trail so I missed the walk down the steps. There was only about 30 left to walk down when I finally arrived at the stairway. Very cool cave! Went inside and took a couple pics. Enjoyed the cache and the hike! Thanks for the adventure! L2$AD!

Specter	Found it	7/25/2015	This cache has been on my to do list ever since it came out and today I made it happen. After finding Tipped over and bypassing the steps and I almost wished I had back tracked and took the steps it was awful slippy after the rain from the night before. Hiking down to the top of the waterfall and seeing how large it was made the hike all the more worth while. I was able to search and find the cache without any problems. The cave floor was covered with water I didn't spend very long inside. Thanks for placing this cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
kimbotjr	Found it	7/24/2015	Returned to the Springfield and Branson areas for a couple of days of catching up with family, some relaxation, and of course working in a few cache visits. The caching was primarily focused on some higher D/Ts, some puzzles we had solved here and there, and a few others that were of interest. Hit the Lakeside Wilderness trails early in the morning, amid some fog and oodles of spider webs. The Soldier Cave cache was actually a return visit from earlier in the year, when we came away with a DNF. We fortunately came away with a find today, but it wasn't easy locating the well-hidden container. Great area, and great location for a cache. Thanks for the hide.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Been raining a lot and when it wasn't raining, I've been biking a lot. (not a bike friendly sort of trail here). Sorry for any perspiration that may have tainted the log. I did find it and sign.

Nawwal_AC	Found it	5/23/2015	This was such a fun park to explore today. Had a great time walking the trails and taking in the views. I was a little nervous about possibly waking up some bats in the cave but there weren’t any to be found. I was pleasantly surprised by the little cave salamanders though. They were pretty cool. It’s amazing how much cooler it is in the cave versus only a few feet outside. Interesting history to this place. TFTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

kimbotjr	Didn't find it	3/17/2015	Took advantage of today's nice weather to visit a few caches in Missouri. The total finds at the end of day wasn't high, but the quality of caches was good and many of the locations provided some added interest and/or fun to our searches. The Lakeside Wilderness was our last place to cache today and is a great location. Unfortunately, looks like our timing wasn't good for this one. As we start to enter this log, we see that the cache recently went missing...which makes sense since our thorough search came up empty. We did enjoy visiting Soldier Cave.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

arkfiremedic	Found it	12/6/2014	A little leery heading down here alone to do such a high difficulty/terrain cache by myself, but hey we do what we got to do sometimes ;) My wife and daughter dropped me off this morning in the park and I told them to give me about three hours by myself so they could go spend my Christmas bonus in Branson (the main reason for the trip). Not wanting to sit in store parking lots for the majority of the day I decided to come to this park just off the strip to kill some time and shed some calories from all the eating we have been doing while in town. This was my third find in the park of many. It actually rained all day yesterday and the leaves were wet, but I took my time and was cautious on my decent down to the great cache here. The story behind this cache is some very interesting information to me. Thank you chuckswaggin for the fun I had today in the park. Of course I'll award this one with its 110th favorite point for sure! TFTC! AFM	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

We made the initial search and toured around inside the cave for a little. Returned to the search and about the time ORR made the find some muggles were coming up the trail. Had a few kind words and we SL and replaced. Thanks for another great hide in a great area chuckswaggin!!!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
Old River Runner	Found it	11/6/2014	This one had woodduck and me going for a while, climbing all over the place. I finally stuck my hand in a place where he did not want to, and there was the cache!

NeverSeenGene	Found it	11/2/2014	I will add details and one or more photos when I get back home late next week, if not earlier. Thanks! [Okay, I am back home now. As for this cache, I was in Branson--up from my home in the North Carolina mountains--to see my grandkids who were down from Whiteman Air Force Base. Very early Sunday morning I got a little extra time to do some caching in the great Lakeside Forest Wilderness park and picked off this one--along with seven others on the lower trail(s) before rushing back for breakfast and church and then to meet everyone out at Silver Dollar City when it opened that afternoon. This one was a great hide in a great area in a very nice park. I enjoyed the walk and the search, as well as the find. Thanks for a great all-around geocache!] This entry was edited by NeverSeenGene on Saturday, 08 November 2014 at 00:00:20 UTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

OrigamiFolder	Found it	9/19/2014	I was a little surprised to see muggles when I arrived as I thought I was cutting it close to get out of the park before close. Maybe that sundown thing is flexible? Well I've been meaning to come down here every time I come to Branson but the muggles or the weather always won out. Well today with some helpful insistence from DougHolly_NKC back home I dropped the muggles off at the water park and with surprising ease made my way around the park. I'd like to say I Running Jayhawked it but I don't really have that much speed and agility (it was my version of it anyway). Well the exploration of the cave was brief but enjoyable, I'll need to return with more time. Thanks!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Today was our most beautiful day of the trip. The rain let up and the sun came out. It made our hike along this trail wonderful. When it's this beautiful, it's my favorite time of the year. We had a bit of trouble locating the cache here, but eagle eyed louinliberty found it using a flashlight in the exact same spot we all tried to look in earlier. Wahoo! Favorite point!

After the last two days of rain/cold weather we were happy to see the sun. Soldier Cave was the first cache on our agenda this morning. The journey to the cave sight and cache did not disappoint. The fall colors and the view were awesome. Absolutely no breeze and we could hear church bells in the valley. What really made this special was sharing it great friends. Of course, this will get a favorite. Thanks, Carlin, Liberty, Mo.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

lbkmmkmm	Found it	10/25/2013	Nice hike and an interesting spot. Was not an easy find once we got there. My gps battery died and so I had to use my cell phone to zero in on it. Also had to use my cell phone flashlight to explore all the cracks and crannies. It was a nice fall day - cool which made going back up the stairs nicer.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
fd SCorpion	Found it	10/21/2013	We were in town to take care of some family business and had to make the trek to get this one. I left my brother at the top of the trail because it appeared that the hike was going to be as advertised, and it didn't disappoint. The views of the rock formations and the water below were spectacular. I finally got to the area and my gps kept directing me down below and I spent a few minutes sliding around there. I got back up and looked at the hint and a few of the previous logs and decided to refocus my search. There it was, hidden quite nicely. I signed the log and placed the cache back and peered into the cave. It was really dark in there at 5 in the afternoon on a cloudy day, and I decided against going in. What a great place for a cache and amazing story. Thanks for the hide.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
eXuhdUS	Found it	10/20/2013	Went looking for this one while on a tip from a longtime local about some great walking/hiking trails located right in the middle of Branson.

What better way than to get some geocaches in. We were a total fail at the previous site which was disheartening since we met CO on the way there and he said it was in good shape.

TripCyclone	Found it	7/22/2013	Table Rock is a yearly vacation for my wife's family, one I started joining two years ago. Last year, Doug_hollyNKC happened to mention how much he liked this cache when he heard I was going to be in the area. I never made it over to the cache last year...and I am happy for that. This year, we traveled down for vacation with me sitting at 3,997 caches. I needed something for my 4,000th cache. I had my options narrowed down to only a few caches. This was one of them. It was a cache I probably would not have looked at if Doug had not mentioned it as we usually do not get over to Branson during the week we are here. Well, the other two options had a slight problem. One requires SCUBA diving and while my wife is certified, I am not, and we did not have all of the necessary gear and did not want to rent it all for a single cache. The other would have required considerably more drive time even though it is closer to where we are staying due to the need to approach from the opposite side of the lake. That left Soldier's Cave, one Doug spoke highly of and had me intrigued. My wife and I both like hiking, so a choice was made. I still needed two more caches. I intended to get them in the park but a wrong turn trying to find the parking area and I ended up getting the nearby virtual for #3998. Once parked, we went through the construction (so nice that they made a path for hikers to do this) and I signed Tipped Over! for #3999 (can't believe I overlooked it but my wife made the find). I passed a few others to get to Soldier's Cave. I had to use my phone to do this. My Oregon is in Nebraska having left it with a friend last week by accident. My eTrex was not working due to dead batteries. This meant that signal was not great along parts of the trail. The hike down the rocks was pretty cool. I was quite impressed by how it had the impression of being positioned more ornately, with winding, curving stairways. We saw a few lizards along the way too. Once done with the stairs, the waterfall area was nice. We saw a picture of what it looks like when it is flowing and that would have been fun to see. The trail was not as easy to follow there but we found the spot and climbed the rocks to continue. Eventually, we found a large cave. It seemed like a good spot but my phone said I was still 120 feet away. My wife stayed behind as I went forward. The phone was not changing and it got further away. I turned back and once at the cave entrance, I joined her in the search. After a few minutes, I happened to get at the right angle, well the right angle to see the cache but not for comfort. I signed the log and then my wife took some photos. After signing, we explored the cave. A pretty neat cave. It seems roomy for a single person, but it would have been cold in the winter. I took some pictures inside the cave as well before we took some more outside. Then we began the hike back. We both were a bit tired from the stairs but we also both enjoyed the hike. Thank you for placing this one here. I will add a favorite point, not just because this is officially my 4,000th find, but because we both had a lot of fun. And a thanks to Doug for recommending this one too me.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
hallsks	Found it	7/18/2013	We made the walk...stairs and all. From this area you do not want to fall. We signed the blank log and put it back.... after a rodent climbed up my arm.... needless to say I dropped my phone. We had a good laugh as I put the phone back together.

OkiePaladin	Didn't find it	7/15/2013	We decided to take a nice hike this morning before leaving Branson for our trip home. We had been down this trail once before several years ago, but were excited about getting back and exploring the new caches here. We really wanted to get to this cache as I saw it after it was first published and the logs looked intriguing. On our last several trips to Branson we just couldn't get the hike into our schedule with family groups, ice storms, etc. So today was the day, we thought. Unfortunately we have to post a DNF like the last log. Found everything as described and even gave the cave a good search to see if it had been "misplaced", but came up empty. Glad we could carry on and get a find on the exciting "Panther's View" down the trail.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Without your efforts the sport would be less than it is.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
Team AZMO	Found it	5/4/2013	We headed to Branson for a three day weekend. We are meeting up with some of Dane’s friends from when he was stationed in Korea. They haven’t seen each other since they left Korea all those years ago. Day Two - in and around Branson: Out caching with Don't Call Me Sir, KevinP_JF, Lakeshore Cacher, thetruth7, tx Packrat and Mrs. tx Packrat. After the Flash Mob we set out to find this one. It was truly a destination cache for this trip. KevnP_JF, thetruth7, Ms tx Packrat and Don't Call Me Sir served together in Korea and it is only fitting that they find Soldier Cave together. So, the hike began. Down, down, down the steps we went. (That is a LOT of steps!) The trail to the cache site was wet and a bit slick but a slow steady pace made it a go for everyone involved. (8 adults and 3 kids in all.) The cache itself was pretty easy to find. The real "treasure" for us was the experience. As was said among our group several times - it was "epic". The soldiers took a pic in the cave and explored a bit. We all took in the scenery and the beautiful view of the river. We headed on down the trail to grab another cache and then it was back UP. We stopped at the waterfall and some of the group played around a bit. Then we began the climb back up ALL those steps. I know we will all feel this in the morning (or soon thereafter) but it was totally worth it. [Purple][b]Team AZMO would like to thank you for all your hard work. We really appreciate you adding to our caching fun. [/b][/Purple] This entry was edited by Team AZMO on Wednesday, 20 May 2015 at 22:32:40 UTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

ThatGrif	Found it	2/18/2013	So this was our fourth cache on our, 950 mile 21 hour georoad trip for Missouri Top ten. Well after reading this cache page description and looking at the pics we had to go for it. So we get to the parking and look at the trail map and the stairs pop out 700 plus stairs to deal with. Off we went such a nice walk through the woods then the stairs came, and came, and came. We arrived at the bottom only to find much more trail to go. Arriving at the cave site I was in the lead so Kevin and Tiffany had to come find me. It is hard to imagine living in this cave for so long its a long way anywhere and im sure his trail was no where near as nice as our walk in. This was a great example of why I love geocaching you find places you would never see or know of EVER. Thanks for sharing this spot with us the excerise was just plan fun for this cache. Favorite for sure. This entry was edited by sgriffin618 on Tuesday, 19 February 2013 at 16:34:54 UTC.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

We really enjoy the hunt for a well placed cache… we might not find each one because we really are not that good but we still enjoy looking. We very much appreciate your work in making and setting this up. This was a well earned smiley…. We only had a window of about 3 hrs to cache today so I picked put the hardest ones in the area to try and attempt to find.

Team AZMO	Write note	2/13/2013	We are looking at this cache for May and I'm wondering where the parking is?

JoLynn64	Found it	1/11/2013	My daughter and I got off work early today and decided to take her dog and do a little hiking and caching on this unseasonably warm January day. We met LOTS of hikers on the trail today and all had lots of information to share. We arrived at GZ and found the cache very quickly. It was a beautiful hike here to the cache......the hike back though was a little less pleasant! TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

the-snowlight	Found it	12/29/2012	Out to find a few more caches for our 2012 stats. This one was a well-deserved smiley. . Out with grandpa on nice sunny, but cold winter day. We visited the are to escape the winter-ice storm in Little Rock AR. While caching in here we did not know that we would be without power for six days. So we came, saw, searched and found many smileys while staying in great lake resort nearby. . The stair were no problem coming. Great way to access the trail and caches down her. Unfortunately, we had to go them back up. I am sure glad we did not came in the summer heat. We even worked up a sweat in the cold winter weather. . Thank you for brining us out here. Who would have though such a trail in mist of town. TFTAwesome cache.

Wampuscat_mo	Found it	11/24/2012	I don't know about hiding from Yankees for a couple of years but I will say this- the soldier cave made my short list of places to ride out a class four zombie outbreak. No way is Zack making it all the way down those stairs! Cache is still present and in fine shape. GPS had it off by 25+ feet off but on this type of location that's probably common. Careful in the cave as there's a little feller hanging on the ceiling. If he's done for the year he'll get stressed if people mess around in there too much and not make it through the winter. Thanks for the cache and bringing us to an amazing place.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
Smiley Guy	Found it	11/23/2012	Found on a holiday visit to Branson. The weather was right for a hike. Plenty of muggles on the trail. We enjoyed seeing a lonely bat on the ceiling of the cave.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Alysse	Found it	11/13/2012	I finally had a day off of work and decided that I wasn't going to waste it inside since I knew that these days were going to grow far and few between. I had heard a lot about this area and decided to head out and see what it was all about. When they warn you that you must be in shape to do this trail, they aren't kidding. I made down the 338 stairs just fine and over to the cave. Made quick work of finding the cache. Made my way back across the grotto. I then stopped to catch my breathe to make it back up the hill. The 338 steps back up were nothing like going down them. I was quite the workout but I made it back up the hill. Thanks for placing the cache in a great area.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

go-purdue	Found it	10/25/2012	Sweet victory at 9:10pm! We are on vacation in Branson, and this was our last night in town. Our daughter got a text from a neighbor girl in our town that she too was in Branson, and they MUST must must meet up! So, we drove our daughter to her friend's hotel and decided to go after this cache in the two hours that we had to kill. I was a little worried about just how difficult it might be do to in the dark, with the rain from today making the steps slick, and the wet leaves adding to the slippery-ness, but my husband said we should go for it anyway. :) So, off we went. He didn't use a light at all, but I constantly burned my flashlight app on my phone along the way, so I would have any falls. We LOVED this cache. Thanks for bringing us here! He enjoyed the cave and talked about the books he read when he was younger. My friend Tallulahtulip told me about this cache over a year ago and said we should go for it, so glad that we did! We tried to take some pictures, but they didn't come out that great. We stayed here for a while, listening to the sounds of bats over the river, then made our ascent where we DNF'd a cache that we probably shouldn't have. We didn't have a lot of time to keep looking, so we had to give up on that one. Thanks for the memories!

MrsSubman	Found it	10/11/2012	The last day for caching in Banson. Grabbed a few I missed on the roads and then went hiking. Thanks for the cache The wife was concerned that I would not get back in time for the show. I said I be back in about 30 minutes. So, I made a mad dash down the step only stopping to get by a unleashed dog on the rock seat with it owner. I met a woman on the way back up and she said her mother and my wife were talking up above. So, I got back with plenty time to spare and enjoyed the show later. a favorite from me......	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave
GiveaMark	Found it	10/9/2012	Our first time to Branson and with so many things to do, this cache was the only one we went after. We both are interested in the local stories and this was quite the adventure. We also found a few of the other smaller caves in the area. Many people taking the steps challenge. We passed old, young and out of breath, perspiring people. Wonderful combination of adventure and exercise. TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

davisar100	Found it	10/1/2012	Found it while visiting my Grandmother in Rockaway beach all the way from AZ. Boy did we underestimate the terrain rating! We're used to climbing 500 - 1000 ft to grab caches in the mountains all over AZ. What we didn't factor in was the humidity and the overlooked fact that we had to park our 14 month old son's stroller at the stairs and hike all 730 odd stairs with him in our arms or on our shoulders. Didn't bring the kiddo backpack to have him ride in! All in all it was a great little hike. Made it down and back in about 30 minutes to ensure we met up with my parents for more Branson sightseeing. Took some time to explore the cave and take some pictures. Thanks for a great natural adventure in the land of lights and corny shows! Yet again an opportunity to visit a place we never would have found if it wasn't for Geocaching.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Trekkie79	Found it	9/11/2012	Enjoyed a wonderful day hiking trails all around the Branson area. Started the the day off with a nice 3 mile hike around the nature center. In a word Awesome. Had to resort to the cache outside the cave as couldn't find the version inside. Was a wonderful hike to the cache other than the 338 steps down and then back up, and that part of the trail was under fallen tree and rockslide. Otherwise loved the experience.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2G058_soldier-cave

Only ventured about 100 feet in or so, the mine seems to have a very healthy spider population (those buggers were huge!). Fascinating find! Sent the pic and answers to the cache owner.

gnome#4	Found it	5/18/2018	Day 22 I am out here on a two month Eastern Canada trip. I started off from Toronto and slowly made my way to the Maritimes. I caught the boat to Newfoundland. Cabot Trail and then PEI. My Dad flew into Montreal in mid June. My son into Hamilton a week later. From there, us three generations did a roadtrip back to BC, visiting family all along the way. I planned my entire trip by mapping out a route following earthcaches, virtuals and webcams. In two months, I visited about 400 of them. Currently, I have found nine of the ten provinces oldest or active caches. I only need to find Saskatchewan. I also have seven capital cities in the Great White North Geotour and hope to have all ten by the end of the summer. This has been an awesome trip and thanks to all the CO's who have created and maintained all the caches I have found and visited. After a maintenance appoinment for my car scheduled in Moncton today, I made my way south into Nova Scotia. Time to follow the coastline counter clockwise all the way to the Newfoundland ferry. This was a cool place to visit. I just watched the two episodes of the Nova Scotia minehunters visiting this mine. I sure wish I could have gone in. tftec	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EXC_dorchester-copper-mine
Ranger Fox	Found it	9/3/2017	This was the main body of the trip. It was enjoyable to be up here, way farther north than I've ever cached on the east coast. I made sure to pause every now and then and get some photos and videos, especially when caches had us near lighthouses. We got on some roads where caches hadn't been found in two to three years. I was dubious at first, but after we began finding them, I supposed the locals had long before had their way with the caches and visitors such as ourselves hardly ever get around to those. And the awesome ditches and overgrowth continued. I continued using the Fun Run stamp until the last day, when salz69 and I were on our own, which we reverted to signing the logs normally with our handles. This area is so honest. Since we stayed away from the major towns, we got to see what the area was truly like: farmland, woodsy, tons of beaches, signs for potatoes (pay on the honor system), and so much more. We even drove past a few houses that were very patriotic, and one neighborhood where some houses had the Canadian flag, but most had this flag with a star on it, for something much closer to home. I enjoy seeing what an area is truly like, outside the tourist facade. For this area, I can't figure out where people go for some fun unless it's in the couple major towns. I did find some really great restaurants off the beaten path. If anything, I'd like to return just for that and sitting on a cliff, watching the water. This is the last of the batch of logs. It's the end of February. I know I was taking a while to verify the finds, so I stopped my other projects and just concentrated on looking through all the find logs to toss out the few when others broke off from the main run. (I'll admit, during all this time, I kept looking at the temperature in the area to see what it was like.) Now, for March, I need to resume working on my projects.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EXC_dorchester-copper-mine
AZ4X4s	Found it	9/3/2017	Greetings from the great state of Arizona I came up with the Fun Run team to do a little caching in the beautiful country of Canada, it sure is different than Arizona for sure the forest are beautiful and the people are just a delight to visit with, surely did have a great time finding all these caches !!!!

MrsSubman	Found it	9/3/2017	This was a fantastic 3 week trip to the 4 eastern provinces of Canadian and Maine. This is an area that I have always wanted to visit and explorer. What better way than meet some friends (FUN RUN) and cache while exploring a great area. The first two weeks in the mornings we met with some raining and wet ground cover. However, the sun came out and warmed up nicely. So, you dried out quickly, except the boots. The last 5 days it rained most of the time, but did allow for some caching and a lot of exploring. The Northeast provided wonderful views, while the locals were all very friendly. You could not pick a better spot to vacation. Thanks paulandstacey for your efforts to place these caches.and add to our fun. Answers have been provided by mate	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EXC_dorchester-copper-mine

Interesting to see the countryside and meet the nice local people. Very different caching than in the desert southwest where I am from. Challenge caches may be answered by viewing my stats or answers to others, earth caches and virtuals to be sent soon by myself or designated team member. Most caches were in decent shape. Thanks for the caches and good maintenance!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EXC_dorchester-copper-mine

salz69	Found it	9/3/2017	Ranger Fox and I met up with the rest of the Fun Run crew- Mondou2, Subman, irishmidz, dizziellama, AZ4x4's, k-romers, and tugies and hung with them- more eyes looking = way more fun!!- when it came time to call it for the evening, Ranger Fox and I decided to run over and grab the ones the others had already gotten- made for a long day into night, Fair Play is not just for whiny internet trolls, it's important for everyone!!! We replaced quite a few soggy logs,and busted containers but for the most part, everything was safe and sound, and ready to be found. All challenges that cannot be verified by my profile, virtuals and Earthcaches will be addressed as soon as possible by either myself of team members. Thanks for all your hard work!

Wow, I can't believe that nobody else has come here this year! It's quite an easy walk to GZ (although don't take a shortcut, there are large DEEP holes in the bush!) A fire had been held near the entrance, and the mine entrance was very foreboding. I must confess these always intrigue me, but I'm smart enough to not venture in :) Thanks for a great earthcache. A favourite point.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC14EXC_dorchester-copper-mine

K&A Enterprises	Found it	1/25/2020	I had planned to get an early start to geocaching but I wasted some time trying to log caches on the hotel Wi-Fi. When that failed, I drove down to my first stop of the day and got some BK then tried to log yesterday's caches on their Wi-Fi which was almost as bad as the hotel's. I then tried to use an Xfinity hotspot to find that internet was just was bad as the BK, maybe worse! I finally hit the road to a library just off the interstate where I finally had a good enough internet connection (and a keyboard) to log caches and plot out my game plan for the day. After that, it was southward to Louisville where there were a lot of caches I wanted to find. I grabbed a couple caches on my way into town and then came down to this beautiful cemetery to grab the earth caches. I am so glad I did! What a beautiful place; I am very glad I had an opportunity to visit.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

Beafrog	Found it	10/12/2019	Cemetery Earthcaches aren't very common and it amazes me that Cave Hill has several. Yet it's an interesting geological and geographical location and it's nice to learn lessons about different features within the grounds.

I love National Cemeteries for all the history and unique features. This place is like no other. We are here for my son's baseball tournament and finding the right time to get away was tricky. I arrived at 7:30 and had to kill some time (caching) outside until the gates opened. From there it was only a matter of time until I was able to reach the magical inside. This was one of my many stops. Took lots of pictures but will post at another time. Thank you for showing off this beautiful place. Geocaching continues to impress!

djbtex	Found it	8/12/2018	Day #7 of my epic road trip back to Texas from Massachusetts. Targeting earthcaches, virtuals, webcams, some high favorited caches, and some additional caches that I just happened upon when I stopped. I stopped at over 60 virtuals, earthcaches and a few challenges, along with other caches on my 8 day trip and I apologize for the delay in getting messages to owners. I enjoyed all of my stops but had very long days and was not able to send responses for information until I returned to Texas. All log dates reflect the day I visited the cache itself. I explored all of the earthcaches at Cave Hill Cemetery and enjoyed learning about the springs and the geology of the area. Definitely different than other earthcaches I have done in various cemeteries that typically focus on weathering of stones. My GPSr covered the icon up so I almost missed this one and the virtual. Once I clicked the found it on the first it was uncovered though so got them both.

schwandt	Found it	5/27/2018	My GeoWoodstock Giga roadtrip included seven days on the road, traveling through and caching in six states (Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Virginia) that included 270+ cache finds in 60+ counties, with the most popular type being Earthcaches, followed by virtual, unknowns, and lab caches. In addition to the Giga, I attended another event in Newark, Ohio. On Day 5, I put Geowoodstock and Cincinnati in the rear view mirror and headed southwest to Louisville and Indiana before starting the journey east toward northern Virginia. I was visiting Kentucky and Indiana counties, searching for challenge caches, virtual caches and Earthcaches along the way - plus some traditional caches to fill in some county gaps. I came to the cemetery for the virtual cache and was able to visit six Earthcaches also. A message has been sent with my responses.

Moun10Bike	Found it	5/27/2018	This was one of several fun and interesting stops for Moose Mob, Me & Bucky, and me while visiting Cave Hill Cemetery today. The grounds were in great shape for Memorial Day, but the molting geese here at the pond looked a little bedraggled! We joked with some fellow cachers in the way in asking them for “the answers” as we pulled up in our car and they gave us some humorous numbers . Message has been sent. Thanks for the EarthCache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

During our travels this past week we met a cacher who highly recommended your series of earthcaches. What a good suggestion it was! Thank you for setting them up, we appreciate the beauty and that they were relatively easy. Unfortunately we were unable to complete the series because the cemetery closed at 4:45, so sad!

krazyknuk	Found it	5/25/2018	Sweetpea67 and I had been in Cincinnati for the GIGA event with soooo many targeted caches to find. We knew Muhammed Ali was here and REALLY wanted to pay our respects. Finding out from the cachers we met along the paths we found out Colonel Sanders was also buried here so make no mistake we HAD to pay our respects to this Southern Genteman as well. This is THE most beautifully kept cemetery I have EVER been in and WOW.....so HUGE as well. Nothing like this where I come from....well unless you go to the large cities like Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and all the other Capital cities in Canada. While we had all the Earthcaches downloaded we decided to pick them up seeing as we were already here and cruising around. Met several other caches while doing the EC's and enjoyed their company as we walked a lot of the areas. Thank you for creating this EC for our caching pleasure.

Deut31-8	Found it	5/24/2018	I stopped in Louisville and the surrounding areas on my way to "GigaStock 2018" like so many others, and managed to stop by this neat earthcache. It took me awhile to make it down to ground zero because of what appeared to me as some bad attitude ducks. I pulled up in the parking lot and walked out to find a large group of ducks quacking loudly and rushing towards me. So I moved my parking spot to another area and as I got out, they spotted me and started charging at me again. I have seen people attacked by geese and wanted no part of it, so I parked much further away and made my way along the shoreline where those ducks could not see me. There I met a couple of cachers, MikeOtt and JeffS47. The ducks down here were much more friendly.

nukeworker	Found it	5/20/2018	While traveling through the area, to GeoWoodstock from our home in Arkansas, we're concentrating on new counties, virtuals, earthcaches, favorite points, challenges, and other hides that grab our attention. Not sure how we missed this EC when we visited the cemetery in 2012 during GWS in Sellersburg, but we did. So, today we came back. As we parked the truck we discovered a trackable on the vehicle in front of us. Sure enough, when we arrived at GZ we met 4 cachers from Oklahoma. We visited, exchanged more trackable numbers, and gathered the needed info for the earthcache. Our email has been sent and we appreciate the CO developing this geological lesson.

hortcacher	Found it	10/19/2017	I found this site very interesting. Based on the name of the cemetery I figured there was at least one cave. It would be interesting to explore it and see the bats. As I was collecting information at the bridge, a big goose snuck up behind me and nipped the back of my leg. That was a surprise! It did not hurt and the goose was otherwise not aggressive. Thanks for creating and maintaining this earthcache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
Nurse Nanna	Found it	10/16/2017	One of the most entertaining earthcaches that I've ever had the pleasure of completing. When I pulled in, there was a small car nearby and the folks inside it appeared to be trying to wave the local waterfowl (about 30 or so of them) out of the way so they could drive past. I parked a bit of a distance away and immediately drew the attention of all these feather coated squawkers who came waddling over to me and were all around me by the time I set foot out of my truck. I quickly learned that I was the featured attraction in this impromptu quacking parade. I with that I could post a video here, because I got a few seconds of the 3 or so minutes they accompanied my every step down the hill and to the cave. And, if you can imagine it....every one of them had a lot to say. It was a noisy walk down that hill, believe me. Found the answers I sought and hung out a few minutes while the party of 30 settled in around me and watched my movements. Are ducks considered muggles? I asked them, but for one tiny second they chose to remain mute...so I still don't know the answer to that question. Thank you for a most enjoyable...and educational earthcache. I'm fascinated by the caves down here and this added to my enjoyment of the area immensely! Nurse Nanna, proud Ironman mom (hence my visit) and curious visitor. I loved this area a lot!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
hikerT	Found it	10/13/2017	Travelling south to Indiana/Kentucky to attend the Falls of the Ohio event, so we made it into a 5 day road trip. Signed logs as HINK, (our initials) and targeted challenges, virtuals, oldies and 2 geoarts. The weather cooperated the entire time and we were able to check all the caches off our wish list. Thanks to all the CO's who placed caches for us to find.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
vorlon40	Found it	10/13/2017	I wasn't sure I was going to survive the ducks, geese and swans that were "speaking" to me about being in their area. I love this cemetery. It reminds me of Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. Very fun exploring the area. TFTC! Answers sent. On an epic road trip from St. Louis to visit relatives in MD. Along the way we had to do some caching of course. One of our primary goals was to spend a few days in Martinsburg, WV on the 2 active Geo-trails in Berkeley Co, which feature WVTim gadget and smart caches. We had a great time completing both of them. We only failed at 2 of the 29 we attempted. We even got an FTF on one of the WVTim MCBC caches that was re-published while we were nearby! We loved getting some fresh produce and products from the local farms we visited along the "trails". We also booked a train ride in the mountains from Cumberland to Frostburg but we were foiled by a broken "sand thrower". They tried to leave the station twice but had to back up both time, finally giving up after 3 hours. The leaves were turning in the mountains making for some beautiful drives. The additional caches we visited also took us to some historic locations on our 2500 mile trip, which included many nice virtual and earth caches. Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, KY was especially interesting as were some of the Civil War battlefields. #1336: 9th of 16 found today. 54th of 61 found on this trip.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

iowaPete	Found it	10/5/2017	This earth cache was part and parcel of our defensive posture while encountering the local avian guardians of the cave. Able to snap a pic of the sign that provided the information needed to complete this earth cache. Would've loved an opportunity to explore this cave. Mrs. iowaPete spent a number of college weekends near Purdue University, exploring caves with a group of regulars. When we started dating, she convinced me to join her for a day of caving. It's incredible to me that there are such huge expanses of empty space underneath what I used to think was "solid" ground. We were underground for the better part of 6 hours that day. An experience that I remember distinctly. White-nose syndrome is a real threat to the local bat populations, so we both understand the need to stay out of the caves in order to protect a fragile part of the ecosystem. Thanks for another amazing earth cache! Answers will be sent after this log is completed... iowaPete	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

SpursUp11	Found it	9/2/2017	Drove up from Dothan Alabama to Hillsboro Ohio so that my wife and daughter could spend the weekend with my wife's family and get some fair time. What to do with my free time while they are occupied?? I think I will go do some caching!! Had big plans for today, some were met some fell short but I had an awesome day regardless. Plan was for Tom Sawyer to be my #3,000 Traditional cache and my overall #4,000. I was successful in making it my 3,000th Traditional but didn't quiet make it to 4,000 because of traffic, unfamiliarity with the city and spending too much time on a few caches. I will get to 4,000 tomorrow but need to decide what cache to make the milestone and get it figured out quick. Thanks to all that hid caches for me to find and making my day great. Thanks for the Earth Cache and Thanks for the smiley!!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
LoyalDipity	Found it	8/22/2017	Well now that was an event full and challenging cache!! I was chased by ducks/geese. As soon as the car stopped they came at me. The faster I walked the faster their little legs ran after me. I got to the bottom of the hill and another flank of mallards came at me from the left. I got to the bridge and ANOTHER flanked me from the right WITH a big black swan. Good Grief what an adventure!!! Luckily I was much faster up the hill than any of them and made a swift get away!!!

We are traveling from Detroit to Louisville, KY and Nashville, TN to experience the total solar eclipse (and, of course, caching along the way). I was wondering if we would ever get here! It took us two hours to drive 1 mile near Cincinnati. With time so short, we had to pick and choose our finds. This stop was fascinting! Good thing, though, I had TaGeez to protect my backside from water fowl while collecting my answers! Email sent with qualifiers - Thank you to all the CO's for adding to our experience!

While we were here, we met the man who feeds the ducks and swans, and we got to help feed them out of our hands and learn about the other animals in the cemetery. A very interesting cave and I wish that I would have had more time to explore the cave and the area. While we were here getting the answers, we met the man who was feeding the ducks, and we got to help! Answers have been sent. Thank you very much for the Earthcache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
InxtricablFate	Found it	7/14/2017	County: Jefferson Delorme Page: KY-035 Found with magtfplanner, skeletor10, and memomls Thanks to all the cache owners who placed these caches for us to find. Logging these now many months late. Sorry to the COs for not giving a great log where deserved.. Time to catch up on well over 1000 caches backlogged for various reasons. If there is an ALR, the answers were sent long ago by my teammates (will resend if deemed necessary). Pics posted where required. Adventure Log: Over our travels of the past few years, magtfplanner and I have laid waste to nearly half of the US Counties . A challenge cache found last year required that we connect the Lower 48 with a solid county-to-county line. Upon examining our maps, we decided what one of our major goals for 2017 would be.; a week-long Midwest trip could connect 4 sections, thereby connecting everything. Another major draw for this trip was claiming 2 more Cache Across America caches [KY and MS], which would put my total to 47, and 3 more State's Oldest [KY, TN, and AR], putting that total to 31. As has become typical, and expected, on this sort of trip, we averaged over 50 caches and over 400 miles per day. memomls and Skeletor10, when they were able to keep up, would send in our Virtual and Earthcache answers almost as soon as we had them, leaving us less to worry about when we got home with 100s of caches to log. magtfplanner and I kept things moving at a good pace and we accomplished all of our goals., despite a major time setback in Lexington. In our 6 days, we claimed 340 total caches!! (225 Traditional, 55 Virtual, 26 Mystery, 26 Earthcache, 4 Multi, 2 Letterbox, 1 Wherigo, 1 Webcam, and 46 Benchmarks) Summer 2017: This year magtfplanner and I orchestrated a most ambitious and exhausting summer with little rest time between trips. This made some of the last-minute trip modifications a bit more difficult but we managed to slog our way through all of our goals. Of course, this left no time for logging so they are all being logged weeks after the fact, hopefully before the finale trip. June 10: New RM challenges, Dollar Puzzle-Art, and Video Game series around Vero Beach, FL. June 11: A very short "local" caching run June 15-20: West Virginia County and Delorme Challenge completion June 24: Numbers Run in Ocala, FL - June 25: Some local caching in NW Jacksonville June 29-July 4: Louisiana Parish and Delorme Challenges July 8-9: Another Numbers weekend around Ocala. July 13-18: Contiguous Counties connection Trip (Finish connecting lower 48) Grand Finale August 23-September 6: Eurotrip - 15 Countries, MEGA in Switzerland, GIGA in Czech Republic	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
skeletor10	Found it	7/14/2017	Found while on a week long caching trip across America with memomls, magtfplanner and InxtricablFate. The goal is counties, counties, and more counties! Our trip starts in Nashville, and we will meander our way through TN, KY, IN, IL, MO, AR, MS, and AL, collecting counties and Delorme pages along the way. We also targeted other caches of interest including virtuals, earthcaches, challenges, and others with high favorite points. The answers to the earthcaches and virtuals were submitted by memomls on behalf of the group. Unless otherwise noted, all caches were found in good shape, log was signed, and cache returned to its hiding spot. Please read magtfplanner's log for more details about our visit. Thank you for contributing to this awesome adventure!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
magtfplanner	Found it	7/14/2017	Cache Log: We got mobbed by the denizens of Cave Hill, pretty much as soon as we rolled into the GZ . Made for some good pictures . Eventually, we made our way down to the cave to get back down to business . Memomls sent in the answers for the team. TFTV! Day 2 Log: Day 2 sneaks up on us at midnight and we are still playing in Lexington - - WAY behind schedule . We finished up our last couple of targets and then shot over to Frankfort to visit the state capitol . After that we caught a very short nap in a park n ride and then our party rolled into Louisville in the early morning hours where we made the 1st round of cuts to our targets list (benchmarks 1st ) to start the process of putting our schedule back on track . Best Part of the Day = Spring Hill, hands down. That place was pretty darn cool ! From Louisiville our route pushed almost directly west for the rest of the day across IN and IL, making it as close as we could to St. Louis (Mt Vernon) before we had to accept that we’d pick up the rest of the slack somewhere along the route on day 3 . By the time we checked in to our hotel for the night we found 84 caches, including 45 Traditionals, 16 Virtuals, 12 Earthcaches, 7 Mysteries, 1 Letterbox, 1 Multi, 1 WherIGo, 1 Webcam, and 14 Benchmarks ! Adventure Log: Found with inxtricablfate (IXF), skeletor10 (SK10), and memomls on a 6 day road trip through TN, KY, IN, IL, MO, AR, and MS . And what a road trip it was ! Our goal for the trip was to take 4 separate sections of counties on our map and run the finds between them from county to county until we had successfully connected all 48 contiguous states . Our route started off in Nashville, TN; meandered north toward Louisville, KY; cut west to St. Louis, MO; took a round-about way into Jefferson City, MO; shot south to Searcy, AR (just north of Little Rock); and finally back east into Nashville through Memphis, TN and Tishomingo, MS . In 5 days we covered more than 2200 miles, averaging about 440 miles per day with 50-70 finds each day . Despite staying around the Nashville area the last (half) day, we still tacked on an additional 200 miles, rounding us out at 2400 miles in just 6 days time ! Since this is the only road trip we took this year that was not focused on completing a specific state (i.e. WV and LA) we had some flexibility to play with our route to make it bring us right where we wanted to go . This enabled us to finally track down the Cache Across America (CAA) finals in KY and MS; visit the state capitol buildings in KY and MO; and locate the oldest in KY, TN, and AR. Not only that, but we were able to spend quite a bit of time on the freeways / highways, rather than the winding country backroads, so for the most part we made great time enroute from stop to stop . Thanks to the combined efforts and specialties of our caching crew for this trip, we executed a relatively flawless trip (minus the day 1 timing hiccup ) and maximized our time . I glued myself to the driver seat and got us to each find quickly and safely . IXF took the co-pilots chair to manage the navigation and overall trip timing, working through the frustration whenever I ignored his directions . SK10 kept his phone at the ready to provide supplemental satellite imagery whenever we needed a bird’s eye view of a GZ . Memomls took on the mantle as our scribe, keeping our social media accounts actively tagged and sending answers to COs whenever we completed an earthcache or virtual. Because of this awesome team dynamic we managed to secure a whopping 340 Total finds for the trip, including 225 Traditionals, 54 Virtuals, 27 Mysteries, 26 earthcaches, 4 Multis, 2 Letterboxes, 1 WherIGo, 1 Webcam, and 46 Benchmarks . A big thanks to each of the COs who hid the many caches we found on this extended weekend adventure . We couldn’t do what we do with you . Happy Caching !	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
memomls	Found it	7/14/2017	Loved this cemetery, will definitely come back. Favorite point from this cacher. Another (probably my last, darn health issues) crazy, jammed packed caching trip with InxtricablFate, magtfplanner, and Skeletor10. The goal this time--connect all the counties! After this trip IXF and mag will have all their counties connected. Me? I still have some work to do. But this trip puts me over 33% of the US counties. As usual we're targeting counties, Delorme pages, virtuals, earth caches, and the ever shrinking webcams. The trip may be tough, the stats are great at the end. I apologize for the cut and paste log but I do appreciate the co's placement and maintaining if these caches.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
reindeer	Found it	6/23/2017	Fund #4019 am 23. June 2017 um 14:48 U.S.A - Kanada Kentucky/Indiana - Ontario/Quebec [GER] Auf unserer Urlaubsreise konnten wir auch wieder ein paar Caches suchen und finden. Bei so mancher Naturschönheit haben wir uns sehr über einen Earth-Cache freuen können und auch von den bei uns so seltenen "virtual caches" konnten wir einige besuchen. Natürlich durften dann ganz normale Caches nicht fehlen, gesucht haben wir aber nur solche, die direkt auf dem Weg lagen und schnell gefunden werden konnten. Manchmal gab uns ein Cache auch Anlass zu einem schönen Ausflugsziel, das wir wahrscheinlich ansonsten nicht gefunden oder besucht hätten. Ein großes "Danke-Schön" an die Cache-owner für das Ausarbeiten und Pflegen der Caches. Viele Grüße an dieser Stelle aus Bayern (Deutschland). Man möge mir hier diesen Einheitslog verzeihen, wenn es zu einem Cache etwas Besonderes zu erwähnen gab, dann folgt dies in nachfolgendem fettgedruckten Absatz: [ENG] On our vacation trip we could again search and find a few caches. With so many natural beauty, we were able to look forward to an Earth cache, and we were able to visit some of the "virtual caches" we have so rare in our country. Of course we could not miss normal caches, but we only looked for those who were right on the way and could be found quickly. Sometimes a cache gave us a nice excursion destination, which otherwise we probably would not have found or visited. A great "thank you" to the cache owner for working out and maintaining the caches. Many greetings at this point from Bavaria (Germany). Let me forgive this unit log, if there was something special to mention to a cache, it is written in the following bold paragraph: [FRA] Sur nos vacances, nous pourrions aussi chercher quelques caches et les retrouver. Avec tant de beauté naturelle, nous devons être très heureux au sujet d'un cache de la Terre et aussi du si rare dans nos « caches virtuelles », nous avons pu visiter quelques-uns. Bien sûr, alors caches normales ne sont pas absents, mais nous voulions que ceux qui étaient sur le chemin et pourrait être rapidement trouvé. Parfois, un cache nous a donné aussi la cause pour une belle destination que nous aurions probablement pas autrement été trouvé ou visité. Un grand « merci » au propriétaire du cache pour la conception et la maintenance des caches. Meilleurs voeux à ce point de Bavière (Allemagne). On peut me pardonner ce Einheitslog s'il y avait un cache de mentionner quelque chose de spécial ici, ce suit au paragraphe ultérieur en gras: - Vielen Dank sagt:reindeerhttp://www.reindeer-geocaching.de/	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

mrahudson	Found it	6/2/2017	I didn't think we would be able to get the answers here. After dodging the geese to get near the info a black swan came out of the water and started chasing me down. It was about to get hit with my notebook but it retreated back into the water and I was able to get to the sign. You would never know this was here if you were just driving around.

thekingofbattle	Found it	1/15/2017	Today is day two of my "epic" Kentucky caching trip...courtesy of my snuggle-muggle...yesterday was spent sprinting all around Lexington and the surrounding area finding and logging as many non-traditionals as I could possible get to before exhaustion came over me. I did visit a number of virtuals...a web cam...logged some large container traditionals...and a ton of challenge caches! Today I was able to log the oldest cache in the state and then the focus was going to be on EarthCaches...I've noticed that I've been neglectful of finding (and sometimes logging) them...and once I saw the absolute concentration of them in Louisville, I knew that's where I had to go. I picked some other types up along the way of course...but the focus was on ECs. This cemetery is absolutely fascinating...I felt like I was getting lost driving all over the place, but in reality it wasnt that bad. This EC was the fourth one along my route...the weather was not necessarily the best...scattered rain showers, but I didnt mind...I mean, I'm out caching, so I wont complain that much! My answers for the requirements have already been sent! Thanks for placing and maintaining this EC for the rest of us! No spelunking occurred while gathering the information!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

GR8CACHERS	Found it	7/30/2016	I am in town for a few days visiting with my sister who has lived in Louisville almost 40 years. She is familiar with this cemetery, however she is a muggle when it comes to geocaching. We visited all six earth caches here. Upon doing so, we made another gr8 find.....the final resting place of Muhammad Ali!!!! It looks like there are plans for a memorial here. I am sure it will be amazing. Of course we took pictures here. My sister was quite impressed with geocaching now. Wink, wink. Later we found Colonel Sanders grave, too. Thank you for the lessons and for bringing me to places I would not have seen had it not been for geocaching.

DinaWorks	Found it	7/1/2016	12579: Stopped here on a roadtrip with my daughter from Chicago to Chattanooga. Funny story: Because my daughter is not super into geocaching, I was trying to be very selective about my targets. We stayed the night near here so, when I thought I'd grab a quick one before our morning coffee, I ran a filtered search for just virtuals. After completing the nearby virtual, I thought to myself, "I'm surprised that's not actually an earthcache." Then I had the "a ha" moment, turned off the filter and saw the two earthcaches I could easily nab, even without caffeine. My answers have been sent. TFTE, AirRaidFan!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
dcdawn	Found it	6/24/2016	When I was sitting in my vehicle at the top the hill and confirming the location of the virtual, I discovered this earthcache was in the same place. I quickly read through the description. Cool...an easy earthcache in a place I was already headed! Plus, it gave me interesting backround info.

MJBinski	Found it	5/20/2016	Awesnap and I left well before sunrise on 5/20/2016 for an epic two-day geocaching trip which included a great mix of "must have" caches. Our journey included caches in Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. With a majority of our finds being Virtuals, Earthcaches, or Challenge Caches, answers or proof of qualification will soon follow (if not previously submitted) via email. Overall, my total cache find was 100. Some people might sneeze at these numbers for a two-day caching trip, but this trip was about quality not quantity. This trip included a lot of driving and a lot of planning. We shared in the driving duties, but Awesnap did all the planning. A big thank you goes out to my good friend Awesnap for inviting me on this trip and for doing all the planning for this "military operation." Many thanks to all the cache owners for all the great caches. Keep on Cachin'! Awesnap submitted answers for the both of us. Adding a collage of pics as proof of my visit. Thanks for the Earth Cache!

Awesnap	Found it	5/20/2016	Cache Clown 76 and I are on a weekend trip to grab quite a few “must have” caches such as virtuals, challenges, and the oldest caches in Kentucky and Ohio. I was looking forward to this Cemetery Man since the inception of this trip, but Maaaan, It rained cats and dogs on us while we were here. Dang. With the Rain slowing us down. after Frankfort when the rain started we had to make a choice. This cemetery or the Smile Webcam. As much as I love webcams I had already done the homework for these 5 Earthcaches, plus there was that nearby Virtual, so we felt that this was a higher priority. We arrived here after 3:45pm with a closing time of 4:45pm. So we had to work fast knowing that would only get us wetter. I pulled out my bright yellow Pancho thinking I would take the blunt of the answer hunting. Nope, not with Cache Clown 76. He is like a honey badger, he just don’t care about rain. Not him. He just charged out in front of me in all his cotton and sneaker glory. Ha hah! He looked like a soaked cat after we left here! We came here for the virtual, and I am late logging this one. Drivers fatigue and logging 96 caches when returned. Thanks for this cool series!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

WadeH	Found it	4/16/2016	Found during a mini geo=cation to Louisville with the wife. What a beautiful cemetery this is! We were a bit concerned when we saw all the geese on guard near the entrance to the cave (we've had more than one less than great experience with nesting geese in the past!) but fortunately for us, these geese were only concerned with whether or not we had any food for them, once they realized we didn't they were completely oblivious to us! Email has been sent to the email address provided with the required answers.

So I decided I had some time this morning. Very glad I did, this place is so cool. Ended up spending a couple of hours with earthcaches and looking at stones. The weather was even beautiful. Message sent. A goose sat at the opening of the cave and stared at me the whole time I was collecting my information. As opposed to the ones swimming and staring at me, and the ones following me waiting for treats. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

iPajero	Found it	7/22/2015	These six earth caches in this cemetery certainly looked intriguing and after spending the night at Shepherdsville we headed for here. This is the first cemetery that we have entered that has any gate control and we can see why. The arboretum here is beautiful and there appears to be a lot of wealth with the building of the graves as well. We enjoyed coming here and doing these earth caches and were amazed that as many as six earth caches could be developed in such a small area. Wonderful to see the ponds and they appear turquoise this morning. Thanks for the earth cache. Our Travel Companion TB31M47 and Cache Mobile TB59EG4 came along for the ride. [b]Greetings from South Africa![/b] A bit on our background: At the outset of our holiday we had found 11656 caches (all done in southern Africa) and this is this first time we are caching on another continent. The logo on our 'all terrain' caching mobile reads "I would rather be lost in the woods than found in the city" and our travel companion TB has traveled over 195 000 kilometers achieving this milestone as we have explored the wide open and untamed expanses of southern Africa. It is, therefore, with some trepidation that we set out caching in the vast expanse of USA with its enormous cities and massive network of freeways in a first world country. Having overcome encounters with dangerous wild animals (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, hyenas and hippopotamus) in game parks, this does give us a degree of confidence that we will be up to any challenge the USA may have for us. A quote that we hold dear reads "Every morning you are handed 24 golden hours. They are one of the few things in this world that you get free of charge. If you had all the money in the world, you couldn't buy an extra hour. What will you do with this priceless treasure?". While in the USA we will endeavor to use the hours we have to discover as much of the country as possible and find some caches along the way.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

It's Cache O Palooza in the New Albany slash Louisville area today for me, FievelGoes, MamaCass, and kblookers. We have much in store, including the Big Blue Smiley, Kentucky's oldest and many, many more! We signed the log MKF1939. I'm in New Albany and Floyd County for 8 weeks beginning the last week of March. The University of Indianapolis summer archeological field school is conducting survey work on several properties to help us understand more about the early history and prehistory of this beautiful region. While Clark, Harrison and Crawford Counties have seen a lot of work, Floyd has had comparatively little attention from archeologists and we hope to remedy that! While here it is my plan to cache as much of the area and nearby counties as possible (sometimes with FievelGoes and Mipsy). We love the scenery, the history, and the recreational quality of Floyd County's parks, streams, and byways. Thanks to all the COs who make them that much better! You all are so lucky to live in such a scenic part of our great state! Thanks to the CO for the great hide and all you do to contribute to the game! Your efforts are greatly appreciated!

yellowjeeperman	Found it	4/5/2015	Had a bit of a mishap here that luckily didn't end in disaster. While heading down to grab this earth cache, we were trying to avoid muddy spots and the local cache guardians. If anyone remembers there were crazy rains earlier in the week. So basically everything was muddy. Unfortunately the wife took a nasty spill right at GZ. Her phone went flying deep into a mud spot and thankfully not into the pond. So selfies became unimportant and we just decided to head back to the car. Luckily no serious injuries just bruises to the body, ego and a dirty phone. Wow. Sorry for the incredibly late logs on these earthcaches. I didn't want to log these before submitting the answers and we just never got around to getting all the answers and pictures together. Finally done. I'd like to say we had a blast here at Cave Hill. Never seen a cemetery quite like it. And wow the geese were crazy territorial while we were here caching, but we still had fun. Happy Easter Roadtrippin today. Gorgeous spring day for caching. Having a blast. Thanks for the earthcache ARF!. Found April 5, 2015 12:54 PM. Cache number 4954.

GuentherGal	Found it	11/13/2014	After flying into Cincinnati, Chuck and I set off on a 1,000 mile road trip, looping through Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan. One of our goals was to try and get as many icons in each state as possible. Knowing we would be hitting nearby Cherokee Park, we took a look at Cave Hill Cemetery and realized we could get most of the categories right here. This afternoon we made our way over and did several of the caches here. After parking, we took the trek downhill and checked out the area. With a stiff wind blowing, we noticed it had started to flurry. Wow, now that’s a nice cave! You could tell from the look on Chuck’s face he wanted nothing more than to try and get in there! This cache was actually the one that convinced us to add this stop to our itinerary. What a great decision that was! We read the signs, took some notes and snapped a few pictures before moving along. By the time we made it back to the truck we were nearly frozen. We sure appreciate your placing this; it was a nice addition to our day. An email with the requested info has been sent. Thanks for the fantastic fall fun.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill
Uncle Fuzzy	Found it	11/13/2014	This was one of our favorites. I can't believe I almost forgot to log it. For some reason it seems to get hidden underneath the virtual on the map.

Thanks ARF for showing us so many places during our visit. Too bad there were many more we just didn't have time for. Maybe we'll make it back this way some time. Take care now.

Team Monke	Found it	11/8/2014	Was out with Pociusposse and Mrs. Boydfamily for a girls weekend away. We considered selling our husbands to nomadic gypsies and high tailing it to Europe, but we couldn't find any takers. So we had to keep it close to home (Dayton, Ohio). We decided on the lovely town of Louisville. We have hit quite a few caches in the area, and decided to tour this beautiful cemetery. Usually earthcaches are not my thing, but these were wonderful. Thanks for the cache and for the lesson!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

jREST	Found it	10/11/2014	Stopped here this afternoon on a weekend road trip with Boreal Walker and Yellowdogs. Down here in Louisville, KY for the Falls of Ohio Hike. Have today to check things out with a few caches on the list before getting wet tomorrow. A day early in town is allowing us time to roam around with special and specific caches on the radar, this was one of them. Enjoyed the day, finding random things in the area with plenty of interesting caches to find!! We ended up in this cemetery after several of other hides, and we were successful in the EC and VC hides before closing time. Met up with some other folks here and discussed what we were doing, they thought it sounds really interesting and might just go check out the website... We then gathered the details we needed and were off in search of other things to see... Thanks for setting this one up. Making for a fun filled adventure today!!!

Boreal Walker	Found it	10/11/2014	Yellowdogs, jREST, and I had an extra day to cache in the Louisville area. We decided to take advantage of this fact and grab a lot of different random caches that everyone contributed to. It was a nice day to just wander around enjoying the sights. We decided to hit up Cave Hill People Garden at just the right time. We barely grabbed the six earthcaches and virtual before the gates closed. We really wanted to go exploring here, but they had sounded the horn. We gathered the answers and chatted with some muggles that were interested in our treasure hunt. Nice geology lesson here.

yellowdogs	Found it	10/11/2014	Boreal Walker, jREST and I drove from Minnesota to attend The Falls of the Ohio Hike -2014.

superjosh92	Found it	5/8/2014	Found during day 3 of my (tentative) three week solo Appalachian trip. Started in Lousville, KY and ended in Elizabethtown, KY. I had a fun experience here. Was sitting down to read all of the information on the spot here when I was approached by a nearby Canadian. I was worried he was going to bite me until I saw a tag on his leg. He just wanted some food. In Michigan these guys stay far away from us so it was a new experience.

indymonk	Found it	3/30/2014	Came down to Louisville to cache at Cave Hill Cemetery with my wife; on a beautiful sunny day. It's about time; it has been a long brutal winter. The daffodils were blooming and grass was green. What a wonderful place. So much to see and history to observe. The military section is amazing. Makes you stop and think of the sacrifices made for our freedom. Now back to the caching. This was another stop on our day adventure. I've never heard of a cemetery closing at 4:30 before. THANKS for bringing us to this location. Definately earns a favorite point. Answers and photo to follow. Icing on the cake was listening to Kentucky beat Michigan on my way home to Indy. GO CATS.

dr_mikes	Found it	6/15/2013	The kids, g-ma and I were on our way home but I wanted to stop here. I have passed this cemetery a couple of times while in town because we were meeting other people from our dance academy and never had time to stop. Today I wanted to make sure we got here for a couple of the caches in the area before heading home. What a really cool cemetery here. We enjoyed the variety of trees and the swans and geese. I usually enjoy grabbing earthcaches, but will many times save them for when the kids are with me so that we all get an education together. It is such a shame about the white nose disease. A few days ago we went to a presentation on bats and it was pointed out how devastating the disease is here, but that the European bats don't seem to have a problem fending it off. tftec answers sent.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

CC Land Pirates	Found it	3/23/2013	Today would be #3000! Twenty one months in to our new hobby, and our passion for all parts of the game has only gotten stronger. We had originally planned a subdued trip to the Andersen, Indiana Equinox event for the occasion. However, our love of the grandiose soon had us eyeballing a 40 cache Louisville itinerary with an astounding 1420 favorite points! Many of the caches were going to be difficult and time-consuming, so we gave ourselves a 13 cache cushion. We left at 8AM and 13 hours later returned home with the following accomplishments under our family belt: -Overcame the shocking 4G statement "I can't find a single cache on the Oregon 450!" -28/31 finds with #3000 coming at the amazing Raining Letters puzzle -Finding six different cache types in one day -Snagging six TBs and three geocoins and dropping 4 and some of our first gen path tags -Procuring CCLP's new and trackable talisman at Choctaw Jim's(Wall Drug of the Midwest) -Having a 'vacation' like day in mid-March to get us refreshed for the final push of our various semesters We were mesmerized by the beauty of this place, its' many and varied old trees and historical significance.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1DBZ2_the-spring-at-cave-hill

TeamMCH	Found it	1/5/2013	I am working on a challenge cache near home in Indianapolis (GC39FPX) http://coord.info/GC39FPX to log as many non-traditional caches as possible in a 30-day period. I had great intentions of racking up a bunch of caches over the holidays, but the snowstorm has really thrown a wrench into my plans. So I have had to be very selective about which caches to pursue in order to maximize the probability of making a find. Today we decided to venture down to Louisville to do some shopping - and were happy to see no snow! We lived in Louisville from 1990-94 and have fond memories of this area. After doing a couple of caches over on Frankfort Ave, we headed to Cave Hill. From 1991-94, we lived in the next to last house at the end of Highland Avenue - so we could see across the wall into the cemetery. And as a pastor, I performed a number of funerals in here. This is a beautiful cemetery, but especially in the spring when all the trees are flowering. Thanks for bringing us back here with this series of Earthcaches! This was the 6th cache of the 10 total we found for the day. After taking care of business at [url=http://coord.info/GC1DCTN]Cave Hill Karst Ponds EC[/url], this was the next cache on our radar. It took us 3 minutes between finds. The mob of waterfowl we picked up at the last cache followed us over here - it made H a little nervous. This is the best view of the spring I have ever had as usually I saw it from across the way - or was passing by on the road above it. It is interesting how far back it goes. And since we were already standing here, the next cache in our sights was [url=http://coord.info/GC8B5B]The Spring[/url]. This is find #921 for TeamMCH.

kungfuhippie	Found it	6/24/2012	Found with hikingmonkey and the kiddos as part of our family vacation down to the Great Smoky Mountains which spanned 100+ caches over 10 states including a FTF 600 miles from home, the GPS Maze and in general just a whole lot of fun family times. We enjoyed everything from PNGs to hikes up into the mountains, classics to newly published caches and just about every cache type out there; thanks to all the COs who put these out for us to chase down! The boys enjoyed visiting over here to socialize with the waterfowl, but I was more intrigued by the information about the cave. Thanks for sharing so many of these interesting locations with us, I'm looking forward to another trip to the area to explore some more!

Curly Girls	Found it	6/10/2012	What a beautiful cemetery! We enjoyed driving around and looking and looking. I decided we needed to stop and find at least one cache while here so we can say we visited. This is so different than the cemetery next door. We were shocked to see the razor wire on the fence between the two. It does appear they cleaned up and blocked up the building next door. Seems alot of people know of it, as in our short time there, many people drove in as well to look and wander. Thanks for the information on the springs, it is enjoyable to learn a little along the way too rather than just signing a slip of paper.

geoconsumer	Found it	5/27/2012	With Geowoodstock's 10th anniversary anchoring the weekend, this was the big geocaching adventure of the year. I headed down on Wednesday night to knock a few hours off the drive to the Louisville area before spending some time in Fort Wayne. Most of the time on Thursday was spent in Indianapolis hunting mainly for Challenges and Virtuals. On the way to Louisville, I visited a couple Virtuals in Columbus, Indiana. In the Clarksville/Louisville area, the caching turned out better than expected with a lot of solved Mystery caches, qualified Challenge Caches, Earth Caches, Virtuals and Traditional caches to round things out. There were even two web cam finds on the trip. I also finished off the last spot in my Date Placed grid. A group of us also went out to grab counties in Kentucky and on the way back to Michigan.

jim&jackie	Found it	5/25/2012	We're visiting from California on our way to Geowoodstock. We ran into Alamogul and Materus in the cemetery and joined forces to conquer the Earthcaches. As we progressed through the cemetery, we gathered the necessary information and took the requisite pictures. It's always more enjoyable when we meet cachers in the field and also when the caches help us learn about the area.

The geese worried me a little. Thank God captain J protected me from them. In Alabama they are known to attack. I look forward to returning to this cemetery and finding more of the caches in the area...I really look forward to moving to Louisville. It has been a pleasure these past couple of days being here.

KelseyNJ	Found it	3/25/2019	#3,857 Last night while brainstorming ideas about how to spend our Monday off work somewhere within a day trip's driving distance from the northwest tip of Salem County, my husband and I consulted the geocaching map's satellite view via MacBook in hopes of discovering a worthwhile destination neither of us have visited together. Typically we stick to semi-familiar spots south of I-295's exit 36 or so because anything beyond that is basically North Jersey in our fake redneck minds, and North Jersey is... depressingly urban, chock full of busting city bull crap, NYC's ugly twin sister, hell in a nutshell, "basically Alabama's" mortal enemy. Yerp, ain't our jawn. However, the Delaware Water Gap area and other rural mountain towns far enough west from Newark, Hackensack, Union, Hoboken, Seacaucus, Englewood, The Oranges, etc. are an extreme exception. All things considered, we aimed for the Sparta vicinity via a serpentine scenic route skirting the shore of Lake Hopatcong. Why Sparta? Because the name is laughable thanks to nostalgic inside jokes and there are two obviously advertised educational mining sties nearby. Unfortunately Sterling Hill Mining Museum closes at 3:00 PM and we would never make it to Ogdensburg on time for a fluorescent subterranean tour of minerals glowing beneath blacklights. Therefore we opted for the "The Edison Mines" earth cache inside Sparta Mountain Wildlife Management Area 2.5 hours northeast from home. Several smiley snagging pit stops were made along the way there and back; this was one of ten. Aww man, where do I even begin!? This seemingly forgotten place is ineffably awesome and totally worth the drive, if not for the historic geology lesson then for the two cavey/climby traditional caches located along the healthy hike required to fully comprehend and appreciate all this abandoned iron mining operation has to offer. Four star terrain rating requiring a risky rocky descent down onto loose bouldery stepping stones jutting out from an abandoned iron ore mine flooded with vibrant blueish-green water? Heck, count me in! A real doozy was had here, and as frustrated as I was, I seriously contemplated throwing in the towel and posting a depressing DNF, but I persevered and scampered away with a smiley. Let's just say that this whole ordeal could have ended a whole lot worse than a wet foot, a scraped knuckle, and a concerned significant other. Thanks a million for bringing us to this unforgettably amazing attraction chock full of epic abandoned areas which we hope to revisit sometime soon (as in sometime before we die), treequest! And thanks for teaching me that not all of North Jersey is as horrendous as I had once thought. P.S. Shout out to the 4/15/19 finder who unfortunately endured a frigid fall into the mineral enriched floodwaters. At least he/she scored his/her smiley too!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC17PWM_the-victor-mine

andGuest	Found it	7/7/2018	Well I think after making the find I have 3 things to say. First it needs maintenance as without the lid it was full of water and the log is not signable. Second is I am guessing a lot of the DNFs are due to cachers hint hunting. Go straight for the hint and if not there move along. Third, I guess the most recent DNFers don't read cache logs either. I actually had not read the CO log about its new location. When I didn't find the cache myself in the logical spots or where the hint suggests (I looked due to the DNFs), I searched elsewhere and came up with it in a few minutes. I re-hid it as found.

FBS67	Found it	6/23/2012	Found with DC as we cached in the park area while staying at the nearby camping area. Enjoyed the hike and searching for this one's information...if only more of it had been there. We gathered some of the info from other sources to help with our answers to the CO who was very gracious. These are some of our favorite caches taking us to places we may have never seen or known about otherwise. Great caching weather this weekend. DC sent our answers and other info. This would be a great spot on some summer days. The change was amazing...and I thought my basement was cool! Incredeible when we usually think of the Earth having a molten core (volcanoes) versus this level. Thanks for another great spot to visit.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC17864_ice-mine
DaisyChain	Found it	6/23/2012	Found with FBS67. This park is a treasure. We loved our stay. We enjoyed all the earthcaches and the other hikes we did. We were surprised to see the name of a MD cacher on these so far from home. We were amazed at the change in temperature. It felt refreshing. Unfortunately there is a porcupine that enjoys eating interpretative signs here in the park. The one here was missing. Then when the ranger put up a sign explaining why the other sign was missing, he ate that one too. Good job on the caches and thanks for the fun.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC17864_ice-mine

GeoSciTchr	Found it	2/4/2012	While pre planning a caching type hike this past week Sql_Geek stumbled across some hiking info on this scenic state park. After seeing there were 3 interesting earthcaches in the park and many of the pics on multiple resources, we made the decision this would be our destination without hesitation. Left the home GZ Saturday am at 0600, and arrived at the park about 3 hrs later. Temps in the high 30's, overcast but no precipitation, no snow on the ground, and few people in the park made this to be an excellent day for the hike. Will send answers to CO. TFT adventure, and giving us an excellent reason to visit this beautiful park.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC17864_ice-mine
sql_geek	Found it	2/4/2012	Found with GeoSciTchr on a great little trip for a hike in Trough Creek SP and Rothrock SF. This was the final stop for the day, after a loop on the Brumbaugh Trail.

Bittersoul	Found it	3/26/2011	This was absolutely amazing, but we had poor, poor timing as there was an entire team of microbiologists crawling all over every part of the Ice Mine today. We gathered as much information as we could, chatted a bit, and attempted to look inconspicuous, but like all good scientists they wanted to stay focused on their work and we were just getting in the way. Snapped a picture and promised ourselves we'd visit again. Sent E-Mail to CO. Thanks!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC17864_ice-mine
funkygator	Found it	3/13/2011	This was my favorite of the three earth caches in the area. I was really amazed at this phenomenon.

reindeer	Found it	7/16/2017	Fund #4076 am 16. July 2017 um 13:52 U.S.A - Kanada Kentucky/Indiana - Ontario/Quebec [GER] Auf unserer Urlaubsreise konnten wir auch wieder ein paar Caches suchen und finden. Bei so mancher Naturschönheit haben wir uns sehr über einen Earth-Cache freuen können und auch von den bei uns so seltenen "virtual caches" konnten wir einige besuchen. Natürlich durften dann ganz normale Caches nicht fehlen, gesucht haben wir aber nur solche, die direkt auf dem Weg lagen und schnell gefunden werden konnten. Manchmal gab uns ein Cache auch Anlass zu einem schönen Ausflugsziel, das wir wahrscheinlich ansonsten nicht gefunden oder besucht hätten. Ein großes "Danke-Schön" an die Cache-owner für das Ausarbeiten und Pflegen der Caches. Viele Grüße an dieser Stelle aus Bayern (Deutschland). Man möge mir hier diesen Einheitslog verzeihen, wenn es zu einem Cache etwas Besonderes zu erwähnen gab, dann folgt dies in nachfolgendem fettgedruckten Absatz: [ENG] On our vacation trip we could again search and find a few caches. With so many natural beauty, we were able to look forward to an Earth cache, and we were able to visit some of the "virtual caches" we have so rare in our country. Of course we could not miss normal caches, but we only looked for those who were right on the way and could be found quickly. Sometimes a cache gave us a nice excursion destination, which otherwise we probably would not have found or visited. A great "thank you" to the cache owner for working out and maintaining the caches. Many greetings at this point from Bavaria (Germany). Let me forgive this unit log, if there was something special to mention to a cache, it is written in the following bold paragraph: [FRA] Sur nos vacances, nous pourrions aussi chercher quelques caches et les retrouver. Avec tant de beauté naturelle, nous devons être très heureux au sujet d'un cache de la Terre et aussi du si rare dans nos « caches virtuelles », nous avons pu visiter quelques-uns. Bien sûr, alors caches normales ne sont pas absents, mais nous voulions que ceux qui étaient sur le chemin et pourrait être rapidement trouvé. Parfois, un cache nous a donné aussi la cause pour une belle destination que nous aurions probablement pas autrement été trouvé ou visité. Un grand « merci » au propriétaire du cache pour la conception et la maintenance des caches. Meilleurs voeux à ce point de Bavière (Allemagne). On peut me pardonner ce Einheitslog s'il y avait un cache de mentionner quelque chose de spécial ici, ce suit au paragraphe ultérieur en gras: Answers checked by owner.WOW!!!

On a aussi fait quelques autres caches, histoire de faire au moins 100 caches dans la journée. Après avoir trouvé notre centaine de caches, Guerriers repart pour Repentigny pendant que je me dirige vers Victo... avec un gros détour par Asbestos et Weedon pour y faire 2 caches.

FamilleGB	Found it	12/13/2015	Belle journée de géocaching dans le triangle Richmond-Windsor-Asbestos pour profiter du beau temps et ramasser quelques caches. Bilan de la journée : 56 caches trouvées et trois DNF entre 8 :53 et 16 :29. Des chemins de campagnes, des cimetières et un bon ménage dans la série des hommages. Avant aujourd’hui Plaisir et cestmoi58 étaient au troisième rang dans mes stats de placeur, ils sont maintenant premier. Les caches trouvées l’ont été assez facilement pour la majorité et en bon état, pour les DNF c’est une autre histoire. Une petite pause Earth-Cache entre deux séries de rambarde. Comme toute les earth caches on apprends quelques chose durant cette visite. Je suis bien content d’avoir fait le tour des panneaux pour mieux comprendre l’historique de cette mine.

CarolynCL	Found it	9/7/2019	This was one of the earthcaches that I visited with the G18 night hike group (also referred to as NightFAP in some logs), organized by res2100. I wish I could give this one 100 FAVs because it was so memorable! I never would have been brave enough to try this alone but with the party going on inside I decided to crawl right in and join them. I enjoyed exploring the first chamber and found all the glitter on the walls fascinating. I astonished myself by deciding to attempt entry into the second chamber. This one was hard on the knees but I did it! And found the dog in there just as chill as could be about the whole thing too. Thanks for the memorable adventure!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4M7P4_cave-dweller-rockwood
MADD Momma	Found it	9/7/2019	I joined up with Ralph and a very large group on a night caching adventure during the GHAGAFAP event.

Don't judge me!..... that was a tight squeeze even for the dog...LOL Thanx for bringing us here Ralph.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4M7P4_cave-dweller-rockwood
Country_Girl78	Found it	9/7/2019	About 40 of us went on the night hike after GHAGAFAP. It was a great group. We visited several caches along the way. This was one of our targets. How lucky were we to visit with the CO. We took the readings and explored. This was my first visit and I was very excited to get in there. We got into the main chamber and had about 14 of us in there before YoungKingKole and I decided to go through to the second chamber. It was really cool and quiet in there. We explored the markings on the wall, as well as the texture and droplets. I even saw a spot where a stalactite was forming. It was pretty amazing. YoungKingKole was searching another chamber opening to see how much space there was to explore there too. There ended up being about 9 of us and a dog in the small chamber. It was a truly awesome experience. Thanks so much Res2100! Most certainly a Favourite!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4M7P4_cave-dweller-rockwood

Edina351	Found it	9/8/2018	Wow! What an adventure! This was my first time caving and I'm sure it won't be my last :) Joined the night hike group which included the CO and wasn't sure on the way if I'd enter the cave or not. Decided to check out the entrance and make a decision onscene. Enjoyed the hike to the cave entrance and hearing about its history. Once there, I thought wow that entrance is small! Decided to go for it and crawled through the entrance on my stomach using my elbows to propel myself forward. Still got quite a bit muddy despite the tarp on the ground, but seems like all the best geocaching stories end up with being dunked in water, geting extremely muddy, etc. :) Once inside we took some group photos and some ventured into the second chamber. I decided I'd save the second chamber for next year so I can have another new experience here and I would like to bring some more gear for that adventure too. A HUGE thank you to the CO for this cache- it's not everyday you get to experience something new, and something of this magnitude! Favorite point for sure. This is one of the best caches I've ever done and look forward to continuing the adventure next year. Will send answers this week.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC4M7P4_cave-dweller-rockwood
QuickasaBunny	Found it	9/8/2018	At Ghagafap with walking woody and OJOBI. Played GeoPoker, spent time with some friends laughing and grabbing some caches, earthcaches, exploring caves and ending with a night cache. OJOBI will send the answers in but we didn't take our phones in the cave with us as we were all muddy after crawling through the hole.

They had spare flashlights so we used them to make our way along the trail to the entrance way into the cave. Pictures were taking inside and posted on Facebook.

Russ and Dana	Found it	9/8/2019	Kayaking in a cave was the grand finale of our 37th anniversary celebration weekend! Brought our own kayaks and really enjoyed kayaking in a cave! We saw a blue morph butterfly at the entrance to the cave, but no bats. The water was a pearly light blue - very pretty! Though we have never kayaked the Current River, we were surprised at how fast it seemed today. It only took us 4 hrs and 5 min to float the 9 miles, and that was with one rest stop, extended cave exploration, and hitting a boulder on a class II rapid. Russ had (successfully) gone down the rapid before me and told me later how alarmed he felt when he first saw my paddle, then my seat cushion, then my koozie float by He retrieved all of them, then my hero came and retrieved me too I was banged up in a few places, but, praise the Lord, was able to get back in my kayak and paddle the rest. In the 7 years I have been kayaking, getting dumped out of it was a first for me. But it was a great day nonetheless! And we got to explore and kayak in a cave, so thanks so much for placing an Earthcache here!!

ScrapLadyS	Found it	6/9/2019	Next we started out on our hike (Spiritwolf922, Aunt Dot and I ) and at first it was easy but then we went up hill, down hill, over rocks, down dry and wet rocks, in gullies, through nettles and finally to the cave and was it beautiful. If I didn’t have Spiritwolf922 looking out for me, I would have probably ended up in the river because I was in aw. We took pictures, had a picnic, talked to some fishermen resting and headed back to the car. It was harder to get back then earlier because by then we were tired but we made it. Thanks for the wonderful site and Spiritwolf922 is sending in the answers for us.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
Aunt Dot	Found it	6/9/2019	I was excited when my niece, SpiritWolf922 invited me to go along with her and ScrapLadyS to do the Cave Spring on The Current River Earthcache along with the other earthcache and virtual nearby. In previous years I had done three D/T’s that were a 5/5. I forgot how hard it was walking on the narrow switchback trails or what seemed like to me walking in a gully. So after I had fallen a couple of times I was somewhat concerned that without phone service how we would be rescued. After walking two hours we made it to our destination, “Cave Spring on the Current” were we saw three fisherman relaxing in their canoes waiting for the fish to bite. Spiritwolf and ScrapLadyS walked closer to the cave, where I decided to stay back for safety reasons. After we ate some lunch and had taken a couple of pictures and a short rest, we started back for the car. I felt it was because of me that we were stopping often, but the other two were feeling the effects also. Asked if I would go again the answer would be yes. After all I am a geocacher. Thanks for the adventure. Giving this a favorite point. Spiritwolf922 is sending in the answers for us. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
spiritwolf922	Found it	6/9/2019	After completing the requirements for the Devil's Well virtual and earthcache at the trailhead, we read the informational sign about the trail to the Cave Spring. I took a photo of the map for reference since I didn't have cell service - although I had downloaded my cache list with full data prior to leaving St. Louis in the morning - just in case we had to navigate the old fashioned way if technology failed. The trail itself is a 4.5-mile loop with a couple of off-shoots, one leading to the cave and the other to the river. The trail is a narrow footpath, more a well-trodden, glorified deer trail, than what I might consider a 'trail', but this is a National Park natural area, so you won't find that mulch-covered, wide walkway here. While the CO noted that the hike is a lesser DT than the paddling, I find that at my age (and the ages of my companions) would disagree for the 'easier' DT from hiking. My group, consisting of myself, Aunt Dot and ScrapLadyS, range between 50-75, and we fully agree that our experience warranted the 5/5 DT over land. Along the way, we encountered four trees fallen over the trail; countless large, embedded rocks in the trail; very slippery, damp natural rock 'stairs'; and the pièce de résistance: about 400 feet of stinging nettle between us and the beach near the cave. We all had on long pants, so it shouldn't have been an issue, but the pants I was wearing were no match for the nettles; the sting penetrated the thin material on the way in and on the way out. Fortunately, Aunt Dot was carrying hand sanitizer, which took care of the sting once applied to the affected areas. We heard voices ahead while we were still about 1/10th of a mile away, and when we got to the beach, we saw their owners: three fishermen in canoes were resting in the shade of the cove just off the river's current. They greeted us and offered us beers, but we politely declined, citing our need to stay hydrated with the water we'd brought, so we could make the journey back. We chatted with them for a while as we made our observations at the cave and took photos. We then took a break to eat the lunch we'd brought along in our packs, then went back to the cave to take a couple more photos and bid the canoeists good journey, as they were setting off at the same time. Having rested up a little, we decided it was time to start back up the trail to the car. We'd taken it slow and steady to get to the cave and knew that it would likely be the same on the way back. It had taken a little over two hours to walk in and it was about the same... maybe a little longer... on the way back. We stopped several times on the way back, mostly leaning against trees for a break, because there are precious few places to sit. One of the best places is an area with large boulders next to the path, which kind of look like they were carved into low-backed chairs. We stopped here the longest on the return trip. The round trip to the cave was long and arduous for us, but I believe we all felt it was worth the 4.5 hour hike to have the opportunity to see this beautiful area. I'm not sure I'm up for another 5/5 cache any time soon, but I'm giving this one a well-deserved favorite point.

LifeIsGuud	Found it	5/2/2018	The wifey dropped me and my canoe off at Akers Ferry and I paddled down to Round Springs in 6 hours and stopping here was one of the highlights of the canoe trip. It was fun to explore the cave area on foot and then by boat. Paddled in as far as I could go before turning around and heading back down river. Thanks for the cache, a great experience. The only living beings I saw today were swallows and flowers. TFTC	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
HikingSeal	Found it	4/18/2018	Had a nice hike up to the cave from Devils Well. It isn't until I'm now logging this that I understand why it's a 5 terrain cache. We got there and I scramble over to the cave mouth to check out what might be in the water. I was a little bummed not to come up with anything. Cache is still a nice way to mark our visit here.

OCCD	Found it	4/11/2018	Two months ago I thought about taking two days off to add Iowa to my cache statistics. The plan was threefold; get a new state, work on some D/T grid fillers, and hit 1000 Mystery finds. One state quickly became two states. Then a cacher mentioned this year's MOGA at a Meet n' Eat event. MOGA's not to far from Iowa. I added Nebraska to the plan. It's funny how one thing morphed into something else. Then I notice that I've never found more than four states in one day, even though I've driven through more than four states in a day. I started working on how to get five different types of caches in five different states in one day. Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa in one day. That's doable. Just when I thought I had a plan coming together I discover an EarthCache in Missouri. You might be asking yourself why are you looking for caches in Missouri when you're going to Iowa and Nebraska? Because I'm easily distracted. I noticed an EarthCache that sounded interesting and decided I wanted to add it to my trip. I enjoy EarthCaches, and I always learn something new by doing one. It's a science lesson that often includes a little mathematics. EarthCaches have taken me to buildings, fountains, cemeteries, rock formations, marshes, wetlands, vernal ponds, beaches, moraines, an alvar, sink holes, erratics, glacial grooves, artesian wells, waterfalls, confluences, gaging stations, a fault line, and the Continental Divide. When I was a child I wanted to be like John Francis Smith. Ranger Smith had the ultimate dream job; the opportunity to be outside and be a steward for the park. I'd be lying if I didn't say I secretly rooted for Yogi Bear in his quest for a pic-a-nic basket too. Who am I kidding I still watch cartoons and enjoy being outside. I think I read that Geocachers make up 0.04% of the total world population, then factoring in those that canoe or hike a distance for an EarthCache that percentage drops even lower putting me into a small group of individuals that found this place. A chance to be outside away from the hustle and bustle of normal day life, and discover a new area of the country is a prize in itself. My extended family and friends that have no clue what geocaching is and are mildly surprised by how I stumble across Old Chestnuts of Americana in my travels. Today's travels will add Missouri to my EarthCache finds that already include Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New York, Mississippi, Virginia, Texas, South & North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennesse, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. My geocaching plans change like the wind, but one thing I've always tried to do is grab an EarthCache if time permits.  Granted, with over 20,000 active EarthCaches around the world, and averaging just 24 finds a year I needn't worry about running out of one's to grab. Thanks for keeping this cache going. As always, answers to follow shortly. TFTC.

Kymma924	Found it	10/7/2017	I wanted to see this anyway, and I needed an earthcache today. Double win. ^_^ It was kind of drizzly, but it was my only chance before heading home. So I made the hike. I ended up going all the way around, instead of finding the slightly shorter route. It was a nice hike, though. Just hard enough that it was challenging, but not too steep or long that it wasn't fun. Should have brought water and a buddy for basic hiking safety, but didn't come with anyone and forgot about water. XD In any case, it worked out fine. The cave/spring was really cool to see.

Giardia-	Found it	8/13/2017	Found this cache with Geoyakr while kayaking the river. I've actually visited this location several times in the past (the first around 1979).

GeoYakr	Found it	8/12/2017	Visiting from Memphis TN. Awesome ec. Great kayak trail. fellow Geocacher Giardia and I made a trip up to paddle the river fro Akers to Pulltite. WE also visited the well, but had to do the EC by kayak to enjoy the 5/5/ rating. This is a milestone cache for me SL# 1700	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
GeoWench78	Found it	7/31/2017	Found with AF BEE while caching on a camping weekend. He sent in our answer. Long pants are a must -- even in late July. We know this because we wore shorts!

Thanks for placing this cache.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
AF BEE	Found it	7/31/2017	OCW GeoWench78 on our way home after camping at Echo Bluff State Park last night...got an early start (0745)...so it wasn't too hot, just had to deal with the spiders, occasional PI, and some stinging nettles...recommend long pants for this hike as the vegetation is encroaching on the trail this time of year. The neat cave was certainly worth the 4 mile round trip (we didn't do the longer half of the loop)...TFTC!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

cjhoffy	Found it	6/26/2017	My family came to the area for a canoe trip on the Current River. We stayed at Montauk Resort. I brought a flashlight so we could get a good look inside. That was fun going into a cave from a canoe. There were a lot of swallows nesting inside, but we didn't notice any other wildlife. cjhoffy from Lenexa, KS 11:58:00 AM	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

chiquita's bunch	Found it	5/22/2017	Sorry for the late posting, life got in the way of geocaching again. We used to float the Current River with my husband's brother every summer, since it's been over a decade we figured it was time to revisit. Luckily we called beforehand and found out there had been record flooding a few weeks earlier but that things were in the process of getting back to normal. We weren't sure what we were going to find when we arrived at Pulltite campground but the crews had done an awesome job cleaning up, you would never have guessed that 10-15 feet of water had recently been covering our campsite. It had only reopened 2 days earlier so there were very few other campers making for a quiet & delightful time. The first day Carr's (great people, big shout out to driver Tom) canoe rental picked us up at our tent and drove us to Akers Ferry and then we floated back to our campsite. It was really incredible seeing all the downed trees along the banks and the debris left high in the trees. Once again, the park service had done an amazing job clearing the river of obstacles, there was only one spot that was a bit tricky because of a fallen sycamore. We only saw two other kayakers the entire time we were on the river, unfortunately they were right in front of us as we approached Cave Spring so we pulled over to the opposite bank and waited for them to finish exploring. After they paddled off we headed in, even though we've been here a few times before it's always super cool (in more ways than one). Thanks lonestarkayaker for setting up this earthcache, definitely deserving of a huge favorite vote.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river
GZBound	Found it	1/24/2017	Hiked down to the cave today from Devil's well. I wasn't sure how far in you could get by foot, but we got all the way to the back of the cave easily. Such a beautiful experience. I definitely plan on returning in the future when it's warmer to explore this by water. Stayed at the new lodge in the new Echo Bluffs state park. Have found a new gem in the heart of Missouri. Definitely a favorite.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

Hadn't been on this section of the river in over 10 plus years. Had a wonderful time. It was a humid, overcast day and we had fog rolling off the river for much of our float, including the area near the cave. That was a fun aspect. Didn't bring my camera on the river, so no pictures. Ken emailed the answers for both of us. Thanks for the fun EarthCache!	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

myotis	Found it	7/15/2015	Since this is NOT a 5/5 by any stretch of the imagination, I thought about not logging it. Back in the day, a 5/5 was really hard, not really easy like this one. I remember the 5/5 I set up back in the day, it took 2 days and instead of having to guess how tall something was (that's a 5 difficulty??? it is a 1 difficulty) you had to do a bunch of stuff along the 18 mile hike. But o well, the spring was a really flowing (first time I ever saw it with brown water coming out of it. So it was really hard to get back into the cave. I think an accurate rating for this cache would be 2/1.	https:/www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC22Y58_cave-spring-on-the-current-river

canoecolt	Found it	3/8/2015	Third time here and the Cave although it is not very deep never fails to attract all the canoeists like a magnet. Always fascinating ... the cave itself, the blue color of the spring water, the critters along the way and just learning about the whole formation of the spring caves is of interest.

Jaty5	Found it	2/7/2015	With my mom and dad (AstroD) on our yearly trek to the Florida Keys. Continuing our walk along the trails. What should have taken a short amount of time to walk, took forever as mom and dad kept stopping to look and photograph all the birds they kept coming across along the way. After looking at the blue hole, mom made the quick find on this one before heading off further down the trail. Covered it up better than we found it.

But I got even luckier because on my way the owner himself accompanied me and my ‘muggle friend’. Dannie, thank you so much for showing me around I really had a good time.

AR RStanton	Found it	10/2/2014	My wife and I took off for a few days to head over to the Mammoth Cave area for a few days. We cached both ways and while we were there. I managed to pick up 11 virtuals, 7 Earthcaches, my first and only webcam, a D5 puzzle and many other caches at interesting spots in 4 different states, including 2 that I had not cached in before. We enjoyed seeing all the places that we went, and appreciate all the COs that placed these caches, we had a great trip and geocaching was a big part of that.

Flagg2007	Found it	8/30/2013	We will call this our mini vacation day. We picked today to go to Mammoth Cave. Plus get a few caches on the way. Today was not a bad but it did get a little warm today. One of the spots we stopped at was a cave in Bowling Green. We did not get to go to that cave but we did some of the caches on their Greenway. We were able to get all the caches that I had marked too which was a nice change of pace. Most of the time when we go out of town there tend to be a lot of DNFs or they are very hard to find. After do a nice tour of BG we headed to Mammoth Cave. Thanks for all the good caches.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1N7KG_caching-in-the-cave-the-blue-hole-2

johnniemikel	Found it	5/19/2013	SO cool! This was actually my first geocache adventure. Just like the hint says, it was behind a tree, and sorta close to a rock. It was a screw lid, camo jar. Inside was a small, "Noah's Ark" flipbook -- used as a logbook. I wrote "John M." and the date. The last person there was on 5-14-13. As far as trading goes, there is only one prize in a small plastic baggie. I traded an 1891 Dominican Republic coin for a small hair-dryer charm. It was totally worth the visit; being my first geocache, and all. There were spiders, though. I took lots of photos.

Over_The_Hill_Gang	Found it	9/18/2016	We have wanted to do this cache for a loonnggggg time and yesterday while visiting our oldest grandson at college, we three, the young and agile Bill, the older and learned husband Bill, and me, somewhat shorter but always enthusiastic Gram, found and wound our way through steep stone stairs, rock crevices and numerous caves to find it. We knew it was archived, but thought we would give it a try anyway . Others have signed it recently also...it needs someone to adopt it that lives in the area! So much history in a beautiful area!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

a2arnold	Write note	8/4/2014	We agree with the previous poster, this was a great cache and shouldn't have been archived. Too bad someone didn't adopt it since the owner wouldn't respond. We hope this can be unarchived or someone will reincarnate this one.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
tedw	Write note	8/4/2014	This cache was wrongfully archived I drove 155 miles to find it exactly the way it was a year ago, the block with the cords is safe and sound 8 feet up on the ledge where it belongs. Im very disipointed to see this amazing cache archived. Just because 1 or 2 people cant find something does not mean its not there. This is and always be my number one favorite cache. The cachers that were last to dnf this should have contacted someone who had last found it for info before calling for an archive..... shame that future cachers will miss out on a cache like this.

sclaws	Didn't find it	11/3/2013	Both of us searched the cave heavily but came up with nothing to give us the coordinates to the next step. We had watched kids enter the crevice previously but never realized how big it was inside.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
RN escape	Didn't find it	11/3/2013	Sure think we found the cave which was to have the coords to the final, Nascarterry gave me 2 large flashlights and told me not to get stuck!! Wasn't too bad, looked up, down, around, back and forth, picked up every rock I could, checked each shelf and crack - but no luck with finding coords… Met other hikers before we went in and they hung around until I came out - the kids were very interested in the cave and their dad was took them in… Disapppointed couldn't find the cache, but had a good time, and will definitely, return again..Thanks for the adventure anyway.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
rushrutter	Didn't find it	10/22/2013	After the long hike doing the MHT loop, we decided we had enough time to give this interesting cache a try. What a cool spot especially as it was getting close to sunset! We managed to get to the cave but after two attempts of checking out each nook and cranny and every rock that moved, I could not spot the coords at WP1. We will be back.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
p1tax	Didn't find it	9/1/2013	Found the first cave but didn't see a brick or stone with any coords on it. Borrowed another hikers flashlight and searched the entire cove thoroughly. Still enjoyed the area and the cool cave air on a humid day.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
happyinVA	Didn't find it	8/11/2013	hmmmm... sent the kids into the first cave but they were unable to locate the brick or a rock with the coordinates. Hopefully they just missed it, I guess I should have tried to squeeze in. We'll go back after we see some finds.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

Creigh-cacher	Found it	7/12/2013	This Cach was a lot of fun, and this area was awesome, just started working down the road, I'll defiantly be back to Rime Rock! Was just reading the previous logs, looks like I lucked out as the cach was replaced only a few days ago, I have to laugh too because I almost made the same mistake a2arnold did nearly simmyed down into the wrong cave, I was alone and was to scared of getting stuck otherwise I would have, then I found the real cave with the geocach but my GPS was taking me in circles for a while lol.

a2arnold	Write note	7/11/2013	After multiple DNFs (including us), we thought something should be done to get this great cache in service again. So we consulted with a previous finder and replaced the brick (tan colored fire brick now) and added a fake stone both with the coords for stage 2. We found stage 2 and the cache is in good shape. So the cache is now up and ready to go. Have fun!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
a2arnold	Found it	7/11/2013	A huge thank you to the previous finders who responded to our distress call/email last night. After reviewing hints & exchanging photos, we were fairly certain that our search yesterday had been thorough enough to have turned up the brick with the coords for stage 2. We assume it is gone. A bit bizarre that it was hauled out while empty water bottles, tea lights, etc. were left behind, but odd things happen. The stage 2 coordinates ended up in our possession, so today we stopped at a home improvement center & bought a sharpy & fireplace brick (light tan in color). We arrived back at GZ, thoroughly searched the inner cave again for about 45 min. & then left the replacement for the benefit of the next cachers. This multi is way too awesome to allow it to die. We next set out to make the final grab. The forest, rocks & weather were wonderful, but Mrs. a2a (who is used to Florida's flat land) was not as fond of the tilted topography while bushwacking. Our GPSr was slow in updating & we ended up having to circle back around to the proper rocky prominence for the final. Mr. a2arnold shimmied into the wrong cave first, but his 2nd choice was the proper one & we easily made the find. WaHooo! This was a wonderful adventure and we'd give it multiple favorite points if we could. SL but accidentally dated it 7/12/13 (hey, we're on vacation so who's keeping track?!), TNLN, things were a bit musty, but in good shape! TFTMC! :-)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
a2arnold	Didn't find it	7/10/2013	This multi was high on our to do-list while camping in the area. We gathered supplies this morning (flashlights - check, extra betteries - check, old clothes - check, bike helmets - check), then headed to the beautiful wooded, rocky overlook. Quite a few muggles were exploring the area too. Amazing vistas. We walked down the stony stairs, followed the proper path & arrived at the entrance to the 1st cave. Sucked in our guts & ventured in. Mrs. a2a made it through the 1st narrow hallway, but waited outside the last inner, tight opening to the tea-light decorated cave. Mr. a2a squeeeezzzeeedd in & searched diligently there, while the Mrs. examined rocky walls, nooks & crannies around her. After a significant amount of time (1 hour or so), no sign of the final's coords turned up. We did spot a surprising number of spiders. We left the cave & hiked about a bit, trying to find any likely spots for the 2nd cave, but are stumped. D'oh. Double darn & scratching our heads over what to do now. We're sending out an SOS begging for a hint from previous finders. No joy for us today.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

daveandsilvia	Didn't find it	10/13/2012	Looked in the first cave for about 30 minutes with no luck. This a heavily visited area and I suspect it has been muggled, especially since the last two logs were also unable to find it.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

OLIVERAAAA	Found it	7/19/2012	WE MADE IT! OMG I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN. We couldn't get the co-ordinates from the first part of the cache...did an extensive google search and found them online. Found our way to the second portion but the cache wasn't where it was listed as being in the "hint". We found it deep deep down in a hole at the very back of the one section. Hubby slithered in on his stomach to recover it. We placed it back closer to where we thought it was supposed to be, based on the descriptions. There are no travel bugs in this box, in fact it was mostly garbage on the box. We restocked it with some goodies and headed on our way. What an amazing place. The highlight for the kids was definitely the air-conditioning coming out of the walls around Rim Rock. Thanks for the experience. It was fantastic!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

rclizmom	Found it	5/27/2012	We caught the shuttle bus up from the Rimrock Bash and made our way down the narrow stairs and around the big rocks to the cave entrance. Boy, did the cold air coming out of there feel good! I stayed outside near the entrance to guard all the things hubby had to leave behind in order to squeeze into the cave. He and Geolov made their way in and got the coordinates, then we all headed off to the final. Hubby's been wanting to do this one for a long time, and he wasn't disappointed--it was a lot of fun for all of us. But now we're determined to go on diets.....TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
pa kilts	Found it	5/20/2012	Twelve of us set out to find the first stage. Then only half of us continued on to stage two. We knew the terrain was difficult so the three little ones(ages 4, 1 and 0) headed back with their moms and nana. The rest of us went on and snagged stage two and then bushwacked back to the Rimrock picnic area. What a great cache to get us excited about Geowoodstock next weekend. Thanks for the hide.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

tyro-n-www	Found it	5/17/2012	This cache has been at the top of my to-do list for a long time and since we needed a cache today to fill in a date on our statistics calendar, today was the day. Set out mid morning in the vacation-queen family truckster for Rimrock and as hoped, the parking lot was empty and there was not a soul around. Pretty chilly morning but an absolutely clear and beautiful sunny day. The water in the reservoir was a gorgeous shade of blue from the overlooks and there were flowers starting to bloom on some of the laurel out near the overlooks. After bumbling around a bit to find a way down to the base of the rocks we found cave #1. I stripped down to a T-Shirt and jeans, put on my headlamp and some old work-gloves and headed into the cave followed somewhat reluctantly by www. I will have to give her credit though because she made it at least 6 feet into the cave before she decided that she had had enough spelunking for one day. Anyways, I found and negotiated the passage into the "second room" and found the coordinates near the very end. It was a pretty tight squeeze. getting in and out of there but I'm 65, 6 ft tall and 158#s and I had no real trouble but your definitely going to get your clothes a little dirty. Don't even think of trying it with a daypack on. Didn't have a helmet on and at one particular point I wish I had been wearing one as the rock is very hard! ( even a bike helmet would have sufficed). Did a little CITO on the way out. ( beer cans ) There were a bunch of tea lights set up on the walls of both sides of the second room. Obviously somebody has something planned for in there in the near future. After exiting www and I bushwacked to the second cave, made the find and then bushwacked straight up the hill ( as straight as the boulders and mountain laurel would allow ) to the Rimrock road, turned left and walked the road back to the truckster. This one is a must for any geo-nut out there. It definitely gets a favorite from me. As for www, maybe not so much. TNLNSL, Thanks for the absolutely great cache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

Rockton Raiders	Found it	5/5/2012	What a way to elebrate Cinco de Mayo by caching. We arrived at the first stage to find another group of cachers who needed the help of our GPS' since the gps on their cell phone wouldn't work so the guys went into the cave and with the help of a muggle, located the coords for the final and off we went! Found the final with the help of the hint and the limberness of the other caching party. This cache will get a favorite point from us. Thanks for taking us to such an interesting area. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
GEOCATZ!	Found it	5/5/2012	As we arrived at the first stage we found a group of people just hanging out. Apparently they had used a cellphone to find the first stage but didn't know how to enter the coords for the second stage and they were waiting for some help. There was also another man there who had been in the cave before and said he'd look for the coords for us. So the guys went in with him and came back out with the coords. Cool!! So off we went - with the other group of cachers - to the final. We enjoyed the hike over to GZ and it wasn't long before we had the cache in hand. Thanks for the fun adventure!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

haloedversionls	Write note	3/10/2012	Maintenance visit today. Stage one is in place and legible. The stage one cave is full of cool ice formations. The gates are closed, so we had to hike the .8-mile to the rocks. The final is in place and in fine condition. Looks like some animal is using the cave as a winter den, but the only signs we saw was scat. I added some swag to the cache for future finders. Happy Caching!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
Knagis	Found it	12/4/2011	Main objective for the weekend trip. And it was sure worth it! As usual I didn't read the description before so we ventured around the GZ on many different elevations, doing crazy stunts but not finding the correct cave. After I read the description the correct cave appeared out of nowhere right in front of us. Still it took us some time to locate the coordinates as I did not think we should look there... Once the coordinates were found it was a quick walk and quick find at the final. TFTC! FTW yoPCix	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

moxychiq	Found it	9/3/2011	Wow! What an awesome cache! I was in the area with carawannababes and PurpleHawks for a day of caching. We were working our way from cache to cache when this one came up as very nearby. It didn't take long for us to decide that we had to go for it! I'm so glad that we did! We had lots of muggle company at stage 1, but it was c-babes who eventually made the find. Off we went to stage 2. We had a nice walk, even though it was pretty hot out (I missed the natural air conditionong we had at stage 1!). We got to the second cave and got down to searching. I investigated one spot and couldn't believe my eyes...was it? Could it be? IT WAS!!! I brought the container out into the light so that we could investigate the contents and happily sign the log. Thank you so much for the awesome adventure and a very memorable smiley!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

Thanks for an amazing cache and a big smiley	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
WHAP	Found it	8/26/2011	My husband gets most of the credit for this find. He did the wriggling and squirming to find part one. I didn't trust my bum hip to hold up while getting in there. I was thinking that having my ultra-skinny niece with us would have been a great help today! Part two was relatively easy. GPS was bouncing around like crazy; thanks to the description on the cache page and in previous logs we knew we had the right place. Little more scrambling over the rocks and we had the cache. Definitely an epic adventure for us.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

tbone57	Found it	7/22/2011	Great cache in a neat area. Unfortunately there was a ton of trash at the first cave. Left matches and trioxane firestarter. Took keychain and garbage bag, then took the garbage bag back to first cave and policed the area. TFTC !	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
RimRockRaptor	Found it	7/20/2011	Good find. We could not find the firt part on the first try (did not have a flashlight) so we had to come back a second time. If you are not prepared you will not find the cache. Took a bit of climbing and twisting around to get through the skinny opening. The second part took a bit of hiking but once we got to the "table" it was not to hard to find the final cache. This was my 2nd find and now I am hooked.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
TazD	Found it	7/4/2011	This was my second visit to this cache and I was finally able to claim the find. I was camping across the river from here for the GeoWoodstock event. I couple of days ago I attempted this one with Peppermill 6-Pack, OCIFI and ChileHead. We mostly failed on our attempt. We did manage to locate the entrance and enjoyed exploring some of the cave. The cool air on this hot day felt really nice, but we didn't come up with any coordinates. With guests on their way we headed off to our campsite for the evening. I stopped by again with my daughter, Frogize, on our way out of town today to give it one more shot. She really enjoyed exploring the cave and surrounding area. Before long we were on our way in search of the final which is in another pretty cool spot. After adding our names to the log book we hurried back to the parking area. Thanks for showing us some great spots.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
JFlow	Found it	7/4/2011	After I got home last night, I looked through the logs and photos (my GPSr didn't have the cache description) from other cachers and knew that I had to get back out and find this one. A couple of the photos showed the second stage "cave" and guess what, I was right next to it yesterday but didn't find a way to climb up in it. So, I was the only person in the whole area at 8:00 am this morning. Went to the stage one cave and managed to fit myself in the first room, turned around and saw the "crack" for the second room, but could not fit through there at all. No wonder nobody I was with yesterday found the coordinates for the second stage, they were looking in the first room. I decided to give the second stage a try anyway by following the track on my GPSr. I ended up falling off a five foot high boulder face first, only injuring my right middle finger and getting scratches on my neck and left arm. I thought that I broke my finger, but I wasn't going to let my injuries stop me, so I managed to get to the entrances to the second stage "caves". It wasn't three caves, but a boulder tunnel made from three boulders and a cave to each side. I checked the tunnel, nothing. I check the cave where I climbed up at and guess what, I FOUND THE CACHE!!! The lesson I learned from this is don't rush, take your time and keep looking at your surroundings for possible dangers. My finger isn't broken, but it sure is a darker shade of purple and spreading. Plenty of ice, finger splint and it should be fine in a few weeks (I hope). The cache was nice, but I enjoyed the adventure more (falling and all). TFTC! TFTA!!!

coolhipwithit	Didn't find it	7/3/2011	OMG - I wanted this one soooooooo bad!!! I didn't even know of it until Big Mama came down the steps to underneath the 'rimrock' and asked me if I was going for the 4-star 'cave' hide. I said 'What cave hide? Heck yeah, I'll search for it' . . . So, she reads off the write-up while I went IN where we thought the first clue was. I couldn't find anything and I'm pretty sure I was in the right cave?!?! I guess I wasn't :-( Darn it. I even came back the next day to try again - NOTHING - again!!! I hate when this happens. I really wanted to find this one. OH well, it was fun scrambling around in the cave(s) and all around under the cliffs. It's really beautiful here!!!

trowel32	Found it	7/3/2011	I tried this cache nearly 5 years ago on my first (reconnaissance) visit to Allegheny http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=74ddc7bd-fe20-4cfd-b9f9-183c70a49200 I could not find Stage 1 then, although I apparently eventually did make my way to the end of the proper corridor, but now as I read the old logs, I see Stage 1 actually WAS missing when I was there. I had trouble understanding the hint back then which caused me to spend a lot of time looking in the completely wrong area (the wide room to the right when you walk straight back). I noticed there are logs from the CO that describe pretty well where to go, but they are really old and I doubt most people read through all the ancient logs. Maybe the hint should be changed and just explain that it is the tight corridor to the left at the end of the first "main" corridor. It seems like there are a lot of DNFs just because people can't figure out where to go, since there is no GPS reception in a cave. I made last minute plans to head up to GWIX this year and this cache was high on my priority list. I had been back here many times since 2006, but mostly had AGT on my agenda so I never got back to this one. Now that I'm done with the AGT I can concentrate on the other really awesome caches in the area. I was psyched to see that maintainence was done on this cache and that I might be able to find it. I saw that a few people had found the final using the force, and I brought a picture from the gallery along just in case I needed to do that, but now that I have been to the final, I'm pretty suprised that anyone was able to just find it like that. It seemed pretty far out there and not all that obvious to just stumble upon . I was extremely late to the Kinzua Beach Bash event but ran into a few northern NJ and New York cachers I knew, and The Leprechauns from the Pittsburgh area who I just met, and we all teamed up to find this one. I left my car at the beach and grabbed a ride up with The Leprechauns so I could hike the trail back down to the beach afterwards. Even though it had been many years since my last visit I knew where to turn after we descended the stairs. Such a cool area! We got to the cave entrance and I was thrilled to feel the cold air condtioner- like air emanating from it since I was sweating like a beast Very nice. I would like to think the cave shrunk, but I guess I have gained weight since my last visit, as it definitely seemed like a tighter squeeze than I remembered. Once we all squished in there I was pretty sure where we needed to go. The Leprechauns led the way into the tighter chamber, and he found Stage 1 quickly but I felt the need to squeeze in there to check it out anyway. I did hit my head on the rock at some point so its probably not a bad idea to wear some sort of caving helmet or bike helmet, but it was okay. We gathered the needed numbers and were off after collecting headlamps and flashlights that some of the team lent to a few kids so they could check out the cave. The hike to the second cave was a little tricky with some bushwacking and uneven ground but eventually we ended up sort of on a trail. I recognized the cave from the gallery photos and thought the side rooms would be off the main overhang so a bunch of us climbed up. We soon realized that was wrong and headed back down but The Leprechauns continued to do a very thorough analysis of the upper area just in case Brian went in to the first side room/chamber we found after slithering past a large boulder and found the cache very quickly. We all signed in and took some pictures and of course I had to put it back so I could check out the room. There was some weird stuff/pellets on the floor that looked like it came from a deer, but maybe an oppossum or racoon or something...I'm not sure. Thanks for the hide in this fantastic area...glad it was still around after so many years have passed	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
skigirl	Found it	7/3/2011	Found it with BrianSnat, HalleyCat, Edgrac, etc.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
The Leprechauns	Found it	7/3/2011	After the North Country Trail event, I joined up with a group of New Jersey/New York geocachers to seek out this challenging multicache. I'd been in the area for GeoWoodstock since Friday afternoon, but this was the first cache I sought. I was having too much fun socializing at the many events! My contributions to this group effort included being one of the people skinny enough to find stage one, helping to choose the best route for bushwacking back and forth between the stages, and ruling out the main section of the second cave as a possible hiding place. I was actually standing twenty feet above the cache when the rest of the group found it. Your fine multicache has been on my "To Do" list for a long time. Thank you for introducing me to this very cool area with a well-constructed adventure. This cache goes straight onto my "Favorites" list.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
jrsyjane	Didn't find it	7/3/2011	Attempted with Aroxx & Raritan after the beach event nearby, but no luck. Incredibly disappointed we didn't hook up with one of the successful groups, but we did still have a great time exploring the area. Very scenic!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
Julz81	Found it	7/3/2011	Group of friends and 7 kids, took a while but we found it!! Great hide!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
leftyfb	Didn't find it	7/3/2011	This has to be one of our favorite caches of all time and certainly our favorite DNF. We had someone with us who has been trying this cache for a while and we think he might have been confused about the caves a bit so it might have been throwing us off. I could be wrong. Regardless, the caves were completely awesome and so much fun to just explore and marvel at the construction of all the staircases. Thanks for bringing us to this spot even though we weren't able to find any of the stages.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
cshumac	Found it	7/3/2011	Great hike with the kids. Had a hard time with the first part, but eventually found it and went hiking to the second part.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
HowerPower	Found it	7/3/2011	We had a friend tells us about this cache. She knew we would be in the area for GW9 and told us we better try it. So we gathered up Cerebus, CJ, WT, O'Henry, and DRR. We all made it to the first stage, but O'Henry is quite the little explorer so WT decided to play it safe and take him back to the car. While the ladies sat outside the men went in for the first stage. After a short time DRR and Mr. HP emereged. Where is Cerebus? They don't know so our search began for him. We made our way back to the top all the while yelling his name. We asked other people if they saw him. Thank goodness CJ headed back to the truck and found him there. So now that the gang was all intact we headed to the final. Quite the bushwhack for us, but we finally arrived. Mr. HP was on a roll and spotted the container soon after we arrived. Awesome cache! The area is amazing! It would be neat to explore here on a weekday when the area is not so crowded. This was an adventure we won't soon forget. Sure glad it has been kept active. TFTC!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
cshumac17	Found it	7/3/2011	We took the round about way to get to the main cache, but we eventually found it with some VERY tired kids. Great cache. Loved this area since I was child.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
raritan	Didn't find it	7/3/2011	There was a whole bunch of people, mostly cachers, around GZ. We enjoyed the overlook, the steps, and the cool air flowing out of the cave. Aroxx squeezed in and spend a good time looking for the brick, but to no avail (reading the logs now, he might not have gone in far enough, but there were two other guys in there with him, and we're not too crazy about small spaces.) Oh well, we should have waited for trowel32 and her gang who were more successful. We will be back, had a lot of fun exploring the area. TFTH	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
Edgrac	Found it	7/3/2011	What an awesome place. While attending GeoWoodstock 9 event and the Kinzua beach event a group from the north Jersey cachers got together for this one. We dont regret the decision. This one became one of my favorites. TFTH and the awesome adventure.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
hallycat	Found it	7/3/2011	2212: After an emergency replacement tire at Walmart I made it back to Kinzua beach just in time to hook up with a gang of pals from NJ. And one from PA too. Trowel32 was back to rectify a DNF, and you don't get in the way of Laura on a mission. There were some pretty scary steps to go down and I wasn't thrilled at the prospect of going back up them. Anyway the first cave was found shortly and people started going in. Realizing they couldn't get through with their packs on they started handing them out. It was finally my turn and as I got to the larger part of the cave, Olga was struck with claustrophobia and I had to go out to let her back out too. Finally went back in and had a look around, so nice and cool in there! Meanwhile the others had found part one and gotten the coordinates to part two so once we retrieved all our gear and the headlamps and flashlight that Skigirl and I lent to some young lads, off we went. Another fairly short walk. Getting up wasn't easy nor was getting down! The Ed part of Edgrac was kind enough to toss over the log to sign. This is way better then a park and grab let me tell you and it's what makes caching so much fun. Then the "boys" had a little session of who can get the dirtiest. Briansnat one, to nobody's surprise. TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
Delaware River Rat	Found it	7/3/2011	Found with HowerPower, cerberus1, and CJ AKA Carly. We thought we could try this with O'Henry, but a two year old likes exploring. So, WT took him to the explorer for some AC and a nap (BTW--he didn't). Since WT writes all my logs, she doesn't know what really happened play by play until the group returns to the parking lot with smiles on their faces. All WT knows is that Rich of HP and DRR were looking deep in the caves together when HP finds part one. DRR asks HP if he found it. Simultaneously, HP verbally lies and shows the coords on his hand to DRR. Off to part two. DRR took one cave, HP took another with HP coming up with the find. That is all I know... WT PS--She is super jealous that she missed this one :(	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
briansnat	Found it	7/3/2011	Skigirl and I went to the Kinzua Beach Geobash where we ran into some other NJ cachers, including Trowel32 who mentioned that she was going to try this cache, as she had DNFed it her last time here. It sounded like my kind of cache so we scraped together a group of cacher and headed to ground zero. The steep staircase carved into the side of the cliff was an outstanding introduction to the cache. It was a unique experience in and of itself. Soon we found ourselves at GZ. I followed Trowel32 and Leprechauns into the first cave. Being slightly rotund it was a tight fit for me. We reached what we thought was a dead end and couldn't find anything. It was then that Trowel pointed out another possible location. She and Leprechauns were able to fit through and I decided to stay behind and heard them declare that they found the first stage. Most of the rest of our group (Edgrac, HallyCat, etc.) had filed in behind me and it was getting pretty crowded in there. I'm claustrophobic to begin with so I was happy to get back outside. It was then off to the final stage. It was a fairly easy bushwhack aided by a faint but followable trail to the final. We explored the main opening and came up empty. Then Trowel read the page out loud and we realized we were looking in the wrong place. I made my way over to what I thought would be the likely opening and crawled inside. Sure enough, there was the cache. Discovering places such as this is exactly why I geocache. This is definitely one of my all time favorites. Thank you so much for bringing me here.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
JFlow	Didn't find it	7/3/2011	Spent over four hours with different groups of people trying to find the first stage. We found the first stage (I didn't fit in the cave), but nobody found the coordinates for the second stage. Was given coordinates by someone who was also given the coordinates. I went out there but it didn't look like the cache would be there, so I deleted the coordinates. I want to find this one. Never tried anything like this before.

CJ (part of Cerberus1)	Found it	7/3/2011	Was at a nearby event. Met up with some cachers that wanted to do this one and asked us to go with them. Had a little trouble finding GZ for stage one, but HowerPower and Delaware River Rat prevailed. When HowerPower and DRR came out of the cave, they asked "where's Cerberus". After searching a little while found him at the truck. He was in another cave and couldn't find us. Ok on to the final. Managed to make quick time of this one. Thanks for the fun.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
cerberus1	Found it	7/3/2011	1415- Met HowerPower,Walnut-Tripper and Delaware River Rat at the Kinzua beach GeoBash. They were heading here after and knowing we like this type, asked if we wanted to play... Hit first stage and bounce led us to many possibles. Everyone seemed to find their own tunnel to explore. I got hung up in one and after finally getting my fat can out, realized everyone forgot about me and were headed to the next (HP spotted the coords.) SUPPOSEDLY, everyone suddenly realized I wasn't there any longer and CJ spotted me to (again) tag along. All seemed to have a different avenue to access GZ, but HP & DWR's pick was easiest. TNLNSL. Awesome area ! If there weren't so many people picnicking, we'd have stayed a bit and explored some more. Thanks for the fun !	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
Peppermill 6-Pack	Didn't find it	7/2/2011	Had heard about this cache when people were talking about Geowoodstockarea caches, and decided to give it a go with OCIFI, Chilehead and TazD. Knew it was supposed to be replaced sometime this weekend, but since we didn't have cel/internet reception at our campsite over at Dew Drop, couldn't check the notes to see if it had been yet. Really enjoyed the hike to this cache, what an awesome scenic area. Circled our way around and finally spotted the stairs we were looking for. The 4 of us squeezed our way thru and searched for the 1st WP. Sadly, we didn't find it (wish we had seen the new note on the cache so we would have known what to do and what to look for!). Thought about just looking around for the final area, but ran out of time, had to get back to camp becausue some guests were coming for smores at 8 and it was 7:40 now. Even tho this was a DNF for me, and I would have loved coming back the next day with TazD, but had to head south to Tennesee. I loved the area and it was worth it even without a smiley. I hope to get back again someday. Thanks! Peppermill 6-Pack(BR)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache
Grahamcracker2	Found it	7/2/2011	We enjoyed this multi with J.A.M.E.S. and it was one of the highlights of our GWIX weekend. This was a fun adventure; the steps were beautiful and out of one of the cave openings was streaming lots of chilly air. The first cave was a tight squeeze to get to the end and to get back out. But success with the first set of cords. The next little cave was less than a 1/4 mile away and had a new container and log sheet. We saw: Indian pipes, blueberries, wintergreen and mountain laurel as we hiked. Thanks for placing this cache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCGY2V_cornplanters-cave-cache

Robbins Family	Found it	3/15/2019	We came down here on our day off of school/work to do some work on our D/T grid. We had hoped to get 4 new squares filled in. Thanks for our 3rd new square of the day with this cache! We failed to get the 4th with the bat cave cache though. We decided it looked too dangerous from the other side, and with several inches of water on this side, and very squishy ground, we deemed it not worth it. Would love to come back sometime if we knew the cave was dry, so that we could walk through it! Thanks for this interesting earth cache! We enjoyed seeing the arches today, but didn't enjoy all the thorns on the way here too much. I can't imagine doing these in the summer!

webdogbert	Found it	12/4/2017	Another grand adventure with the webdogbert and CC land pirate clan for an incredible weekend of hikes, natural wonders and beauty and food fun. Enjoyed a road-cache trip with our great friends for more memories. TFTC. Loved us some skull cave. Favorite.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
CC Land Pirates	Found it	11/25/2017	The CCLP and team webdogbert hooked up for their second annual Thanksgiving Day weekend caching adventure and set their sights on the Hocking Hills and Paint Creek regions of southeastern Ohio. A brisk traffic in caches, natural wonders, travel bugs, potty breaks, and good times highlighted the trip. A giant rental van brought us all together and the plan could not have been enacted any smoother. The caves and arches of Paint Creek state park and Hocking Hills state park were the major focus with a smaller, yet fantastic experience at the shale cliffs near the Copperas Keebler cache. It felt like we were out west and for 30 or so hours our separate families made one bigger and more awesome family. We rocked the Crazy Dogs Grill in Chillicothe and enjoyed some night caching there as well. When the smoke had cleared we had gone 27/29, snagged 14 TBs and dropped 8, sprinkled 5 path tags around the region for future finders, and tragically, abused a wonderful cache by lookinlynn called TBirdhouse. While we can not determine exactly how we did it, we were informed that we left her beautiful and most pleasing cache wide open without the lock we found it with when we first arrived. She has forgiven us and we straightened this all out now. Cachers are such good folk! We have had one in our yard for 5 years now and hosted three events on our property and never had an inkling of trouble. The weather was gorgeous, as was the friendship and family love. Ahhh....to cache! This was such a great experience today! Thanks for bringing us here.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
MTMAN2	Found it	4/15/2017	Well it said only 5% chance of rain as I headed out on this adventure today. I had a few drops of rain at the parking area so at the last minute I threw a small umbrella in my bag otherwise I didn't have any rain gear! Well it started to pour pretty hard as I was trying to find the entrance to Skull Cave! For some reason my GPS wanted me up on top closer to the south stream which I walked up and down twice. Then I walked up on top over GZ. Finally decided I should check out the other stream to the north and then I saw the obvious site I was looking for! I stood for a while at the sinkhole entrance while it was raining really hard. Convinced myself I didn't want to try and go down or in that way! Took advantage of the overhang and cave to do the measurements and explore the cave out of the rain. Made it to the other end and realized it was much better to turn around and go back through the cave rather than try and get up the mud slope! My new Navtec flashlight was awesome! Lit up inside of the cave like it was daylight in there! Answers sent to CO! Fortunately the rain abated by the time I started heading over to the last cache out this way - King of the Mountain! Glad I finally made the trek out here to find these ECs and see the arches -definitely worth the 2+ hour round trip from home! Next time have to come with my bike and check out the short trail in Greenfield. TFTEC Bernoulli! - (Still like your orginal name!!)

dprice95	Found it	12/7/2016	Hiked back for the arches with my daughter. Started out cold, but then it warmed up once we were moving. As everyone has said, routefinding was a bit of a challenge, but we managed! Briefly went around in a circle looking for this one, before figuring it out. Messages send with answers. Thanks for bringing us here!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
Sequoia	Write note	8/7/2016	Yesterday , I returned here for round 2 ( great caches like this are worth a second trip ) with KimPossible and Goldilox. It was a warm n beautiful day to be out whacking bushes and spelunking. I brought a brighter light this time and was able to walk,,,,a,, walk 70% crawl 30% all way thru. Very enjoyable. This cache is on my EPIC cache bookmark list and deserves another fave	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
kim--possible	Found it	8/6/2016	I have been wanting to hike to the arch and cave for a loooooooong time! Today was the day with Sequoia and Goldilocks along. Whew! Bushwhack completed and Skull Cave is in view. Geology ROCKS! What a treat to explore this cave. We even spied a lonely bat hanging around. Thanks for bringing us off the beaten path to see some of Mother Nature's creations! Thanks for the 😃 and HAPPY CACHING!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
Goldilocks+2	Found it	8/6/2016	WOW WOW WOW! I knew we'd be exploring a cave, but didn't realize what a delight it would be. Without a doubt it was the highlight of our evening.

petroypa70	Found it	7/20/2016	Brutal day today heading to this area - very enjoyable area, select to geocaching community almost - never would have known about this - My primary goal today was King of the Mountain today for the D/T rating, but enjoy the earth caches and see there is a challenge for these types of geocaches in Warren County - was going to head for that the next day but was TOTALLY beat from this walk, and was making my way to Midwest Geobash - thanks for this earth cache - actually thought Bat Cave was it originally due to all the bounce - needed a smart phone out there I guess - thanks again for bringing me here - definitely more of a winter walk!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
superjosh92	Found it	5/15/2016	We made the detour for these features on our way to the red river gorge to rock climb for a week. The bushwhack was crazy thick but it was really worth it to explore everything. The nettle and poison ivy are out in full force. After checking out the two other earthcaches, we came looking for this one. My GPS took me right to a hill with nothing in site. Eventually we heard water and found the sinkhole entrance. After carefully making our way in, we were astonished at how deep it was. Didn't even know it went all the way through! Found the traditional and noted the measurements. One of the coolest caves/arches I've been in. Spotted some bats on the way through, hope white nose isn't an issue here. Favorite for sure. Thanks a lot. #12067	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
jax-man	Found it	4/12/2016	Found last Sunday, emailed answers to the CO today. Logging Baby Arch, Trimmer Arch and Skull Cave Arch: Passed by on Sunday on my way home to Pennsylvania - sorry it’s taken me a few days to post my finds and answer the questions. All answers have been sent to the COs. Being from out-of-state, I was so excited to find these three arches so close together. I had two goals for the day: Keep my feet dry, and find all three arches. I managed to attain 1.5 of my goals. I walked through Skull Cave Arch and I’m so glad there was a rope to help me climb out afterwards. Took some pictures of each arch and found my way back to the car. It was a nice hike, but I prefer less bushwhacking. Thanks for the arch lessons and thanks for the caches!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
2McDs	Found it	4/3/2016	We loved this area. We had a problem with both our signal and picture from the log. We kept reading and figuring and we hope we now have it right. It truly is an amazing place. Thanks for bringing us here. TFTEC Nonie and Jim of the 2McDs We will send answers as soon as we get home tomorrow.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
theLadyBee	Found it	2/27/2016	Found with blandestk and KBLAST! We decided to take advantage of the beautiful weather by making our way out to the arches and their caches. We had a wonderful time exploring this beautiful area, enjoying the wonderful weather, and grabbing a few fantastic caches to boot! The trek alone would have been worth it, but the arch/cave was AWESOME! Today, the cave had at least 3 bats taking a nap in there! Luckily they stayed asleep and we were able to enjoy our time in the cave! Thanks for the cache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
blandestk	Found it	2/27/2016	The bee, KBLAST, and I headed south today to explore this area. The weather was phenomenal for late winter and the landscape was much grander than I anticipated. Our final cache of this area and it was a fantastic finale! I really was not anticipating a structure of this scope. We enjoyed exploring the arch in great detail. It is very cool to learn about these unique (in Ohio) formations so close to each other (Skull, Trimmer) and to learn about their creation. I'm kind of an earth cache nerd in that I really do enjoy reading the descriptions and doing research on the geology the cache creators bring me to. So the rarity of this arch's creation was fantastic to visit. Thanks for developing this earth cache and bringing us here!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
KBLAST	Found it	2/27/2016	Had an amazing time in the area and got all the caches in the area with blandestk and TheLadyBee. They took down our answers and will be sending them in when they log the cache. This cave was beautiful and amazing to explore! Thanks for bringing us here, and TFTEC!!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
DMGambrel	Found it	1/31/2016	Talk about spooky! My husband and I had ourselves convinced we were going to come face to face with some wild animal that might be living inside this cave! We slowly trekked in stopping every few feet to check for any noise or movement. Saw about a dozen bats throughout. We turned the corner to start heading out the other side when he shined his flashlight on one of the walls only to discover about a dozen spiders. He shined the flashlight around some more and we discovered that there were far more on the walls than what we originally thought-at least 50 in one small area alone! Since we would have had to walk within inches of the creepy crawly walls, we decided to turn around and head back out to search for the other entrance. He happened to shine the flashlight at one other spot in the ceiling of the cave and found the motherlode of spiders! It was a whole nest of them grouped together. There were at least several hundred there! My heart was pounding at that point and we exited the cave with a quickness! I am afraid of spiders and this cave had so many that I will probably have nightmares for weeks from them, lol! Once out of the cave, we found the other opening (thank you to whoever put the rope there because it was a muddy, slippery mess getting down there). We climbed down and entered back in the cave. I started shining my light around and came face to face (well face to wings and back) of a bat. It was less than a foot from my face which was too close for comfort. I turned around and found two more immediately behind me. We looked around a bit more and then exited back out. All in all it was quite the adventure! Thanks for bringing us to these amazing places-these true hidden gems! This is what geocaching is supposed to be about!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC2R6AR_skull-cave-arch
RecipeForDisaster	Found it	1/18/2020	On a freezing morning, we were on our way to a letterboxing event and stopped to finally get a find in Carlisle and log this long solved puzzle. We had no trouble finding it, especially knowing that it was a bushwack from the trail. All is well here. Interesting information about the area - it was nice to get a little fresh air after driving for a while.

Runr5000	Found it	11/4/2018	I enjoyed a great fall day on the trails in Carlisle.

Rawhyd	Found it	8/30/2018	#3,997. F-i-n-a-l-l-y... After finding "Prospera" and the "Tunnel" both 5 and 7 years ago, respectively... I was able to make my way back here to find the Copper Mine today! I definitely made this one a lot tougher than it needed to be - as I drove all around East Street and Tophet Road looking for the parking before actually solving the puzzle... As it turns out, the main purpose of the listed coordinates is to solve for the offset of the actual hide. (I actually found legitimate parking nearby on East Street.) As others have noted, I was second-guessing my coordinate calculations during my bushwhack... but the easily solved puzzle produced some pretty accurate coordinates - as I found the container perfectly situated on its little pedestal when I arrived. Many thanks to Carl for introducing me to some really interesting history in his town! SL, TFTC! Rawhyd	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1JJRV_when-in-carlisle-the-copper-mine-1840-1850

ecstaticbroccoli	Found it	9/12/2017	I work at a church with bells from Henry Hooper so this was a very interesting piece of history for me! OgreOgre and I came by after school today. Parked just off the road and made the short hike and bushwhack to the cache. OgreOgre got poked in the eye by a hanging tree branch right at eye level. Ouch! She's okay. There wasn't much swag, so we repopulated it with a few more toys (mini pinball game and iron man eraser), as well as a golf pencil. We filled up a bag doing CITO along the trail and at the entrance on our way out. Thanks for the puzzle, the cache, and the adventure! My 101st puzzle cache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1JJRV_when-in-carlisle-the-copper-mine-1840-1850
Catkin&Golden	Found it	3/25/2017	Interesting history that led us to a quiet and pretty trail we wouldn't otherwise have explored.

kestrel76	Found it	3/25/2017	Glad we found this one today, and not in mud/mosquito/humidity season. Ticks were another story since they seem to be here year round nowadays. I'm amazed that Mr Kestrel and I didn't bring any home after that bushwhack. The cache was in good condition and, fortunately, on the near side of the stream. Thanks for the bit of history, and the cache! Hope to visit the local historical society sometime to find out more about the copper mine.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1JJRV_when-in-carlisle-the-copper-mine-1840-1850
BD1982	Found it	3/25/2017	First one of the day with any real bush-whacking and even that was not bad.....did require a tick check afterwards though.

Ericles	Found it	7/21/2019	#4241. Getting caught up on logs... This cache was found with DtB and Monster-Truck on our way to visit the mine and beat the heat by going underground. M-T and I popped out to examine the Sheave Wheels and then casually wondered towards GZ. The GPSr originally had it on the other side of the road but quickly settled in. I think it was suffering heat stroke from the near 100 degree temps but a quick find was made. M-T enjoyed picking through the swag and settled on a carabiner so I could clip the GPSr to my belt. I dropped in a spare pencil and a deck of cards. After sealing the cache back up and replacing as found we stashed the cachemobile and enjoyed a long tour in the museum and underground. M-T panned for precious stones, found some fluorescing pebbles and learned a little something about canaries and methane. Thanks for the cache and the +1 on our mine tour!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC64ER8_a-mine-is-a-terrible-thing-to-waste

PayMeCache	Found it	5/25/2018	Catching up on my logs from earlier this year. Found this while on six day sabbatical. Flew in to Nashville, Tennessee from Denver, Colorado to start my journey. I headed north to Indiana to grab two (2) year 2000 caches before heading east to the U.S.'s first Giga event in Ohio. From there I rounded out a total of 13 states, 12 of which were new to me before making it back to catch my return flight home from Nashville, TN. I ended up over 3,400 miles driven in six days, fixed a flat tire myself on the rental care in the middle of West Virginia on a Sunday, Memorial Day weekend when no place was open to help. Pushed ahead of a Tropical Storm Alberto that I started to play games with me in NC south to Mississippi. I missed my companionship of a couple regular geocachers on my epic trips like this but can proudly state I ended up with the following: 12 new states obtaining a geocache 9 webcams Completed 4 geoarts Found over 20 Earth Caches Grabbed worlds OLDEST mystery cache Grabbed worlds OLDEST multicache Attended USA's FIRST Giga event Signed my John Hancock on nine (9) year 2000 caches Grabbed many 2001, 20002, 2003 and 2004 caches to bring me that much closer to a 4x Jasmer.

This was state and icon 5 on the way south. We bushwhacked through the woods...seemed like the most direct route. Then took the path back to the car. My son was quite interested in the spot and firmly believes if it looks like a cave it's a cave!

Noah's Peeps	Found it	10/22/2019	On vacation with MrPeeps this week - it's been years since we've taken a week's vacation together. Our focus is the state parks in the western UP and select others along our route toward Duluth, MN. It's early evening, it's raining, windy & chilly and we aren't certain of where we might find a room to stay yet tonight.

eagles_landing	Found it	7/11/2017	This is our first trip to Porcupine Mt. State Park and we love it here. It's very pristine and beautiful. We also like the fact that, there are geo-caches here, and especially the earthcaches/virtuals. We learn so much from them. We have sent our answers and will log this as a find. Interesting place. BTW, we have tried to attract bats to our place for a long time. They are the most misunderstood mammal of all. We were disappointed to hear that so many of them have been lost to the White Nose Syndrome. Tragic!

Trekkin' and birdin'	Found it	5/7/2017	We enjoyed the sunny but breezy drive along the lakefront, stopping a couple times to take in the view along the way. Eventually we arrived at the parking area across from the cache site and headed over to take a closer look. Peering beyond the grate into the dark, a sign that read "Closed by Adventure Mine Co," told us getting inside wasn't an option anymore. We also noted the signage nearby about bats hibernating in here, so it's probably best to keep people out. We gathered our information, which we've sent along, then headed across the street to check out some remnants of mining days there. One rather amusing discovery was a frog standing in the pond, occasionally walking around, but mostly just trying to warm up, no doubt. We enjoyed having our attention drawn to this historic location, like so many others in the U.P. Thanks for developing this EarthCache.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3PFZ9_carp-lake-mine

PROBOB	Found it	8/25/2016	Took my family on a grand tour of the entire Upper Peninsula of Michigan. My main goals for this trip were to go after high quality caches - including the U.P.'s oldest active cache and as many virtuals as possible (I got 18 out of the 21 I need in the U.P. plus one in Canada)... to knock off the remaining counties I needed (have all 83 now)... grab some in Wisconsin to add another state to my list... and most importantly - take my family to see as many awesome places as we can. They're not into caching at all, so I didn't expect to be able to get big numbers this week, but am really excited that I somehow got just over 100. Heading from Copper Harbor to Ironwood via the Lake of the Clouds today. After we departed the awesome lake view, I figured why not stop for this earthcache on our way out. I ran over to check out the info sign, that's just batty - then collected the required info (which I already emailed). It was cool to hear the running water inside. I tried shining a flashlight in there, but couldn't see much. What an amazing and memorable trip, thanks for adding to it!!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3PFZ9_carp-lake-mine
AnotherCrafter	Found it	7/31/2016	Enjoyed our stop here at the Carp Lake Mine. The mine was full of running water today (is it always?) and we enjoyed the information on the bats on the sign. We also took a short walk to enjoy the view on the other side of the road. Although we've been to the Porcupines many times, this was the first time we'd stopped at this location. Thanks for the cache!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3PFZ9_carp-lake-mine
gsix5666	Found it	7/16/2016	On a trip with BWY Gang and Ramblin' Rumble to the U.P. for a caching trip that involved the old caches and Virtuals. We were able to accomplish our goal of finding all the Virtual caches in the U.P. and getting the Brain Hill cache during this trip with a lot of driving. Had a great time. Thanks for keeping these caches up and running. gsix5666 Roseville, MI	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3PFZ9_carp-lake-mine
Ramblin' Rumble	Found it	7/16/2016	Headed up to the UP with my sweetie, BWY Gang and Gsix5666 to get all of the virtual caches, all of the caches published in 2001 and any other old caches along the way as well as anything else that suited our fancy. We had a great time spending countless hours in the van, hiking, seeing lots of lighthouses and too many other things to mention. We were from one end of the UP to the other and went from top to the bottom, what a great weekend and a great time. Just want to thank all of the CO's for placing the caches and for adding to our memorable weekend of lunacy.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3PFZ9_carp-lake-mine
BWY Gang	Found it	7/16/2016	What a crazy extended weekend cachathon with Ramblin' Rumble and GSix5666. I think it is safe to say that we all are certifiable. We headed up to the UP to grab old caches and all the virtuals. This was my first time to the UP and I loved it. I saw so many cool sights and amazing things while circling the state. Thanks to all who placed caches/virtuals thereby giving us an awesome adventure. TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3PFZ9_carp-lake-mine

southern traveler	Found it	5/1/2016	6,000th FIND After spending some time in Florida finding caches, I was able to work my way to the 6,000 cache finds milestone. I saved that find to make it a special one for me. My friend and caching partner published this earthcache back in the summer of 2012 and I had never been in the area to visit it. When I returned home, I decided that this was the cache that I was going to log as my 6,000th find. This morning pluvs2hunt picked me up and we headed to the Porcupine Mountains State Park so that I could see Carp Lake Mine cache and log this very special find. It was extra special because I could share the milestone with her. When there, she told me that when she published this cache, the bars were not across the entrance to the mine. You could venture back in the tunnel for a very neat experience. But it is now closed off and many of the bats that used the mine cave for hibernation have been dying off from white-nose syndrome. I enjoyed seeing the cache and the ride up here was enjoyable with nice views and spotted wildlife. We saw three tom turkeys, several deer, and a porcupine. Thank you for publishing this earthcache and accompanying me on my 6,000th find. TFTC. Cache on …..	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3PFZ9_carp-lake-mine

go-purdue	Found it	10/16/2018	I am in Tennessee for a couple of days with zugzwang and the two youngest kids. On our trip, we saw a semi truck engulfed in fire, and this was about 40 miles after we saw a man lying on the side of the road with his 'friends' helping him (we stopped to offer assistance, but they said they had it under control.) We certainly hope they were helping him, and not doing anything shady. We saw another person sick at the side of the road (seriously people, these roads aren't THAT curvy!. We played Hillbilly Golf and attended Sweet Fanny Adam's Theatre, a throw back from when I was a kid visiting this location. We were approached by a woman who said to our children, "Hey kids, you wanna see a bear?" with a gravelly voice that can only be attributed to her smoking habit. We visited the "Rocky Waterfall" for many hours as our kids were fish to water here. We were quizzed in trivia about Forrest Gump, visited Wonder Works, cached in the rain and in the sunshine, went on hikes, saw a REAL BEAR climbing a tree, took pictures of foggy cabins and dewy spiderwebs, saw some damage from the fires from two years ago, did a library cache, slipped and almost did a face plant on a grc, climbed an old tower on the top of a mountain (with a message saying "Turn Back While You Can!" on the railing), saw some old abandoned cabins on the side of the same mountain, saw some very pretty covered bridges, battled in the pigeon forge traffic a couple times but managed to avoid it most of the time, got stung by yellow jackets while getting a geocache (and had a bad reaction to it!) and had a fun time on our three day adventure down south.

Got a rental car which is much easier to drive around these mountainous roads than the motorhome. This was a find on our first geocaching trip in the car. Getting to this cemetery and parking were much easier in the car than it would have been in the motorhome. Enjoyed the story about the lost mine. One can believe such a thing exists. On this geocache we initially followed the phone app coordinates into the woods. Were unsuccessful and just walked around the cemetery looking at headstones. Along the way we found the geocache in its hiding spot. All is well. Thanks for the cache and the interesting history.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJH6N_the-lost-shults-mine

A sprinkley rain persisted throughout the day, but that did not stop us. Some of the sights we saw were amazing; a few of the roads we traversed were not for the faint of heart. A very nice roadside cemetery. Only 2 stones without the Shultz name. An easy find. I have always enjoyed cemetery caches; reading the stones and wondering what their lives were like.

HITECHTEAM	Found it	8/25/2017	Catching up on our logging. On August 25, hitechgeek (grandson), our daughter, hitechgal, and I headed into Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg to see the sights and to do some caching. We ended up doing some zip lining, going to Dave’s Nursery in Seymour to purchase a few flowering shrubs to bring back to Michigan, and had to stop at Bud’s Gun Shop to fire some automatic weapons on their range. We also made a visit to the Smoky Mountain Knife Works and the Aquarium. Quick one for us. Our MiGO Geocoin (our cache odometer) made the visit with us. We signed the log and took nor left anything.

Sought and Found	Found it	7/16/2014	I had a little bit of time after dropping of some students to be tourists in Gatlinburg, so I decided to head for this cache. I was in the area with a group of students from the South Carolina Governor’s School for Science And Mathematics. They were taking a field ecology class with me and we had been enjoying hikes in various trails in the mountains. I was able to find the cache fairly quickly. This was a great area, and after finding the cache, I looked at the headstones and reflected on the activities of the lives of the people who were buried there. The history lesson that was part of this cache description was interesting. TFTC SL (1607)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJH6N_the-lost-shults-mine

bdccacher	Needs Maintenance	10/8/2012	Was out with a friend, introducing them to geocaching and we stopped at this one quick. The lid to the container appears to have been bitten by an animal. As such, the recent rains have totally soaked the inside of the container, and since the log bag wasn't properly zipped, the log is now soaking wet too! A new log, bag, and lid are needed to fully repair this cache. (And maybe upgrading the container to something more... wildlife proof?)	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJH6N_the-lost-shults-mine

trowel32	Found it	5/8/2012	We were staying right across the street so I felt we kind of HAD to grab this cache before we left the area. We pulled up really close to the cache and parked kind of oddly, so the guy doing the lawn kind of had his eye on us, but I grabbed the cache quickly and we looked at the stones while signing in. Nice quick find and I tried to cover the cache a bit better when we left as it was sort of visible when I had initially grabbed it. We drove back down the road a bit further to look around but did not discover the mine. Thanks for the hide and interesting history	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCJH6N_the-lost-shults-mine

We thought it was a DNF until we went down the road and made a turn around. As we went by again, I told my husband to "stop!" and ran back over to where I thought it might be. It was just one of those "ah-ha" sort of thoughts. There it was! I did the happy dance and pulled it out. I think of this container more of a nano also, as others have stated.

We were there during the Cherry Festival and enjoyed taking our canoe out on Grande Traverse Bay to Power Island and driving through the Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes Park. It was a flurry of virtuals and Earthcaches, scenic views, as well as two oldies for my jasmer. We were there in the middle of a heat wave with temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius but we found several bodies of water to cool off in during the day as we traveled around. Thanks for contributing to our wonderful vacation !	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3QYDA_monitor-mine
Inuksuk.	Found it	7/2/2018	This was our first Earthcache of many during our one week vacation to Michigan from Ontario. We slept in the back of the truck and canoed out to Power Island on Grande Traverse Bay. We took in Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes Park and road tripped all the way back to central east Ontario. Of all the mines we've been to since geocaching, I don't think I've ever been to a coal mine. We've seen coal beds in rock cuts in Quebec and the east coast of Canada. But we live on the Canadian Shield so it's mostly hard rock minerals up there. I wish we could have accessed this slag pile up close and personal. But thanks for the educational pit stop. The description on the cache page is excellent. Answers have been sent to the CO and I'm uploading a photo now.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3QYDA_monitor-mine

KenGlennR	Found it	8/4/2019	Came up to do the Signature Rock Discovery Tour today and had an incredible experience. Started by going through much of the traditional tour. Before boarding the boat, we were given our gear to put on for the adventure tour. When the boat reached the typical turn around point is where things began to get real fun. We were allowed to get out of the boat, climb over the chains and begin walking towards those damn doors. Tour guides opened the doors to allow us to pass through and continue a more natural cave tour. We waded through water and walked on some slippery mud to many original interesting areas that Lester Howe had established. After our adventure tour, we returned back to the boats where we hitched a ride back with some of the traditional tour boat riders. A really fun afternoon had by all! Thanks for the adventure Howe Caverns and thanks for the earth cache monet37! Answers to the questions have been sent.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

In spite of the many times I have driven through this area I had never visited here. What a cool place (and I mean that both literally and figuratively)! One of the girls in my troop really enjoys caching and was helping me to listen for the answers to all the questions as we enjoyed the 90 minute tour. Thanks for the education and for the opportunity to log another earthcache - this has to be one of my favorites. Answers sent to CO.

Edina351	Found it	7/13/2018	Found it :) More later. Answers will be sent soon to CO. Later- this cache has been on my list of "Special Caches" for over 2 years. When planning my ADK vacation, I realized this cache was nearby and added it to my list for the trip. I stayed overnight in nearby Amsterdam Castle, which was one of the most unique and most peaceful stays I've experienced. After leaving the castle (actually a restored armory) this morning, I headed to Howe Caverns, wondering if it would be similar to the Luray Caverns which I visited last year. I arrived and the parking attendant remarked on the kayak in my truck and told me about some great places in the area to kayak! I bought my ticket and waited for the next tour to start, admiring the OCC motorcycle in the waiting area (pretty sure I saw the episode where they built it). Our tour guide was friendly and I told him about the earthcache. He said he'd try to help but it was his 5th day. For his 5th day, he did a phenomenal job. Our group ended up being a small group of 11, with only one small child who was very well behaved. I was thankful to be in this group rather than some of the very large groups we saw of about 25-30 people. I took many photos while gathering the needed info. I really enjoyed the boat ride part of this tour as well as the more confined winding way and the calcium heart. Our tour lasted about 2 hours, as we spent some time waiting for the larger groups ahead to proceed. This gave us a lot of time for exploring and taking pictures, which I enjoyed as it felt much more leisurely and not at all rushed. After the tour, I enjoyed a nice lunch of blackened salmon on ciabatta along with a hot cup of coffee in the cafe. Thanks so much for a great earthcache!

We headed out for a state count not a cache count before leaving for home. Vermont was next on out list to be followed by Mass. ( no I will not try to spell it)ending in New Hampshire. We loved caching in the mountains even though we yet another steady rain/drizzle. The valleys and peaks are striking in the yellows and reds and oranges of the early fall color. Too bad we could not be here for the full fall color show. We cached an amazing 10 states in 6 days though we barely scratched the surface of these great states. We have seen oceans, valleys, and mountains and yet we are still amazed at the beauty and serenity of our great country.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

This was a side trip we stopped at and I was so glad there was an earth cache here. We paid the $25 fee each and entered the elevator for the trip down into the cave. It was so cool literally and we thoroughly enjoyed the tour with our guide Nicole. Josh the boat driver was excellent as well. We were able to get all the questions answered and after getting the green light from the CO I am now logging my find. Many thanks for placing this interesting earth cache for us to enjoy. This cache gets a favorite point TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

geo.duck	Found it	3/24/2016	Arrived here after the last tour, but was able to visit the rather impressive lodge. An employee at the gift store was also a tour guide and had the answers to my every question. Many commercially-operated caves are overhyped tourist traps, but this one seems to be legit.

Tundra Wolf	Found it	10/28/2015	<b>******************THIS CACHE IS OUR #11,100TH MILESTONE FIND********************</b><p><p>It was a rainy day, but the Wolf Pack of the Southern Tier of NY........including the <i>"little wolves"</i> Jewel & Luna .......was fast approaching our <b>#11,100TH milestone cache.</b> I try to find a special and worthwhile cache for us to do every 100TH cache.......usually dog or wolf themed . I also like virtuals, and in this case I found this Earthcache which is one of the VERY FEW <u>Earthcaches</u> we'd not yet done within probably <u>one hundred miles</u> from the den ! I was going to go this weekend for it, but when I saw several new caches up near Cooperstown (which with a little imagination is SORT OF on the way.....), my first to find lust lead me to haul off and go up today ! Well we got a bit wet and <u>MISSED</u> every dang one of the THREE first to finds we tried for to the local first to find hounds..........but I DID have fun on the cave tour when we met up with our buddy Mrmacman2U and his geodog Meeka ! We also came home with another <b>half dozen</b> smileys and the rain even stopped so I could get a good milestone picture taken with the pack out front !<p><p>I had last taken this tour <b>THIRTY YEARS AGO!</b> It was a trip down memory lane today . So much has not changed at all here (well, the price has TRIPLED since I was here !) It was fun seeing so much I remembered and also noticing a few new things too! We have decided to come back and do the "adventure tour" where you are guided into a part of the cave that has no amenities......like walkways and lights . This gets on the pack's favorite list for sure! The email has been sent, and I will upload the photo shortly. Thanks Monet37 for setting this one up and so giving me a reason to come back here after so many years !!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

DaCoopskat	Found it	8/3/2015	Haven't been in the cave since I took my kids then grand kids down...long time passin. I was impressed that I remembered as much as I had but needed a refresher course. Howe cave is now host to both Gemstone mining with Geode cutting and Howe High Adventures; neither of which were around when I was last here. I also learned there was a museum which I had never known before, so made sure to stop and check that out which brought me new insight....So This is were the "original" cave was located and its amazing that with the mining done so close to the cavern that they didn't drill through or "blow" it up!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

I have seen pictures of the caverns before but never in person. Obviously, the pictures do not do it justice. Our tour guide was great. He knew the ins and outs about the cave and did not hesitate to answer questions. I really enjoyed the boat ride even though it felt like we were going to tip a few times. The Winding Way was great, even though it was a tight fit in a few spots due to my massive bulk. We added another tour of another awesome spot in NY to our travel resume.

spikep	Found it	5/25/2014	The Maryland Zombie Horde was on their way home for a family thing in Mass. On our way home we decided to stop and do something fun. This earthcache directed us to a great afternoon. The owners gave us one heck of a discount for being veterans and our daughters were excited about the prospect of taking a boat ride underground! Considering how crowded the place was, we didn't have to wait long and we were watching the intro movie and riding the elevator down. We've been to many a cavern before but this one was probably the best of them all and the longest. After our tour, we had a nice lunch, grabbed some items from the gift shop before getting back in the car for the rest of the 7 hour car ride. We got in around midnight and passed out. Thanks for bringing us here and putting in the time to have this one published. E-mail sent with answers.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

Timpat	Found it	2/22/2014	A million yrs ago when we were kids my dad and mom took us 4 kids here and I remember it being an exciting exploration of the caves and staying at the lodge here. Now being older the enclosed spaces make me very uncomfortable sorry to say. Still a wonderful geologic feature that all should see and experience. Thanks for highlighting this gem to bring the geocaching demographic here. Nicely written up cache page, too. A FAv of course.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

Castleraine	Found it	10/11/2013	We are off for a nice little vacation and we spent half of our first day at Howe Cavern. What an AWESOME tour it was. We ended up doing the Lantern Tour, where for the last half of the tour, all the cave lights are turned off, and you are given a candle in a tin can basically, and it was so beautiful to walk through and see it the way Lester Howe first saw it many years ago. Unfortunately you have to be 16 or older to do this tour, but there is always family flashlight Sunday! Will post pics & email after trip, thanks for having this Earthcache to to!!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

I've come quite a few times but not in the last 8 years so it was nice to see it again. I used to love coming to the Halloween haunted caves... do they still do that?

Jen&RicVan	Found it	2/5/2013	Been to Howe Caverns a couple of times in the past before we started geocaching. Decided to return today to do the earthcache and earn another smiley.

LCSM	Found it	10/14/2012	Sending our answers. . . we enjoyed our visit. I was here at age 3, and got stuck scrambling over a boulder (before they had the red brick paths.) I went back with S and M when S was about 3, and saw the pebble that trapped me years ago. Now, the narration is a tad different. In fact, at one point, they explained that the reason you can't bring in pets is because 80 years ago, when they were working on the electrical wiring, a boy brought in a pet mouse in his pocket. When he leaned over the railing, the mouse fell into the water, was zapped, and flew up tot he ceiling, where he is now covered with a thin layer of calcite. I definitely would have remembered this. Based on how slowing stalactites form, it would have still looked like a mouse when I first saw this. . . .45+ years ago. Hmm. Anyway, it makes for a good story. C had never been here before, so it was time to rectify that. Thanks for the fun.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

majormajor42	Found it	9/13/2012	Just sent off our answers. We were driving update to Saratoga for the weekend. We had some time to enjoy ourselves so while driving up the highway I turned to Lovemonkey42 and said that we should do one of the things that we see advertised on billboards. Howe Caverns is certainly one of those. So we got off the highway and had a nice drive though parts of NY we rarely see. The caverns were great. We were able to answer most without having to ask our guide specific questions. And when we got back on the highway we were able to see the quarry next door that we heard so much about. Great side trip this was. Good Times.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

ghettomedic	Found it	5/5/2012	My wife and I decided to take my parents out to Niagara falls for a vacation, they had never been there. This was our half-way point for a few hours out of the car. The cavern is really cool and awesome. It was off season and we ended up getting a private tour with just the four of us as there were no other visitors. Took tons of pictures but forgot a parking lot pic, so hopefully this one will be acceptable.

CT A-Team	Found it	1/29/2012	My greatgrandson has been doing so well in school that I decided to give him a gift of a trip to Howe Caverns. I was there once as a kid and was hoping he would enjoy it as much as I did back then. He did. We stopped for a few caches on the way up and then reviewed the questions before going in. Each time the tour guide would reveal one of the answers Ian would chime in "Grandpa, that's one of the questions." "Remember it." I told him. Thanks for adding to our adventure in the cave by letting us do our favorite sport together... Geocaching. Walt and Ian	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC18ZAN_howe-cave-earthcache

Frin and Frak	Found it	4/8/2011	We decided to do some caches in Schoharie County today. There were two things that attracted us to the Howe Cave Earthcache. We really enjoy earth caches and We've been to Howe Caverns so many times since we were kids. We actually visited Howe Caverns on one of our first dates. This was the third find of the day for Frin and Frak. We took our pictures in the HOWE CAVERN letters on that first date. Today there were kids swarming over the letters doing just the same thing. Queensbury had decided to bring the kids to the caverns for a up close and personal look at stalactites and stalagmites. Nice!

cbiij	Found it	9/30/2014	Hard to believe that the cache would disappear and the log would remain, but as the last cacher said a couple weeks ago, that's exactly the way it is! We used a flashlight and a tool to check all around the hiding spot and couldn't find anything else. If we would have had a container with us, we would have replaced it. Hope it gets fixed for future cachers soon. Thanks for bringing us back to this interesting spot, which we haven't visited in many years.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCNW8H_republic-mine-view

HurricaneLaurk	Found it	6/8/2019	This one. This one was my 5th (and last) of the day. Right before we left, I saw this one on my map and decided we should just go for it. What an adventure! The hike was a really great one, and the reward of a find with a nicely sized container was quite the reward! Though, we found a throwdown cache right beside the actual cache. I left it just in case. What an awesome hike and an area I would have never discovered had this cache not been here. I’m giving this a fave point. :D TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16TF5_gag11-mine

The goal was achieved but not before trudging 12 km on rock-covered trails. Looking forward to the next geo-art in the area. The opportunity to visit the abandoned mine works and seeing actual derelict side-dump ore cars was COOL! TFTC, T r-h w!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16TF5_gag11-mine
GPComd	Found it	10/20/2018	Found with a 3-pack of SOBs (Sigspig, Gis-Guy, and Mattawa) on a beautiful walk through the trails on the edge of Gatineau Park. Some fun puzzles, some hard finds, some slippery walking, and the weather cooperated this morning. This was a really cool place to visit - gets a favorite point. We were a bit worried that we might have taken the incorrect route/elevation to GZ, but it was good. Thanks for hiding the cache here and bringing us to the woods today!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16TF5_gag11-mine
gis-guy	Found it	10/20/2018	Out with fellow SOB's GPComd, SigsPig and Mattawa on a nice October morning. The mine's pit was downright scary. Imagine any person or animal that may fall in where the fence is down, NEVER getting out...no cell signal down there, but probably lots of bones. :b SigsPig made the find. On our way out, I noted 2 large iron spikes in the rock...perhaps they were prepping to do some more blasting before they abandoned the site? TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16TF5_gag11-mine
SigsPig	Found it	10/20/2018	Out with the SOBs this morning consisting of GIS-Guy, GPComd & Mattawa. Shortest drive to give everyone some finds put us in Billy goat terrain aka Gatineau.

Chickymunkey	Found it	10/8/2018	The birthday tradition continued with the Libra trio (Rockumulus, blackspirit and I) spending the day caching. This year's destination was the Hull geo-art and anything else we came across. The day was a little cool but luckily the rain held off until we were heading home. I enjoyed the mix of park and grabs followed by trail hikes. This time of year is a wonderful time to be on trails admiring the changing leaves. Thank you to all the COs for putting out the caches for me to enjoy. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16TF5_gag11-mine
blackspirit	Found it	10/8/2018	Rockumulus, Chickymunkey and I continued our yearly tradition of getting together to celebrate our birthdays. We are all within a one week span and this year's outing fell on Chickymunkey's special day. Our main focus was the Hull GeoArt but we picked up all the others we came across during our travels. TFTC	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC16TF5_gag11-mine
Rockumulus	Found it	10/8/2018	C'est une tradition de célébrer mon anniversaire et celui de Chickymunkey en faisant une sortie de géocaching en début octobre. Cette année, nous quittons notre Ontario pour se diriger vers Hull, pour s'attaquer au géo-art HULL. C'est Chickymunkey et Blackspirit qui ont attiré mon attention vers cette série de cache. Je dois être franc et avouer qu'elles ont fait la majorité du travail. Elles ne m'ont alloué que quelques caches à résoudre et j'ai pu avoir un goût de la série. La journée d'aujourd'hui a été superbe. Un peu froid comme journée mais nous étions bien habillés et content de ne pas avoir de pluie comme l'an passé. Tout s'est bien déroulé avec aucun DNF au cours de la journée. Nous avons complété le géo-art en 6h et avons obtenu par le fait même, le souvenir d'octobre. Celle-ci fut notre arrêt #34 aujourd'hui. Je donne un point favori mais ce n'Est pas parce que je l'ai eu facile... Je monte d'abord 50 m d'altitude sur le flanc sud en suivant la clôture mais j'arrive à 20 m du PZ qui est passé la clôture. Il y a une pancarte de danger, donc je cherche un peu...mais ça ne correspond pas au photos. Je descends 50 m et je monte ensuite 50 m d'altitude sur le flanc nord en suivant la clôture mais j'arrive à 10 m du PZ qui est passé la clôture. Il y a une pancarte de danger, donc je cherche un peu...mais ça ne correspond pas au photos. Je redescends 50 m pour trouver une entrée à : 45 28.495 -75 47.223 J'entends des anges chanter lorsque je vois enfin la bonne pancarte de danger! Trouvaille instantanée au PZ, 45 minutes plus tard!

Soyez prudents dans les environs de la cache, la clôture autour de la mine est maintenant partiellement effondrée, et il suffirait d'un moment de distraction pour se retrouver en très facheuse position.

CanThai	Found it	5/5/2018	Out and about ...caching with LEBTF in Gatineau. This is an area that I do not go too often. I will now start going more often. Today's goal was to find a few high targets before a breakfast event then continue with some solved puzzles (all while sprinking in a few trads here and there). We approached it from the north and quickly figured we were at the wrong approach. After a reset, we made our way to the GZ. After looking around for a while, reading back logs and looking at spoiler pictures, we had decided to give up. Then I as I CITO some plastic bags, I made the find. Second container also gone. We put the "ziplock host" and a very wet log back where we thought the GZ was meant to be and took some pictures that will be sent to the CO. Cache does need some TLC. Great location - hopefully it will not be archived. Thanks to The red-haired witch for placing this cache. SL TNLN. TFTC.

KanoeBillder	Found it	5/30/2018	This was one of 3 I wanted to do this morning after parking on Townsend Road. As I neared GZ the mine was impossible to miss. I wondered how they were able to pump the water out while they were working in it way back whenever the mine was in operation. There must still be plenty of iron in the area as something was really messing with my GPS signal. I searched the right side of the mine opening thoroughly but couldn't spot anything resembling a cache. My Garmin's pointer kept leading me away and I continued to work my way around to the right, going further and further from the mine. I finally spotted it, but it was a good distance from where my signal wanted me to be. The cache wasn't easy to spot. Even though it was in direct line of sight, it blended in with it's hide's surroundings so well that I missed it twice. The stream channel may have changed since this was placed. Thanks for bringing me out here today.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BWRN_never-you-mine
bneiman	Found it	3/5/2018	Very interesting location.

WaylessWood	Found it	12/10/2017	I enjoy the act of trying to make sense of my friends logs for this cache. Mine too would probably have been a puzzle had I used my phone to log finds, as they did. I was just not feeling like using dictation and hoping my log made sense. Congratulations to WNC. Eleven years of making attempts to find this cache and finally he gets the find. One thing learned today, do not trust the "ground" you are standing on near the mine, if there is snow on said ground. The solid surface was not so solid and I sank up to my knees! Fortunately I maintained my balance and also had BB's assistance. WNC was reveling in the find and missed the fun.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BWRN_never-you-mine

BriGuyNY	Found it	1/22/2017	Cool old mine! So many around this region on both sides of the state line. Lizrdh and I had a lot of fun through this upper corner of Norvin, and this was definitely one of those highlights. While Liz took some pictures, I made my way along the stream bed to GZ, slightly south of where the GPS wanted us, but true to the clue for sure. Everything here is in great shape! Best of luck to the next, and TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BWRN_never-you-mine
Lizrdh	Found it	1/22/2017	An exciting part of the hiking journey with BriGuy, as we're now at the junction of three trails, PLUS we've arrived at this cool mine! It's flooded with muddy water today. I was busy snapping a pic of the mine while Brian was headed for the hide. He took the low road by the water and I stayed a bit higher and worked my way through the leaves to join him. The cache is a little bit south of where coords brought us, but that could also be from the rock and tree cover out here. We made sure not to remove this container after noting that it's still active unlike its many old neighbor caches. Thanks for showing us this really great spot along the trails!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC1BWRN_never-you-mine

Team Geofrog	Found it	8/2/2015	briansnat I found your cache Never You Mine on 8/2/15, 4:09 PM. This is my find #4307 and find #6 today. After my family had been bickering earlier on the trail, this stop got them a bit happier as there are a lot of tiny frogs here. The kids were busy trying to catch them. My wife, not so much. She was just trying to not step on them. The coordinates put me on the other side of the stream. I couldn't say how far off they were for me as I did not have time to do an average for you. Frogs only keep people entertained so long and I was just about to DNF this one. The coin has been missing since 2008. Please mark it as missing. The cache is in good shape.

*gln	Temporarily Disable Listing	10/10/2017	STATUS UPDATE NEEDED OR POSSIBLY OWNER ATTENTION NEEDED Greetings cache owner, I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last few logs on this cache it appears that this cache may be in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. From the guidelines... CACHE MAINTENANCE "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing." If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered. If the ”NEEDS MAINTENANCE” attribute is showing you will need to do the following. CACHES THAT NEED MAINTENANCE Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and may be archived. I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I will be looking forward to hearing back from you soon. In the meantime your cache has been disabled. Thanks for your understanding, Thanks, *gln, Mongo and Banjo-Boy Your Missouri Geocache Reviewers How to enable your geocache for further review.How to get your cache published quickly.Cache listing requirements can be found here.

For the last 13 caches, we planned to grab three in each of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, and then have an old virtual for the actual 5,000th. This was the first of the run, and I'm glad this area doesn't get much foot traffic, at least not from anyone paying attention. Thank you for the fascinating story.

Foundinnj	Found it	1/26/2019	I had a rare day where my Geocaching buddy was not able to cache with me. At that point, I go for something with lots of hiking. I looked around and spotted the Sussex branch trail and the bike trail. I left South Jersey around 5 am and got to the parking spot around 7:30 am. It was 18 degrees when I started and warmed up to 30 by the time I ended my hike. I parked and headed north then did the loop around the lake on the bike trail. After that I ended up on the rail trail and headed north to the end and worked my way back to the car. I ended up hiking over 9 miles in about 5 hours. It was very enjoyable being here. Great views and a nice river to walk along. I left around 12:30. I ended up finding everything except one cache, bummer. A couple of them gave me a hard time. Glad there were hints for most of them. My GPS is always off in this area. Not used to looking through rocks and leaves for caches. Thanks for placing this cache for all to find. TFTC SL. This one drove me nuts. I kept looking in one spot over and over. I was sort of giving up and I expanded my search and ended up finding it. Nice view of the rive here. Glad there is a bridge across it.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6NRY6_sussex-mine-railroad-pr5

StSquirrel	Found it	1/6/2019	Out for some caching fun with a great group today. Stellarscapes, Eyeball&Chain, MafiaBoss, Gilwell1 and The K-Team. We signed in as the "Six Pack." A great time was had by all. The weather was pretty good, the company was fantastic, and we had no DNF's! We were having such a great time talking, we had to back-track a few times (oops!) When the area was chosen, we were told it's a bike trail; turns out mountain bikes, but that's only if you're crazy. The trail was very well marked, with both blazes and arrows. Those of us who hadn't found this one already started to search the area, and were a bit dismayed at all the water around the base of the rocks. But, we soon heard every cacher's favorite phrase: "Found it!" And that was by someone who wasn't even really looking! TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6NRY6_sussex-mine-railroad-pr5
The K-Team	Found it	1/6/2019	Out caching today with Stellarscapes, Eyeball&Chain, MafiaBoss, Gilwell1 and StSquirrel.

TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6NRY6_sussex-mine-railroad-pr5
stellarscapes	Found it	1/6/2019	Found this cache while geocaching today with a group that included The K-Team, StSquirrel, Eyeball&Chain, MafiaBoss, and Gilwell1. We all met at the main trailhead parking, then headed up the trail and around the lake in a counter-clockwise direction. It started out as a cloudy morning, but the sun eventually came out later in the day. Had a great time on the hike finding 20 caches here and got in over 14,000 steps on my Fitbit. This nearby stream and waterfall was very pretty. Since there were six of us, we signed in on the log using a team name "Six Pack". TNLNSL. Thanks for hiding a cache here.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6NRY6_sussex-mine-railroad-pr5

Cameras out and we were soon searching for the best shot. I thought I had it (including the rays of sun shining down from above) until Bone stepped right into the frame*. Crazy timing. Anyway, thanks for bringing us to the cool area and TFTC! *photo attached	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6NRY6_sussex-mine-railroad-pr5

Looking forward to a great day, and as we are opportunistic catchers we intend to make finds along the way. This one probably took us longer than what it should have because we were looking at the huge crack and tree between the two huge Boulders in fact I may have even got on my knees and hands and crawled under there was no need for that but old and foolish so you never know what I might do but we appreciate the slow down and got a better look at it I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Barkley loves running and dashing, In Mire, muck, mud he is splashing!

Lauterburger	Found it	10/20/2018	Today we were in NJ for the 2018 Metro Gathering ~ Witches of Salem event. The area where the event was was just great and suitable for Halloween. Of course, one or the other geocache was searched. The hiding places were usually easy to find and the logbook was then signed. We would like to thank everyone who planned and conducted the great event. Greetings from Germany Lauterburger & Hanni1111 One, two, Freddy's coming for you.

We found all of them along the loop we chose and got a pretty good workout, so it seems that we chose wisely. Thanks so much for placing and maintaining these caches.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6NRY6_sussex-mine-railroad-pr5
Twinklekitkat	Found it	10/19/2018	Caching this part of the Highlands Trail today with BuzzardWhisperer before the event this evening at the Boy Scout camp. Approached this one from The Gentle Giant and took a wrong turn for a few hundred feet on what was perhaps part of the old railroad right of way. We course corrected picking up the blue blazes again and landed in this beautiful area for a geocache hide. We searched a little longer for this one but soon found it, hearing that clunk of stick against can!

KanoeBillder	Found it	8/28/2018	The cache is dry and in good shape. It took a few minutes to find as the compass pointer on my GPS was misbehaving.

BriGuyNY	Found it	10/28/2017	No mines to be seen here, but a nice walk nonetheless with LabRat, cdparker1 (and mom), and DeathlyHallows. Enjoyed the bridge crossing followed by a (very careful) bushwhack off trail to GZ. The group was ahead of me, and somehow zipped right past GZ, so I uncovered this one and called everyone back. Obviously repurposed, I wonder what Treequest location this used to be at? Well, it is here now and in great shape. This place looks much better today than those 19th Century photos (but that photo with the push-cart is really awesome). Thanks for bringing us here, and TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6NRY6_sussex-mine-railroad-pr5

I went back down to drop my rain coat on the bottom and looked at the hint. Then with that in mind I started my way up, while ducks was working her way down. We met near the cache.

greenducks	Found it	9/8/2018	Stopped by for this one with pH 7.0 and urpickle during the CITO event. pH already had this one from a long time ago, but couldn't remember the area. No worries.

Lots of miles were put on the hiking boots, lots of up's and down's and up's again. Sometimes, it also felt like we were back at the Thousand Steps ! Seeing as Nature is coming back to life, this was the perfect time to tackle this area. All in all, a great day of fun and exercise. Got here in a rounabout way. Thank you Tom873 for the cache and smiley.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15MAP_to-the-bat-cave
Zooming Boomers	Found it	4/23/2014	Spent a windy but beautiful spring day caching the Wissahickon Creek Park area with skibumz. Copious amounts of miles walked and an abundance of unexpected hills to climb. (Next time we will definitely look at the topo maps before heading out.) As always, lots of laughs and adventures with a great friend. Found ourselves on the wrong trail on this one. TFTH!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15MAP_to-the-bat-cave

Rebel Cruzer	Found it	8/14/2013	#2700! I had been hiking and biking along Forbidden Dr. earlier today, and looked for this using my smart phone and the "updated" geocaching app. It was very inaccurate with locations, and kept crashing when I would post a log or update local cache listings... Anyway, I used the clue, and spent a considerable amount of time looking in the wrong spot, that matched the hint perfectly! I also checked out the cave extensively, and enjoyed this really neat spot. But eventually left empty-handed to go find a puzzle cache. Later in the day, I was still nearby and had locked up the bike, so approached this from a different direction using my GPSr. It turned up with much more accurate coords, and I made a quick find. It was forty feet from where I parked my bike earlier and was in a spot I never searched! Do'h! Nice hide, SL TFTC!	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15MAP_to-the-bat-cave

MysteryPaintballMan	Didn't find it	7/26/2013	We found the cave. But that was it. A man who i'm guessing is either living around or in the cave, or maybe just drunk/high approached us and was yelling at us. I didn't really understand what he was saying as we left pretty quickly. Seemed a really great and fun one for kids until he scared my daughter, might want to remove the good for kids identifier until someone can confirm that this guy isn't really living in there.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15MAP_to-the-bat-cave

punkrockmuppet	Didn't find it	3/3/2013	This one has appeared to be muggled. I found at the GZ a plot of dirt with an exact rectangle the size of an ammo can plotted in the dirt, where the cache once was. It looks like someone is living in the bat cave so not looking like the greatest spot for a cache anymore, which is a shame because the cave is so awesome and I had a bunch of fun rock climbing. I took a photo of the GZ and the plot of dirt, if the cache owner Tom873 wants to shoot me a message, I will share the picture.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15MAP_to-the-bat-cave
EarthMeat	Found it	1/13/2013	Really interesting cave! Stopped off in there before doubling back to GZ. It does actually look like someone's living on one of the outcroppings from the top.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15MAP_to-the-bat-cave

Pretty creepy if not. Took a Robin Airplane thing and a plastic whale and it appears that we left my daughter's loot from previous caches here too(a glass thingy and some sort of gemstone). Oh well, hopefully some nice little girl who is also obsessed with shiny things will find it. Cache is in great shape.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15MAP_to-the-bat-cave

Someday perhaps someone will listen to me - then again -- I think not. It's that years of experience that I DON'T have that makes me questionable hahahaha. -- but I did discover the cache; I was quick like a bunny on the trail, that's the only reason :) TNLNSL TFTC.	https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC15MAP_to-the-bat-cave
